Confined and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Stewart. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up 12% sequentially and up 78% year on year. And above our outlook, of $37.5 billion. For fiscal 2025, revenue was $130.5 billion. Up 114% in the prior year. Let's start with data center. Data center revenue for fiscal 2025 was $115.2 billion. More than doubling from the prior year. In the fourth quarter, it is in a revenue of $35.6 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and 93% year on year. As the Blackwell ramp commenced, and Hopper 200 continued to contribute growth, In Q4, Blackwell sales exceeded our expectations. We delivered $11 billion of Blackwell revenue to meet strong demand. This is the fastest product ramp in our company's history. Unprecedented in its speed and scale. Blackwell production is in full gear across multiple configurations, and we are increasing supply quickly. Expanding customer adoption. Our Q4 data center compute revenue jumped 18% sequentially and over 2x year on year. Customers are racing to scale infrastructure to train the next generation of cutting-edge models and unlock the next level of AI capabilities. With Blackwell, it will be common for these clusters to start with 100,000 GPUs or more. Shipments have already started for multiple infrastructures of this size. Post-training and model customization are fueling demand for NVIDIA Corporation infrastructure and software as developers and enterprises leverage techniques such as fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and distillation to tailor models for domain-specific use cases. Hugging Face alone hosts over 90,000 derivatives traded from the Llama Foundation model. The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude more compute than pretraining. Our inference demand is accelerating. Driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models. Like OpenAI's O3, DeepSeq R1, and Grok 3. Long-thinking reasoning AI can require 100x more compute per task compared to one-shot inferences. Blackwell was architected for reasoning AI inference. Blackwell supercharges reasoning AI models with up to 25x higher token throughput and 20x lower cost versus Hopper 100. It is revolutionary. Transformer engine is built for LLM. And mixer of experts inference. And its NVLink domain delivers 14x the throughput of PCIe Gen 5. Ensuring the response time, throughput, and cost efficiency needed to tackle the growing complexity of inferences scale. Companies across industries are tapping into NVIDIA Corporation's full-stack inference platform to boost performance and slash cost. Now tripled inference throughput and cut cost by 66% using NVIDIA Corporation TensorRT for its screenshot feature. Perplexity sees 435 million monthly queries and reduced its inference costs 3x with NVIDIA Corporation Triton inference server and TensorRT LLM. Microsoft Bing achieved a 5x speedup at major TCO savings for visual search across billions of images with NVIDIA Corporation, TensorRT, and acceleration libraries. Blackwell has great demand for inference. Many of the early GV200 deployments are earmarked for inference. A first for a new architecture. Blackwell addresses the entire AI market from pretraining, post-training, to inference across clouds, to on-premise, to enterprise. Its programmable architecture accelerates every AI model and over 4,400 applications ensuring large infrastructure investments against obsolescence in rapidly evolving markets. Our performance and pace of innovation are unmatched. We're driven to a 200% reduction in inference cost in just the last two years. We delivered the lowest TCO and the highest ROI. And full-stack optimizations for NVIDIA Corporation and our large ecosystem including 5.9 million developers continuously improve our customers' economics. In Q4, large CSPs represented about half of our data center revenue. And these sales increased nearly 2x year on year. Large CSPs were some of the first to stand up Blackwell, with Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI, bringing GV200 systems to cloud regions around the world to meet surging customer demand for AI. Regional cloud hosting NVIDIA Corporation GPUs increased as a percentage of data center revenue. Reflecting continued AI factory build-outs globally and rapidly rising demand for AI reasoning models and agents. Coreweave launched a 100,000 GV200 cluster-based instance with NVLink switch and Quantum-2 InfiniBand. Consumer Internet revenue grew 3x year on year. Driven by an expanding set of generative AI and deep learning use cases. These include recommender systems, vision language understanding, synthetic data generation search, and agentic AI. For example, XAI is adopting the GV200 to train and inference its next generation of Grok AI models. Meta's cutting-edge Andromeda, advertising engine runs on NVIDIA Corporation's Grace Hopper Superchip. Serving vast quantities of ads across Instagram, Facebook applications. Andromeda harnesses Grace Hopper's fast interconnect and large memory to boost inference, throughput by 3x. Enhanced ad personalization, and deliver meaningful jumps in monetization and ROI. Enterprise revenue increased nearly 2x year on accelerating demand model fine-tuning. Agentic AI workflows. And GPU-accelerated data processing. We introduced NVIDIA Corporation Llama Numitron model family nodes to help developers create and deploy AI agents across a range of applications, including customer support, fraud detection, and product supply chain and inventory management. Leading AI agent platform providers, including SAP and ServiceNow, are among the first to use new models. Health care leaders, IQVIA, and Lumenon. And Mayo Clinic as well as ARC and Institute are using NVIDIA Corporation AI to speed drug discovery enhance genomic research, and pioneer advanced health care services with generative and agentic AI. As AI expands beyond the digital world, NVIDIA Corporation infrastructure and software platforms are increasingly being adopted to power robotics and physical AI development. One of the early and largest robotics applications and autonomous vehicles were virtually every AV company is developing on NVIDIA Corporation, in the data center. NVIDIA Corporation's automotive vertical revenue is expected to grow to approximately $5 billion this fiscal year. At CES, Hyundai Motor Group announced it is adopting NVIDIA Corporation Technologies to accelerate AV and robotics development and smart factory initiatives. Vision transformers, self-supervised learning, multimodal sensor fusion, and high-fidelity simulation are driving breakthroughs in AV development and will require 10x more compute. At TDX, we announced the NVIDIA Corporation Cosmos World foundation model platform. Just as language foundation models have revolutionized language AI, Cosmos is a physical AI to revolutionize robotics. The robotics and automotive companies, including ride-sharing giant Uber, are among the first to adopt the platform. From a geographic perspective, sequential growth in our data center revenue was strongest in the US, driven by the initial ramp of Blackwell. Countries across the globe are building their AI ecosystems and demand for compute infrastructure is surging. France's €200 billion AI investment and the EU's €200 billion Invest AI initiative offer a glimpse into the build-out that will redefine global AI infrastructure in the coming years. Now as a percentage of total data center revenue, data center sales in China remained well below levels seen onset of export controls. China shipments absent any change in regulations, we believe that will remain roughly at the current percentage. The market in China for data center solutions remained very competitive. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Networking revenue declined 3% sequentially. Our networking attached to GPU compute systems is robust at over 75%. We are transitioning from small NVLink 8 with InfiniBand to large NVLink 72. The Spectrum X. Spectrum X and NVLink switch revenue increased and represents a major new growth sector. We expect networking a return to growth in Q1. AI requires a new class of networking. NVIDIA Corporation offers NVLink switch systems for scale of compute. For scale out, we offer Quantum InfiniBand for HPC supercomputers, and SpectrumX for Ethernet environments. Spectrum X enhances the Ethernet for AI computing and has been a huge success. Microsoft Azure OCI, Fortease, and others are building large AI factories with SpectrumX. The first Stargate data centers will use Spectrum X. Yesterday, Cisco announced integrating Spectrum X into their networking portfolio to help enterprises build AI infrastructure. With its large enterprise footprint and global reach, Cisco will bring NVIDIA Corporation Ethernet to every industry. Now moving to gaming and AR PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 22% sequentially and 11% year on year. Full year revenue of $11.4 billion increased 9% year on year. And demand remains strong throughout the holiday. However, Q4 shipments were impacted by supply constraints. We expect strong sequential growth in Q1 as supply increases. The new GeForce RTX 50 series desktop and laptop GPUs are here. Built for gamers, creators, and developers, they fuse AI and graphics, redefining visual computing. Powered by the Blackwell architecture, fifth-generation tensor cores, and fourth-generation RT cores and featuring up to 3,400 AI TOPS. These GPUs deliver a 2x performance leap and new AI-driven rendering, including neural shaders, digital human technologies, geometry, and lighting. The new DLSS 4 boosts frame rates up to 8x with AI-driven frame generation turning one rendered frame into three. It also features the industry's first real-time application of transformer models packing 2x more parameters and 4x to compute unprecedented visual fidelity. We also announced a wave of GeForce Blackwell laptop GPUs with new NVIDIA Corporation Max-Q technology that extends battery life, by up to an incredible 40%. These laptops will be available starting in March from the world's top manufacturers. Moving to our professional visualization business. Revenue of $511 million was up 5% sequentially and 10% year on year. Full year revenue of $1.9 billion increased 21% year on year. Key industry verticals driving demand include automotive and health care. NVIDIA Corporation Technologies and generative AI are reshaping design engineering, and simulation workloads. Increasingly, these technologies are being leveraged in leading software platforms. From ANSYS, Cadence, and Siemens fueling demand for NVIDIA Corporation RTX workstations. Now moving to automotive. Revenue was a record $570 million, up 27% sequentially and up 103% year on year. Full year revenue of $1.7 billion increased 55% year on year. Strong growth was driven by the continued ramp in autonomous vehicles, including cars and robotaxis. At CES, we announced Toyota the world's largest automaker will build its next generation vehicles on NVIDIA Corporation Oren, running the safety-certified NVIDIA Corporation Drive OS. We announced Aurora and Continental. Will deploy driverless trucks at scale powered by NVIDIA Corporation Drive 4. Finally, our end-to-end autonomous vehicle platform, NVIDIA Corporation DRIVE Hyperion, has passed industry safety assessments by Ryland, two of the industry's foremost authorities, automotive-grade safety and cybersecurity, NVIDIA Corporation is the first AV platform to receive a comprehensive set of third-party assessments. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins, was 73%. And non-GAAP gross margins were 73.5%. Down sequentially as expected with our first deliveries of the Blackwell architecture. As discussed last quarter, Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with several different types of NVIDIA Corporation build chips. Multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled data center. We exceeded our expectations in Q4, in ramping Blackwell, increasing system availability, providing several configurations to our customers. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to be in the low seventies. We initially, we are focused on expediting the manufacture as they race to build out Blackwell infrastructure. When fully ramped, we have many opportunities to improve the cost and gross margin. Will improve and return to the mid-seventies. Late this fiscal year. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 9% and non-GAAP operating expenses were 11%, reflecting higher engineering development costs and higher compute and infrastructure costs for new product introductions. In Q4, we returned $8.1 billion to shareholders, the form of share repurchases cash dividends. Let me turn to the outlook in the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $43 billion. Plus or minus 2%. Continuing with its strong demand, we expect a significant ramp of Blackwell in Q1. We expect sequential growth. In both data center and gaming. Within data center, we expect sequential growth from both. Compute and networking. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 70.6%. And 71% respectively. Plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.2 billion and $3.6 billion. We expect full year fiscal year 2026 operating expenses grow to grow to be in the mid-thirties. GAAP and non-GAAP other incoming expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million. Excluding gains and losses, from non-marketable and publicly held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17% plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. Including a new financial information AI agent. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the TD Cowen Healthcare Conference in Boston on March 3rd. And at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in San Francisco. On March 5th. Please join us for our annual GTC conference starting Monday, March 17th, in San Jose, California. Jensen will deliver a news-packed keynote on March 18th, and we will host a Q&A session for our financial analysts. Next day, March 19th. We look forward to seeing you at these events. Our earnings call to discuss the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2026 is scheduled for May 28th, 2025. We are going to open up the call, operator. To questions. If you could start that, that would be great.\nChrista: Thank you. At this time, I would like I also ask that you please limit yourself to one question. For any additional questions, please requeue. And your first question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, for me, Jensen, as test time compute and reinforcement learning shows such promise, we're clearly seeing increasing blurring in the lines between training and inference. What does this mean for the potential future of potentially inference-dedicated clusters? And how do you think about the overall impact to NVIDIA Corporation and your customers? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yeah. I appreciate that, C.J. There are now multiple scaling laws. There's the pretrained scaling laws. And that's gonna continue to scale because we have multimodality. We have data that came from reasoning that are now used to pretraining. And then the second is post-training scaling law. Using reinforcement learning human feedback, reinforcement learning AI feedback, reinforcement learning verifiable rewards, the amount of computation you use for post-training is actually higher than pretraining. And it's kinda sensible in the sense that you could while you're using reinforcement learning, generate an enormous amount of synthetic data or synthetically generated tokens. AI models are basically generating tokens to train AI models. That's post-train. And the third part, this is the part that you mentioned, is test time compute or reasoning. Long thinking, inference scaling, basically the same ideas. And there's you have chain of thought, you have search. The amount of tokens generated, the amount of inference compute needed, is already a hundred times more than the one-shot examples and the one-shot capabilities of large language models in the beginning and that's just the beginning. This is just the beginning. The idea that the next generation could have thousands of times and even hopefully extremely thoughtful and simulation-based and search-based models that could be hundreds of thousands, millions of times more compute than today, is in our future. And so the question is how do you design such an architecture? Some of the models are autoregressive. Some of the models are diffusion-based. Some of the times you want your data center to have disaggregated inference. Sometimes it's compacted. And so it's hard to figure out what is the best configuration of a data center, which is the reason why NVIDIA Corporation's architecture is so popular. We run every model. We are great at training. The vast majority of our compute today is actually inference, and Blackwell takes all of that to a new level. We designed Blackwell with the idea of reasoning models in mind. And you look at training, it's many times more performant. But what's really amazing is for long-thinking, test time scaling reasoning AI models, we're tens of times faster, 25 times higher throughput. And so Blackwell is gonna be incredible across the board. And when you have a data center, that allows you to configure and use your data center based on are you doing more pretraining now, post-training now? Or scaling out your inference our architecture is fungible, and easy to use. In all of those different ways. And so we're seeing, in fact, much, much more concentration of a unified architecture than ever before.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Moore: I wonder if you could talk about GV200 at CES. You sort of talked about the complexity of the rack-level systems and the challenges you have. And then as you said in the prepared remarks, we've seen a lot of general availability. You know, where are you in terms of that ramp? Are there still bottlenecks to consider at a systems level above and beyond the chip level? And just you know, have you maintained your enthusiasm for the NVLink 72 platforms?\nJensen Huang: Well, I'm more enthusiastic today than I was at CES. And the reason for that is because we shipped a lot more to CES. We have some 350 plants manufacturing the one and a half million components that go into each one of the Blackwell racks. Base Blackwell racks. Yes. It's extremely complicated. And we successfully and incredibly ramped up Grace Blackwell. Delivering some $11 billion of revenues last quarter. We're gonna have to continue to scale as demand is quite high and customers are anxious and impatient to get their Blackwell systems. You'd probably seen on the web a fair number of celebrations about Grace Blackwell Systems coming online and we have them, of course. We have a fairly large installation of Grace Blackwell for our own engineering and our own design teams and software teams. Coreweave has now gone public about the successful bring-up of theirs. Microsoft has. Of course, OpenAI has. And you're starting to see many come online. So I think the answer to your question is nothing is easy about what we're doing. But we're doing great, and all of our partners are doing great.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. Could I just you wouldn't mind confirming if Q1 is the bottom for gross margins? And then, Jensen, my question is for you. What is on your dashboard to give you the confidence that the strong demand can sustain into next year and has DeepSeq and whatever innovations they came up with, has that changed that view in any way? Thank you.\nColette Kress: Let me first take the first part of the question. Regarding the gross margin. During our Blackwell ramp, our gross margins will be in the low seventies. At this point, we are focusing on expediting our manufacturing. Expediting our manufacturing is to make sure that we can provide customers as soon as possible. Our Blackwell is fully ramped. And once it does, I'm sorry. Blackwell fully ramps, we can improve our cost and our gross margin. So we expect to probably be in the mid-seventies later this year. You know, walking through what you heard, Jensen speak about the systems and their complexity. They are customizable in some cases. They've got multiple networking options. Have liquid cool and water-cooled. So we know there is an opportunity for us to improve these gross margins going forward. But right now, we are gonna focus on getting the manufacturing plate into our customers as soon as possible.\nJensen Huang: We know several things, Vivek. We have a fairly good line of sight of the amount of capital investment that data centers are building out towards. We know that going forward, the vast majority of software is gonna be based on machine learning. And so accelerated computing and generative AI, reasoning AI, are going to be the type of architecture you want in your data center. We have, of course, forecast and plans from our top partners. And we also know that there are many innovative really exciting start-ups that are still coming online. As new opportunities for developing the next breakthroughs in AI, whether it's agentic AIs, reasoning AIs, or physical AIs. The number of start-ups are still quite vibrant and each one of them needs a fair amount of computing infrastructure. So I think the whether it's the near-term signals or the mid-term signals. Near-term signals, of course, are, you know, POs and forecasts and things like that. Mid-term signals, would be the level of infrastructure and CapEx scale out compared to previous years. And then the long-term signals it has to do with the fact that we know fundamentally software has changed. From hand coding that runs on CPUs through machine learning and AI-based software that runs on GPUs and accelerated computing systems. So we have a fairly good sense that this is the future of software. And then maybe as you roll it out, another way to think about that is we've really only touched consumer AI and search and some amount of consumer generative AI. Advertising, recommenders, kind of the early days of software. The next wave's coming. Agentic AI for enterprise, physical AI for robotics. And Sovereign AI has different regions build out their AI for their own ecosystems. And so each one of these are barely off the ground, and we can see them. We can see them because, you know, obviously, we're in the center of much of this development. And we can see great activity happening in all these different places. And these will happen. So near-term, mid-term, long-term.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Ramsay: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Your next generation Blackwell Ultra is set to launch in the second half of this year. In line with the team's annual product cadence. Jensen, can you help us understand the demand dynamics for Ultra given that you'll still be ramping the current generation Blackwell solutions? How do your customers and the supply chain also manage the simultaneous ramps of these two products and is the team still on track to execute Blackwell Ultra in the second half of this year?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Blackwell Ultra is second half. As you know, the first Blackwell was have we had a hiccup? That probably cost us a couple of months. We're fully recovered, of course. The team did an amazing job recovery. And all of our supply chain partners and just so many people helped us recover at the speed of light. And so now we've successfully ramped production of Blackwell. But that doesn't stop the next train. The next train is you know, it's on an annual rhythm. And, Blackwell Ultra with, new networking, new memories, and, of course, new processors and all of that is coming online. We've been working with all of our partners and customers laying this out. They have all of the necessary information. And we'll work with everybody to do the proper transition. This time between Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra, the system architecture is exactly the same. It's a lot harder going from Hopper to Blackwell because we went from an NVLink 8 system to a NVLink 72 base system. So the chassis, the architecture of the system, the hardware, the power delivery, all of that had to change. This was quite a challenging transition. But the next transition will slot right in. Grace Blackwell Ultra will slot right in. We've also already revealed and been working very closely with all of our partners on the click after that. And the click after that is called Vera Rubin. And, all of our partners are getting up to speed on the transition of that. And so preparing for that transition and, again, we're gonna provide a big, big, huge step up. And so come to GTC, and I'll hold on to you about Blackwell Ultra, Vera Rubin, and then show you what's the one click after that. Really, really exciting new product, so come to GTC, please.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Jensen, we hear a lot about custom ASICs. Can you kinda speak to the balance between custom ASIC and merchant GPU? We hear about some of these heterogeneous super clusters to use both GPU and ASIC. Is that something customers are planning on building or will these infrastructures remain fairly distinct? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Well, we build very different things than ASICs. In some ways, completely different in some areas we intercept. We're different in several ways. One, NVIDIA Corporation's architecture is general. You know, whether you've optimized for autoregressive models or diffusion-based models or vision-based models or multimodal models or text models. We're great in all of it. We're great in all of it because our software stack is so our architecture is responsible. Our software stack is ecosystem is so rich that we're the initial target of, you know, most exciting innovations and algorithms. And so by definition, we're much, much more general than narrow. We're also really good from the end to end. From data processing, the curation of the training data, to the training of the data, of course, to reinforcement learning used in post-training. All the way to inference with test time scaling. So, you know, we're general. We're end to end. And we're everywhere. And because we're not in just one cloud, we're in every cloud, we could be on-prem. We could be in, you know, in a robot. Our architecture is much more accessible. And a great target initial target for anybody who's starting up a new company. And so we're everywhere. And then the third thing I would say is that our performance and our rhythm is so incredibly fast. Remember that these data centers are always fixed in size. They're fixed in size or they're fixed in power. And if our performance per watt is anywhere from 2x to 4x to 8x, which is not unusual. It translates directly to revenues. And so if you have a 100-megawatt data center, if the performance or the throughput that 100-megawatt or that gigawatt data center is four times or eight times higher your revenues for that gigawatt data center is eight times higher. And the reason that is so different than data centers of the past is because AI factories are directly monetizable through its tokens generated. And so the token throughput of our architecture being so incredibly fast is just incredibly valuable to all of the companies that are building these things for revenue generation reasons. And capturing the fast ROIs. So I think the third reason is performance. And then the last thing that I would say is the software stack is incredibly hard. Building an ASIC is no different than what we do. We have to build a new architecture. And the ecosystem that sits on top of our architecture is ten times more complex today than it was two years ago. And that's fairly obvious because the amount of software this world building on top of architecture is growing exponentially and AI is advancing very quickly. So bringing that whole ecosystem on top of multiple chips is hard. And so I would say that those four reasons and then finally, I will say this. Just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed. And you've seen this over and over again. There are a lot of chips that get built. But when the time comes a business decision has to be made. And that business decision is about deploying a new engine, a new processor into a limited AI factory in size and power and find. And our technology is, you know, not only more advanced, more performant, it has much, much better software capability, and very importantly, our ability to deploy is lightning fast. And so these things are enough for the faint of heart as everybody knows now. And so there's a lot of different reasons why we do well. Why we win.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Yeah. Hi. Ben Reitzes here. Hey. Thanks a lot for the question. Hey, Jensen. It's a geography-related question. You know, you did a great job explaining some of the demand underlying, you know, factors here on the strength. But the US was up about $5 billion or so sequentially. And I think, you know, there is a concern about whether the US can pick up the slack if there's regulations towards other geographies. And I was just wondering as we go throughout the year, you know, if this kind of surge in the US continues and it's gonna be whether that's okay. And if that underlies your growth rate, how can you keep growing so fast with this mix shift towards the US? Your guidance looks like China is probably up sequentially. So just wondering if you could go through that dynamic and maybe Colette can weigh in. Thanks a lot.\nJensen Huang: China is approximately the same percentage as Q4. And as in as previous quarters. It's about half of what it was before the export control. But it's approximately the same in percentage. With respect to geographies, the takeaway is that AI is software. It's modern software. It's incredible modern software. But it's modern software. And AI has gone mainstream. AI is used in delivery services everywhere, shopping services everywhere. You know? You were to buy a quart of milk is delivered to you. AI was involved. And so almost everything that a consumer service provides AI's at the core of it. Every student will use AI as a tutor. Health care services use AI. Financial services use AI. No fintech company will not use AI. Every fintech company will. Climate tech company uses AI. Mineral Discovery now uses AI. The number of every higher education, every university, uses AI. So I think it is fairly safe to say that AI has gone mainstream. And that it's being integrated into every application. And our hope is that, of course, the technology continues to advance safely and advance in a helpful way to our society. And with that, you know, we're I do believe that we're at the beginning of this new transition. And what I mean by that in the beginning, is remember behind us has been decades of data centers and decades of computers that have been built. And they've been built for a world of hand coding and general-purpose computing. And CPUs and so on and so forth. And going forward, I think it's fairly safe to say that that world is going to be almost all software will be infused with AI. All software and all services will be based on ultimately based on machine learning, and the data flywheel is gonna part of improving software and services. And that the future computers will be accelerated. The future computers will be based on AI. And we're really three years into that journey. And in modernizing computers that have taken decades to build out. And so I'm fairly sure that we're in the beginning of this new era. And then lastly, no technology has ever had the opportunity to address a larger part of the world's GDP than AI. No software tool ever has. And so this is now a software tool that can address a much larger part of the world's GDP, more than any time in history. And so the way we think about growth and the way we think about whether something is big or small. Has to be in the context of that. And when you take a step back and look at it from that perspective, we're really just in the beginnings.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Erin, your line is open. Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMarshall Pappas: Hi. This is Marshall Pappas. Thanks for taking the question. Question. I had a clarification and a question. Colette, for the clarification. Did you say that enterprise within the data center grew 2x year on year for the January quarter? And if so, does that would that make it the faster growing than the hyperscalers? And then, Jensen, for you, the question, hyperscalers are the biggest purchasers of your solutions, but they buy equipment for both internal and external workloads, external workloads being cloud services that enterprises use. So the question is, can you give us a sense of how that hyperscale expense splits between that external workload and internal and as these new AI workflows and applications come up, would you expect enterprises to become a larger part of that consumption mix? And does that impact how you develop your service your ecosystem? Thank you.\nColette Kress: Sure. Thanks for the question regarding our enterprise business. Yes. It grew 2x. Very similar to what we were seeing with our large CSPs. Keep in mind, these are both important areas to understand. Working with the CSPs can be working on large language models. Can be working on inference on their own work? But keep in mind, that is also where the enterprises are surfacing. Your enterprises are both with your CSPs, as well as in terms of building on their own. They're both growing quite well.\nJensen Huang: The CSPs are about half of our business. And the CSPs have internal consumption, and external consumption, as you say. And we're using of course, used for internal consumption. We work very closely with all of them to optimize workloads that are internal to them because they have a large infrastructure of NVIDIA Corporation gear that they could take advantage of. And the fact that we could be used for AI on the one hand, video processing on the other hand, data processing like Spark. We're fungible. And so the useful life. Our infrastructure is much better. If the useful life is much longer, then the TCO is also lower. And so the second part is how do we see the growth of enterprise or not CSPs, if you will, going forward? And the answer is I believe, long term. It is by far larger. And the reason for that is because if you look at the computer industry today, and what is not served by the computer industry is largely industrial. Let me give you an example. When we say enterprise, and let's say let's use a car company as an example because they make both soft things and hard things. And so in the case of a car company, the employees would be what we call enterprise. And agentic AI and software planning systems and tools, and we have some really exciting things to with you guys at GTC. Those agentic systems are for employees to make employees more productive. To design, to market, plan, to operate their company. That's agentic AIs. On the other hand, the cars that they manufacture also need AI. They need an AI system that trains the cars treats this entire giant fleet of cars, and you know, today, there's some billion cars on the road. Someday, there'd be a billion cars on the road, and every single one of those cars will be, you know, robotic cars. And they'll all be collecting data, and we'll be improving them using an AI factory where they whereas they have a car factory today, in the future, they'll have a car factory and an AI factory. And then inside the car itself is a robotic system. And so as you can see, there are three computers involved. And there's the computer that helps the people. There's the computer that builds the AI for it. The machineries. It could be, of course. Could be a tractor. It could be a lawnmower. It could be a human or a robot that's being developed today. It could be a building. It could be a warehouse. These physical systems require a new type of AI we call physical AI. They can't just understand the meaning of words and languages but they have to understand the meaning of the world. Friction and inertia, object permanence, and cause and effect, and all of those types of things that are common sense to you and I. But you know, AI has to go learn those physical effects. So we call that physical AI. That whole part of using agentic AI to revolutionize the way we work inside companies. That's just starting. This is now the beginning of the agentic AI era. And you hear a lot of people talking about it and got some really great things going on. And then there's the physical AI after that, and then there's robotic systems after that. And so these three computers are all brand new. And my sense is that long term, this will be by far a larger of a mold which kinda makes sense. You know, the world the world's GDP is represented by either heavy industries industrials. And companies that are providing for those.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for letting me back in. Jensen, I'm curious as we now approach the two-year anniversary of really the Hopper inflection that you saw in 2023 in Gen AI in general. We think about the roadmap you have in front of us, how do you think about the infrastructure that's been deployed from a replacement cycle perspective and whether, you know, if it's GV300 or if it's the Rubin cycle where we start to see maybe some refresh opportunity. I'm just curious to how you look at that.\nJensen Huang: Yeah. I appreciate it. First of all, people are still using Voltas. And Pascals, and Amperes. And the reason for that is because they're always things that because CUDA is so programmable, you could use it right well, one of the major use cases right now is data processing and data curation. You find a circumstance that an AI model is not very good at? You present that circumstance to a vision language model, let's say. Let's say it's a car? You present that circumstance to a vision language model, the vision language model actually looks at the circumstances. It's a this isn't this is what happened, and I wasn't very good at it. You then take that response, this the prompt, and you go and prompt an AI model to go find in your whole link of data of other circumstances like that. Whatever that circumstance was. And then you use an AI to do domain randomization and generate a whole bunch of other examples. And then from that, you can go train the model. And so you could use the Amperes to go and do data processing and data curation and machine learning-based search. And then you create the training dataset, which you then present to your Hopper systems for training. And so each one of these architectures are completely are you know, they're all CUDA compatible, and so everything runs on everything. But if you have infrastructure in place, and you can put the less intensive workloads onto the installed base of the past. All of our CPUs are very well employed.\nChrista: We have time for one more question, and that question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I have a follow-up question on gross margins, Colette. I understand there are many moving parts that will yield and NVLink 72 and Ethernet mix. And you kind of tiptoed the earlier question if April quarter is the bottom. But second half would have to ramp, like, 200 basis point per quarter to get to the mid-seventies range that you're giving, for the end of the fiscal year. And we still don't know much about tariffs impact to broader semiconductor. So what kind of gives you the confidence in that trajectory in the back half of this year?\nColette Kress: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our gross margins, they're quite complex. In terms of the material. And everything that we put together in a Blackwell system. Tremendous amount of opportunity to look at a lot of different pieces of that. On how we can better improve our gross margins over time. Remember, we have many different configurations as well. On Blackwell. That will be able to help us do that. So, together, working after we get some of these really strong ramping completed for our customers we can begin a lot of that work. If not, we're gonna probably start as soon as possible. If we can improve it in the short term, we will also do that. Tariffs, at this point, it's a little bit of an unknown. It's an unknown until we understand further what the US government's plan is, its timing, it's where, and how much. So at this time, we are awaiting but again, we would, of course, always follow export control and or tariffs in that manner.\nChrista: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question and answer session. I'm sorry. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: No. No. I'm gonna just wanna thank you. Up to, Jensen? And, like, the medium, a couple things. I just wanna thank you. Thank you, Colette. Demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception. And generative AI into reasoning. With reasoning AI, we're observing another scaling law. Inference time or test time scaling. The more computation the more the model thinks the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAI's Grok 3, DeepSeq R1, are reasoning models that apply inference time scale. Reasoning models can consume a hundred times more compute. Future reasoning models can consume much more compute. DeepSeq R1 has ignited global enthusiasm. It's an excellent innovation. But even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model. Nearly every AI developer is applying R1. Or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques like R1. To scale their model's performance. We now have three scaling laws, as I mentioned earlier. Driving the demand for AI computing. The traditional scaling laws of AI remain intact. Foundation models are being enhanced with multimodality. And pretraining is still growing. But it's no longer enough. We have two additional scaling dimensions. Post-training scaling, where reinforcement learning fine-tuning, model distillation, require orders of magnitude more compute than pretraining alone. Inference time scaling and reasoning where a single query can demand a hundred times more compute. We designed Blackwell for this moment a single platform that can easily transition from pretraining, post-training, and test time scaling. Blackwell's MP4 transformer engine, and NVLink 72 scale-up fabric. And new software technologies let Blackwell process reasoning AI models 25 times faster than Hopper. Blackwell, in all of these configurations, is in full production. Each Grace Blackwell NVLink 72 rack is an engineering marvel. One and a half million components produced across 350 manufacturing sites by nearly a hundred thousand factory operators. AI is advancing at light speed. We're at the beginning of reasoning AI and inference time scaling. But we're just at the start of the age of AI. Multimodal AIs. Enterprise AI, Sovereign AI. And physical AI are right around the corner. We will grow strongly in 2025. Going forward, data centers will dedicate most of CapEx to accelerated computing and AI. Data centers will increasingly become AI factories. And every company will have a either rented or self-operated. I wanna thank all of you for joining us today. Come join us at GTC in a couple of weeks gonna be talking about Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and other new computing networking, reasoning AI, physical AI products. And a whole bunch more. Thank you.\nChrista: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Stewart. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up 12% sequentially and up 78% year on year. And above our outlook, of $37.5 billion. For fiscal 2025, revenue was $130.5 billion. Up 114% in the prior year. Let's start with data center. Data center revenue for fiscal 2025 was $115.2 billion. More than doubling from the prior year. In the fourth quarter, it is in a revenue of $35.6 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and 93% year on year. As the Blackwell ramp commenced, and Hopper 200 continued to contribute growth, In Q4, Blackwell sales exceeded our expectations. We delivered $11 billion of Blackwell revenue to meet strong demand. This is the fastest product ramp in our company's history. Unprecedented in its speed and scale. Blackwell production is in full gear across multiple configurations, and we are increasing supply quickly. Expanding customer adoption. Our Q4 data center compute revenue jumped 18% sequentially and over 2x year on year. Customers are racing to scale infrastructure to train the next generation of cutting-edge models and unlock the next level of AI capabilities. With Blackwell, it will be common for these clusters to start with 100,000 GPUs or more. Shipments have already started for multiple infrastructures of this size. Post-training and model customization are fueling demand for NVIDIA Corporation infrastructure and software as developers and enterprises leverage techniques such as fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and distillation to tailor models for domain-specific use cases. Hugging Face alone hosts over 90,000 derivatives traded from the Llama Foundation model. The scale of post-training and model customization is massive and can collectively demand orders of magnitude more compute than pretraining. Our inference demand is accelerating. Driven by test time scaling and new reasoning models. Like OpenAI's O3, DeepSeq R1, and Grok 3. Long-thinking reasoning AI can require 100x more compute per task compared to one-shot inferences. Blackwell was architected for reasoning AI inference. Blackwell supercharges reasoning AI models with up to 25x higher token throughput and 20x lower cost versus Hopper 100. It is revolutionary. Transformer engine is built for LLM. And mixer of experts inference. And its NVLink domain delivers 14x the throughput of PCIe Gen 5. Ensuring the response time, throughput, and cost efficiency needed to tackle the growing complexity of inferences scale. Companies across industries are tapping into NVIDIA Corporation's full-stack inference platform to boost performance and slash cost. Now tripled inference throughput and cut cost by 66% using NVIDIA Corporation TensorRT for its screenshot feature. Perplexity sees 435 million monthly queries and reduced its inference costs 3x with NVIDIA Corporation Triton inference server and TensorRT LLM. Microsoft Bing achieved a 5x speedup at major TCO savings for visual search across billions of images with NVIDIA Corporation, TensorRT, and acceleration libraries. Blackwell has great demand for inference. Many of the early GV200 deployments are earmarked for inference. A first for a new architecture. Blackwell addresses the entire AI market from pretraining, post-training, to inference across clouds, to on-premise, to enterprise. Its programmable architecture accelerates every AI model and over 4,400 applications ensuring large infrastructure investments against obsolescence in rapidly evolving markets. Our performance and pace of innovation are unmatched. We're driven to a 200% reduction in inference cost in just the last two years. We delivered the lowest TCO and the highest ROI. And full-stack optimizations for NVIDIA Corporation and our large ecosystem including 5.9 million developers continuously improve our customers' economics. In Q4, large CSPs represented about half of our data center revenue. And these sales increased nearly 2x year on year. Large CSPs were some of the first to stand up Blackwell, with Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI, bringing GV200 systems to cloud regions around the world to meet surging customer demand for AI. Regional cloud hosting NVIDIA Corporation GPUs increased as a percentage of data center revenue. Reflecting continued AI factory build-outs globally and rapidly rising demand for AI reasoning models and agents. Coreweave launched a 100,000 GV200 cluster-based instance with NVLink switch and Quantum-2 InfiniBand. Consumer Internet revenue grew 3x year on year. Driven by an expanding set of generative AI and deep learning use cases. These include recommender systems, vision language understanding, synthetic data generation search, and agentic AI. For example, XAI is adopting the GV200 to train and inference its next generation of Grok AI models. Meta's cutting-edge Andromeda, advertising engine runs on NVIDIA Corporation's Grace Hopper Superchip. Serving vast quantities of ads across Instagram, Facebook applications. Andromeda harnesses Grace Hopper's fast interconnect and large memory to boost inference, throughput by 3x. Enhanced ad personalization, and deliver meaningful jumps in monetization and ROI. Enterprise revenue increased nearly 2x year on accelerating demand model fine-tuning. Agentic AI workflows. And GPU-accelerated data processing. We introduced NVIDIA Corporation Llama Numitron model family nodes to help developers create and deploy AI agents across a range of applications, including customer support, fraud detection, and product supply chain and inventory management. Leading AI agent platform providers, including SAP and ServiceNow, are among the first to use new models. Health care leaders, IQVIA, and Lumenon. And Mayo Clinic as well as ARC and Institute are using NVIDIA Corporation AI to speed drug discovery enhance genomic research, and pioneer advanced health care services with generative and agentic AI. As AI expands beyond the digital world, NVIDIA Corporation infrastructure and software platforms are increasingly being adopted to power robotics and physical AI development. One of the early and largest robotics applications and autonomous vehicles were virtually every AV company is developing on NVIDIA Corporation, in the data center. NVIDIA Corporation's automotive vertical revenue is expected to grow to approximately $5 billion this fiscal year. At CES, Hyundai Motor Group announced it is adopting NVIDIA Corporation Technologies to accelerate AV and robotics development and smart factory initiatives. Vision transformers, self-supervised learning, multimodal sensor fusion, and high-fidelity simulation are driving breakthroughs in AV development and will require 10x more compute. At TDX, we announced the NVIDIA Corporation Cosmos World foundation model platform. Just as language foundation models have revolutionized language AI, Cosmos is a physical AI to revolutionize robotics. The robotics and automotive companies, including ride-sharing giant Uber, are among the first to adopt the platform. From a geographic perspective, sequential growth in our data center revenue was strongest in the US, driven by the initial ramp of Blackwell. Countries across the globe are building their AI ecosystems and demand for compute infrastructure is surging. France's €200 billion AI investment and the EU's €200 billion Invest AI initiative offer a glimpse into the build-out that will redefine global AI infrastructure in the coming years. Now as a percentage of total data center revenue, data center sales in China remained well below levels seen onset of export controls. China shipments absent any change in regulations, we believe that will remain roughly at the current percentage. The market in China for data center solutions remained very competitive. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Networking revenue declined 3% sequentially. Our networking attached to GPU compute systems is robust at over 75%. We are transitioning from small NVLink 8 with InfiniBand to large NVLink 72. The Spectrum X. Spectrum X and NVLink switch revenue increased and represents a major new growth sector. We expect networking a return to growth in Q1. AI requires a new class of networking. NVIDIA Corporation offers NVLink switch systems for scale of compute. For scale out, we offer Quantum InfiniBand for HPC supercomputers, and SpectrumX for Ethernet environments. Spectrum X enhances the Ethernet for AI computing and has been a huge success. Microsoft Azure OCI, Fortease, and others are building large AI factories with SpectrumX. The first Stargate data centers will use Spectrum X. Yesterday, Cisco announced integrating Spectrum X into their networking portfolio to help enterprises build AI infrastructure. With its large enterprise footprint and global reach, Cisco will bring NVIDIA Corporation Ethernet to every industry. Now moving to gaming and AR PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 22% sequentially and 11% year on year. Full year revenue of $11.4 billion increased 9% year on year. And demand remains strong throughout the holiday. However, Q4 shipments were impacted by supply constraints. We expect strong sequential growth in Q1 as supply increases. The new GeForce RTX 50 series desktop and laptop GPUs are here. Built for gamers, creators, and developers, they fuse AI and graphics, redefining visual computing. Powered by the Blackwell architecture, fifth-generation tensor cores, and fourth-generation RT cores and featuring up to 3,400 AI TOPS. These GPUs deliver a 2x performance leap and new AI-driven rendering, including neural shaders, digital human technologies, geometry, and lighting. The new DLSS 4 boosts frame rates up to 8x with AI-driven frame generation turning one rendered frame into three. It also features the industry's first real-time application of transformer models packing 2x more parameters and 4x to compute unprecedented visual fidelity. We also announced a wave of GeForce Blackwell laptop GPUs with new NVIDIA Corporation Max-Q technology that extends battery life, by up to an incredible 40%. These laptops will be available starting in March from the world's top manufacturers. Moving to our professional visualization business. Revenue of $511 million was up 5% sequentially and 10% year on year. Full year revenue of $1.9 billion increased 21% year on year. Key industry verticals driving demand include automotive and health care. NVIDIA Corporation Technologies and generative AI are reshaping design engineering, and simulation workloads. Increasingly, these technologies are being leveraged in leading software platforms. From ANSYS, Cadence, and Siemens fueling demand for NVIDIA Corporation RTX workstations. Now moving to automotive. Revenue was a record $570 million, up 27% sequentially and up 103% year on year. Full year revenue of $1.7 billion increased 55% year on year. Strong growth was driven by the continued ramp in autonomous vehicles, including cars and robotaxis. At CES, we announced Toyota the world's largest automaker will build its next generation vehicles on NVIDIA Corporation Oren, running the safety-certified NVIDIA Corporation Drive OS. We announced Aurora and Continental. Will deploy driverless trucks at scale powered by NVIDIA Corporation Drive 4. Finally, our end-to-end autonomous vehicle platform, NVIDIA Corporation DRIVE Hyperion, has passed industry safety assessments by Ryland, two of the industry's foremost authorities, automotive-grade safety and cybersecurity, NVIDIA Corporation is the first AV platform to receive a comprehensive set of third-party assessments. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins, was 73%. And non-GAAP gross margins were 73.5%. Down sequentially as expected with our first deliveries of the Blackwell architecture. As discussed last quarter, Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with several different types of NVIDIA Corporation build chips. Multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled data center. We exceeded our expectations in Q4, in ramping Blackwell, increasing system availability, providing several configurations to our customers. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to be in the low seventies. We initially, we are focused on expediting the manufacture as they race to build out Blackwell infrastructure. When fully ramped, we have many opportunities to improve the cost and gross margin. Will improve and return to the mid-seventies. Late this fiscal year. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 9% and non-GAAP operating expenses were 11%, reflecting higher engineering development costs and higher compute and infrastructure costs for new product introductions. In Q4, we returned $8.1 billion to shareholders, the form of share repurchases cash dividends. Let me turn to the outlook in the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $43 billion. Plus or minus 2%. Continuing with its strong demand, we expect a significant ramp of Blackwell in Q1. We expect sequential growth. In both data center and gaming. Within data center, we expect sequential growth from both. Compute and networking. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 70.6%. And 71% respectively. Plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $5.2 billion and $3.6 billion. We expect full year fiscal year 2026 operating expenses grow to grow to be in the mid-thirties. GAAP and non-GAAP other incoming expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million. Excluding gains and losses, from non-marketable and publicly held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17% plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. Including a new financial information AI agent. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be at the TD Cowen Healthcare Conference in Boston on March 3rd. And at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in San Francisco. On March 5th. Please join us for our annual GTC conference starting Monday, March 17th, in San Jose, California. Jensen will deliver a news-packed keynote on March 18th, and we will host a Q&A session for our financial analysts. Next day, March 19th. We look forward to seeing you at these events. Our earnings call to discuss the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2026 is scheduled for May 28th, 2025. We are going to open up the call, operator. To questions. If you could start that, that would be great.\nChrista: Thank you. At this time, I would like I also ask that you please limit yourself to one question. For any additional questions, please requeue. And your first question comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, for me, Jensen, as test time compute and reinforcement learning shows such promise, we're clearly seeing increasing blurring in the lines between training and inference. What does this mean for the potential future of potentially inference-dedicated clusters? And how do you think about the overall impact to NVIDIA Corporation and your customers? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yeah. I appreciate that, C.J. There are now multiple scaling laws. There's the pretrained scaling laws. And that's gonna continue to scale because we have multimodality. We have data that came from reasoning that are now used to pretraining. And then the second is post-training scaling law. Using reinforcement learning human feedback, reinforcement learning AI feedback, reinforcement learning verifiable rewards, the amount of computation you use for post-training is actually higher than pretraining. And it's kinda sensible in the sense that you could while you're using reinforcement learning, generate an enormous amount of synthetic data or synthetically generated tokens. AI models are basically generating tokens to train AI models. That's post-train. And the third part, this is the part that you mentioned, is test time compute or reasoning. Long thinking, inference scaling, basically the same ideas. And there's you have chain of thought, you have search. The amount of tokens generated, the amount of inference compute needed, is already a hundred times more than the one-shot examples and the one-shot capabilities of large language models in the beginning and that's just the beginning. This is just the beginning. The idea that the next generation could have thousands of times and even hopefully extremely thoughtful and simulation-based and search-based models that could be hundreds of thousands, millions of times more compute than today, is in our future. And so the question is how do you design such an architecture? Some of the models are autoregressive. Some of the models are diffusion-based. Some of the times you want your data center to have disaggregated inference. Sometimes it's compacted. And so it's hard to figure out what is the best configuration of a data center, which is the reason why NVIDIA Corporation's architecture is so popular. We run every model. We are great at training. The vast majority of our compute today is actually inference, and Blackwell takes all of that to a new level. We designed Blackwell with the idea of reasoning models in mind. And you look at training, it's many times more performant. But what's really amazing is for long-thinking, test time scaling reasoning AI models, we're tens of times faster, 25 times higher throughput. And so Blackwell is gonna be incredible across the board. And when you have a data center, that allows you to configure and use your data center based on are you doing more pretraining now, post-training now? Or scaling out your inference our architecture is fungible, and easy to use. In all of those different ways. And so we're seeing, in fact, much, much more concentration of a unified architecture than ever before.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Moore: I wonder if you could talk about GV200 at CES. You sort of talked about the complexity of the rack-level systems and the challenges you have. And then as you said in the prepared remarks, we've seen a lot of general availability. You know, where are you in terms of that ramp? Are there still bottlenecks to consider at a systems level above and beyond the chip level? And just you know, have you maintained your enthusiasm for the NVLink 72 platforms?\nJensen Huang: Well, I'm more enthusiastic today than I was at CES. And the reason for that is because we shipped a lot more to CES. We have some 350 plants manufacturing the one and a half million components that go into each one of the Blackwell racks. Base Blackwell racks. Yes. It's extremely complicated. And we successfully and incredibly ramped up Grace Blackwell. Delivering some $11 billion of revenues last quarter. We're gonna have to continue to scale as demand is quite high and customers are anxious and impatient to get their Blackwell systems. You'd probably seen on the web a fair number of celebrations about Grace Blackwell Systems coming online and we have them, of course. We have a fairly large installation of Grace Blackwell for our own engineering and our own design teams and software teams. Coreweave has now gone public about the successful bring-up of theirs. Microsoft has. Of course, OpenAI has. And you're starting to see many come online. So I think the answer to your question is nothing is easy about what we're doing. But we're doing great, and all of our partners are doing great.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. Could I just you wouldn't mind confirming if Q1 is the bottom for gross margins? And then, Jensen, my question is for you. What is on your dashboard to give you the confidence that the strong demand can sustain into next year and has DeepSeq and whatever innovations they came up with, has that changed that view in any way? Thank you.\nColette Kress: Let me first take the first part of the question. Regarding the gross margin. During our Blackwell ramp, our gross margins will be in the low seventies. At this point, we are focusing on expediting our manufacturing. Expediting our manufacturing is to make sure that we can provide customers as soon as possible. Our Blackwell is fully ramped. And once it does, I'm sorry. Blackwell fully ramps, we can improve our cost and our gross margin. So we expect to probably be in the mid-seventies later this year. You know, walking through what you heard, Jensen speak about the systems and their complexity. They are customizable in some cases. They've got multiple networking options. Have liquid cool and water-cooled. So we know there is an opportunity for us to improve these gross margins going forward. But right now, we are gonna focus on getting the manufacturing plate into our customers as soon as possible.\nJensen Huang: We know several things, Vivek. We have a fairly good line of sight of the amount of capital investment that data centers are building out towards. We know that going forward, the vast majority of software is gonna be based on machine learning. And so accelerated computing and generative AI, reasoning AI, are going to be the type of architecture you want in your data center. We have, of course, forecast and plans from our top partners. And we also know that there are many innovative really exciting start-ups that are still coming online. As new opportunities for developing the next breakthroughs in AI, whether it's agentic AIs, reasoning AIs, or physical AIs. The number of start-ups are still quite vibrant and each one of them needs a fair amount of computing infrastructure. So I think the whether it's the near-term signals or the mid-term signals. Near-term signals, of course, are, you know, POs and forecasts and things like that. Mid-term signals, would be the level of infrastructure and CapEx scale out compared to previous years. And then the long-term signals it has to do with the fact that we know fundamentally software has changed. From hand coding that runs on CPUs through machine learning and AI-based software that runs on GPUs and accelerated computing systems. So we have a fairly good sense that this is the future of software. And then maybe as you roll it out, another way to think about that is we've really only touched consumer AI and search and some amount of consumer generative AI. Advertising, recommenders, kind of the early days of software. The next wave's coming. Agentic AI for enterprise, physical AI for robotics. And Sovereign AI has different regions build out their AI for their own ecosystems. And so each one of these are barely off the ground, and we can see them. We can see them because, you know, obviously, we're in the center of much of this development. And we can see great activity happening in all these different places. And these will happen. So near-term, mid-term, long-term.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Ramsay: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Your next generation Blackwell Ultra is set to launch in the second half of this year. In line with the team's annual product cadence. Jensen, can you help us understand the demand dynamics for Ultra given that you'll still be ramping the current generation Blackwell solutions? How do your customers and the supply chain also manage the simultaneous ramps of these two products and is the team still on track to execute Blackwell Ultra in the second half of this year?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Blackwell Ultra is second half. As you know, the first Blackwell was have we had a hiccup? That probably cost us a couple of months. We're fully recovered, of course. The team did an amazing job recovery. And all of our supply chain partners and just so many people helped us recover at the speed of light. And so now we've successfully ramped production of Blackwell. But that doesn't stop the next train. The next train is you know, it's on an annual rhythm. And, Blackwell Ultra with, new networking, new memories, and, of course, new processors and all of that is coming online. We've been working with all of our partners and customers laying this out. They have all of the necessary information. And we'll work with everybody to do the proper transition. This time between Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra, the system architecture is exactly the same. It's a lot harder going from Hopper to Blackwell because we went from an NVLink 8 system to a NVLink 72 base system. So the chassis, the architecture of the system, the hardware, the power delivery, all of that had to change. This was quite a challenging transition. But the next transition will slot right in. Grace Blackwell Ultra will slot right in. We've also already revealed and been working very closely with all of our partners on the click after that. And the click after that is called Vera Rubin. And, all of our partners are getting up to speed on the transition of that. And so preparing for that transition and, again, we're gonna provide a big, big, huge step up. And so come to GTC, and I'll hold on to you about Blackwell Ultra, Vera Rubin, and then show you what's the one click after that. Really, really exciting new product, so come to GTC, please.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Jensen, we hear a lot about custom ASICs. Can you kinda speak to the balance between custom ASIC and merchant GPU? We hear about some of these heterogeneous super clusters to use both GPU and ASIC. Is that something customers are planning on building or will these infrastructures remain fairly distinct? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Well, we build very different things than ASICs. In some ways, completely different in some areas we intercept. We're different in several ways. One, NVIDIA Corporation's architecture is general. You know, whether you've optimized for autoregressive models or diffusion-based models or vision-based models or multimodal models or text models. We're great in all of it. We're great in all of it because our software stack is so our architecture is responsible. Our software stack is ecosystem is so rich that we're the initial target of, you know, most exciting innovations and algorithms. And so by definition, we're much, much more general than narrow. We're also really good from the end to end. From data processing, the curation of the training data, to the training of the data, of course, to reinforcement learning used in post-training. All the way to inference with test time scaling. So, you know, we're general. We're end to end. And we're everywhere. And because we're not in just one cloud, we're in every cloud, we could be on-prem. We could be in, you know, in a robot. Our architecture is much more accessible. And a great target initial target for anybody who's starting up a new company. And so we're everywhere. And then the third thing I would say is that our performance and our rhythm is so incredibly fast. Remember that these data centers are always fixed in size. They're fixed in size or they're fixed in power. And if our performance per watt is anywhere from 2x to 4x to 8x, which is not unusual. It translates directly to revenues. And so if you have a 100-megawatt data center, if the performance or the throughput that 100-megawatt or that gigawatt data center is four times or eight times higher your revenues for that gigawatt data center is eight times higher. And the reason that is so different than data centers of the past is because AI factories are directly monetizable through its tokens generated. And so the token throughput of our architecture being so incredibly fast is just incredibly valuable to all of the companies that are building these things for revenue generation reasons. And capturing the fast ROIs. So I think the third reason is performance. And then the last thing that I would say is the software stack is incredibly hard. Building an ASIC is no different than what we do. We have to build a new architecture. And the ecosystem that sits on top of our architecture is ten times more complex today than it was two years ago. And that's fairly obvious because the amount of software this world building on top of architecture is growing exponentially and AI is advancing very quickly. So bringing that whole ecosystem on top of multiple chips is hard. And so I would say that those four reasons and then finally, I will say this. Just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed. And you've seen this over and over again. There are a lot of chips that get built. But when the time comes a business decision has to be made. And that business decision is about deploying a new engine, a new processor into a limited AI factory in size and power and find. And our technology is, you know, not only more advanced, more performant, it has much, much better software capability, and very importantly, our ability to deploy is lightning fast. And so these things are enough for the faint of heart as everybody knows now. And so there's a lot of different reasons why we do well. Why we win.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Yeah. Hi. Ben Reitzes here. Hey. Thanks a lot for the question. Hey, Jensen. It's a geography-related question. You know, you did a great job explaining some of the demand underlying, you know, factors here on the strength. But the US was up about $5 billion or so sequentially. And I think, you know, there is a concern about whether the US can pick up the slack if there's regulations towards other geographies. And I was just wondering as we go throughout the year, you know, if this kind of surge in the US continues and it's gonna be whether that's okay. And if that underlies your growth rate, how can you keep growing so fast with this mix shift towards the US? Your guidance looks like China is probably up sequentially. So just wondering if you could go through that dynamic and maybe Colette can weigh in. Thanks a lot.\nJensen Huang: China is approximately the same percentage as Q4. And as in as previous quarters. It's about half of what it was before the export control. But it's approximately the same in percentage. With respect to geographies, the takeaway is that AI is software. It's modern software. It's incredible modern software. But it's modern software. And AI has gone mainstream. AI is used in delivery services everywhere, shopping services everywhere. You know? You were to buy a quart of milk is delivered to you. AI was involved. And so almost everything that a consumer service provides AI's at the core of it. Every student will use AI as a tutor. Health care services use AI. Financial services use AI. No fintech company will not use AI. Every fintech company will. Climate tech company uses AI. Mineral Discovery now uses AI. The number of every higher education, every university, uses AI. So I think it is fairly safe to say that AI has gone mainstream. And that it's being integrated into every application. And our hope is that, of course, the technology continues to advance safely and advance in a helpful way to our society. And with that, you know, we're I do believe that we're at the beginning of this new transition. And what I mean by that in the beginning, is remember behind us has been decades of data centers and decades of computers that have been built. And they've been built for a world of hand coding and general-purpose computing. And CPUs and so on and so forth. And going forward, I think it's fairly safe to say that that world is going to be almost all software will be infused with AI. All software and all services will be based on ultimately based on machine learning, and the data flywheel is gonna part of improving software and services. And that the future computers will be accelerated. The future computers will be based on AI. And we're really three years into that journey. And in modernizing computers that have taken decades to build out. And so I'm fairly sure that we're in the beginning of this new era. And then lastly, no technology has ever had the opportunity to address a larger part of the world's GDP than AI. No software tool ever has. And so this is now a software tool that can address a much larger part of the world's GDP, more than any time in history. And so the way we think about growth and the way we think about whether something is big or small. Has to be in the context of that. And when you take a step back and look at it from that perspective, we're really just in the beginnings.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Erin, your line is open. Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMarshall Pappas: Hi. This is Marshall Pappas. Thanks for taking the question. Question. I had a clarification and a question. Colette, for the clarification. Did you say that enterprise within the data center grew 2x year on year for the January quarter? And if so, does that would that make it the faster growing than the hyperscalers? And then, Jensen, for you, the question, hyperscalers are the biggest purchasers of your solutions, but they buy equipment for both internal and external workloads, external workloads being cloud services that enterprises use. So the question is, can you give us a sense of how that hyperscale expense splits between that external workload and internal and as these new AI workflows and applications come up, would you expect enterprises to become a larger part of that consumption mix? And does that impact how you develop your service your ecosystem? Thank you.\nColette Kress: Sure. Thanks for the question regarding our enterprise business. Yes. It grew 2x. Very similar to what we were seeing with our large CSPs. Keep in mind, these are both important areas to understand. Working with the CSPs can be working on large language models. Can be working on inference on their own work? But keep in mind, that is also where the enterprises are surfacing. Your enterprises are both with your CSPs, as well as in terms of building on their own. They're both growing quite well.\nJensen Huang: The CSPs are about half of our business. And the CSPs have internal consumption, and external consumption, as you say. And we're using of course, used for internal consumption. We work very closely with all of them to optimize workloads that are internal to them because they have a large infrastructure of NVIDIA Corporation gear that they could take advantage of. And the fact that we could be used for AI on the one hand, video processing on the other hand, data processing like Spark. We're fungible. And so the useful life. Our infrastructure is much better. If the useful life is much longer, then the TCO is also lower. And so the second part is how do we see the growth of enterprise or not CSPs, if you will, going forward? And the answer is I believe, long term. It is by far larger. And the reason for that is because if you look at the computer industry today, and what is not served by the computer industry is largely industrial. Let me give you an example. When we say enterprise, and let's say let's use a car company as an example because they make both soft things and hard things. And so in the case of a car company, the employees would be what we call enterprise. And agentic AI and software planning systems and tools, and we have some really exciting things to with you guys at GTC. Those agentic systems are for employees to make employees more productive. To design, to market, plan, to operate their company. That's agentic AIs. On the other hand, the cars that they manufacture also need AI. They need an AI system that trains the cars treats this entire giant fleet of cars, and you know, today, there's some billion cars on the road. Someday, there'd be a billion cars on the road, and every single one of those cars will be, you know, robotic cars. And they'll all be collecting data, and we'll be improving them using an AI factory where they whereas they have a car factory today, in the future, they'll have a car factory and an AI factory. And then inside the car itself is a robotic system. And so as you can see, there are three computers involved. And there's the computer that helps the people. There's the computer that builds the AI for it. The machineries. It could be, of course. Could be a tractor. It could be a lawnmower. It could be a human or a robot that's being developed today. It could be a building. It could be a warehouse. These physical systems require a new type of AI we call physical AI. They can't just understand the meaning of words and languages but they have to understand the meaning of the world. Friction and inertia, object permanence, and cause and effect, and all of those types of things that are common sense to you and I. But you know, AI has to go learn those physical effects. So we call that physical AI. That whole part of using agentic AI to revolutionize the way we work inside companies. That's just starting. This is now the beginning of the agentic AI era. And you hear a lot of people talking about it and got some really great things going on. And then there's the physical AI after that, and then there's robotic systems after that. And so these three computers are all brand new. And my sense is that long term, this will be by far a larger of a mold which kinda makes sense. You know, the world the world's GDP is represented by either heavy industries industrials. And companies that are providing for those.\nChrista: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for letting me back in. Jensen, I'm curious as we now approach the two-year anniversary of really the Hopper inflection that you saw in 2023 in Gen AI in general. We think about the roadmap you have in front of us, how do you think about the infrastructure that's been deployed from a replacement cycle perspective and whether, you know, if it's GV300 or if it's the Rubin cycle where we start to see maybe some refresh opportunity. I'm just curious to how you look at that.\nJensen Huang: Yeah. I appreciate it. First of all, people are still using Voltas. And Pascals, and Amperes. And the reason for that is because they're always things that because CUDA is so programmable, you could use it right well, one of the major use cases right now is data processing and data curation. You find a circumstance that an AI model is not very good at? You present that circumstance to a vision language model, let's say. Let's say it's a car? You present that circumstance to a vision language model, the vision language model actually looks at the circumstances. It's a this isn't this is what happened, and I wasn't very good at it. You then take that response, this the prompt, and you go and prompt an AI model to go find in your whole link of data of other circumstances like that. Whatever that circumstance was. And then you use an AI to do domain randomization and generate a whole bunch of other examples. And then from that, you can go train the model. And so you could use the Amperes to go and do data processing and data curation and machine learning-based search. And then you create the training dataset, which you then present to your Hopper systems for training. And so each one of these architectures are completely are you know, they're all CUDA compatible, and so everything runs on everything. But if you have infrastructure in place, and you can put the less intensive workloads onto the installed base of the past. All of our CPUs are very well employed.\nChrista: We have time for one more question, and that question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I have a follow-up question on gross margins, Colette. I understand there are many moving parts that will yield and NVLink 72 and Ethernet mix. And you kind of tiptoed the earlier question if April quarter is the bottom. But second half would have to ramp, like, 200 basis point per quarter to get to the mid-seventies range that you're giving, for the end of the fiscal year. And we still don't know much about tariffs impact to broader semiconductor. So what kind of gives you the confidence in that trajectory in the back half of this year?\nColette Kress: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our gross margins, they're quite complex. In terms of the material. And everything that we put together in a Blackwell system. Tremendous amount of opportunity to look at a lot of different pieces of that. On how we can better improve our gross margins over time. Remember, we have many different configurations as well. On Blackwell. That will be able to help us do that. So, together, working after we get some of these really strong ramping completed for our customers we can begin a lot of that work. If not, we're gonna probably start as soon as possible. If we can improve it in the short term, we will also do that. Tariffs, at this point, it's a little bit of an unknown. It's an unknown until we understand further what the US government's plan is, its timing, it's where, and how much. So at this time, we are awaiting but again, we would, of course, always follow export control and or tariffs in that manner.\nChrista: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question and answer session. I'm sorry. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: No. No. I'm gonna just wanna thank you. Up to, Jensen? And, like, the medium, a couple things. I just wanna thank you. Thank you, Colette. Demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception. And generative AI into reasoning. With reasoning AI, we're observing another scaling law. Inference time or test time scaling. The more computation the more the model thinks the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAI's Grok 3, DeepSeq R1, are reasoning models that apply inference time scale. Reasoning models can consume a hundred times more compute. Future reasoning models can consume much more compute. DeepSeq R1 has ignited global enthusiasm. It's an excellent innovation. But even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model. Nearly every AI developer is applying R1. Or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques like R1. To scale their model's performance. We now have three scaling laws, as I mentioned earlier. Driving the demand for AI computing. The traditional scaling laws of AI remain intact. Foundation models are being enhanced with multimodality. And pretraining is still growing. But it's no longer enough. We have two additional scaling dimensions. Post-training scaling, where reinforcement learning fine-tuning, model distillation, require orders of magnitude more compute than pretraining alone. Inference time scaling and reasoning where a single query can demand a hundred times more compute. We designed Blackwell for this moment a single platform that can easily transition from pretraining, post-training, and test time scaling. Blackwell's MP4 transformer engine, and NVLink 72 scale-up fabric. And new software technologies let Blackwell process reasoning AI models 25 times faster than Hopper. Blackwell, in all of these configurations, is in full production. Each Grace Blackwell NVLink 72 rack is an engineering marvel. One and a half million components produced across 350 manufacturing sites by nearly a hundred thousand factory operators. AI is advancing at light speed. We're at the beginning of reasoning AI and inference time scaling. But we're just at the start of the age of AI. Multimodal AIs. Enterprise AI, Sovereign AI. And physical AI are right around the corner. We will grow strongly in 2025. Going forward, data centers will dedicate most of CapEx to accelerated computing and AI. Data centers will increasingly become AI factories. And every company will have a either rented or self-operated. I wanna thank all of you for joining us today. Come join us at GTC in a couple of weeks gonna be talking about Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and other new computing networking, reasoning AI, physical AI products. And a whole bunch more. Thank you.\nChrista: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thank you, Stewart. Q3 was another record quarter. We continued to deliver incredible growth. Revenue of $35.1 billion was up 17% sequentially and up 94% year-on-year and, well above our outlook of $32.5 billion. All market platforms posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, fueled by the adoption of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI. Starting with Data Center, another record was achieved in Data Center. Revenue of $30.8 billion, up 17% sequential and up 112% year-on-year. NVIDIA Hopper demand is exceptional and sequentially, NVIDIA H200 sales increased significantly to double-digit billions, the fastest product ramp in our company's history. The H200 delivers up to 2 times faster inference performance and up to 50% improved TCO. Cloud service providers were approximately half of our data center sales with revenue increasing more than 2 times year-on-year. CSPs deployed NVIDIA H200 infrastructure and high-speed networking with installations scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs to grow their business and serve rapidly rising demand for AI training and inference workloads. NVIDIA H200-powered cloud instances are now available from AWS, CoreWeave, and Microsoft Azure with Google Cloud and OCI coming soon. Alongside significant growth from our large CSPs, NVIDIA GPU regional cloud revenue jumped 2 times year-on-year as North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions ramped NVIDIA cloud instances and sovereign cloud buildout. Consumer Internet revenue more than doubled year-on-year as companies scaled their NVIDIA Hopper infrastructure to support next-generation AI models, training, multimodal and agentic AI, deep learning recommender engines, and generative AI inference and content creation workloads. NVIDIA's Ampere and Hopper infrastructures are fueling inference revenue growth for customers. NVIDIA is the largest inference platform in the world. Our large installed base and rich software ecosystem encourage developers to optimize for NVIDIA and deliver continued performance and TCL improvements. Rapid advancements in NVIDIA's software algorithms boosted Hopper inference throughput by an incredible 5 times in one year and cut time to first token by 5 times. Our upcoming release of NVIDIA NIM will boost Hopper Inference performance by an additional 2.4 times. Continuous performance optimizations are a hallmark of NVIDIA and drive increasingly economic returns for the entire NVIDIA installed base. Blackwell is in full production after a successfully executed mass change. We shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including one of the first Blackwell DGX engineering samples to OpenAI. Blackwell is a full stack, full infrastructure, AI data center scale system with customizable configurations needed to address a diverse and growing AI market from x86 to ARM, training to inferencing GPUs, InfiniBand to Ethernet switches, and NVLINK and from liquid-cooled to air-cooled. Every customer is racing to be the first to market. Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners and they are working to bring up their Data Centers. We are integrating Blackwell systems into the diverse Data Center configurations of our customers. Blackwell demand is staggering and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us. Customers are gearing up to deploy Blackwell at scale. Oracle announced the world's first Zettascale AI Cloud computing clusters that can scale to over 131,000 Blackwell GPUs to help enterprises train and deploy some of the most demanding next-generation AI models. Yesterday, Microsoft announced they will be the first CSP to offer in private preview Blackwell-based cloud instances powered by NVIDIA GB200, and Quantum InfiniBand. Last week, Blackwell made its debut on the most recent round of MLPerf Training results, sweeping the per GPU benchmarks and delivering a 2.2 times leap in performance over Hopper. The results also demonstrate our relentless pursuit to drive down the cost of compute. Just 64 Blackwell GPUs are required to run the GPT-3 benchmark compared to 256 H100s or a 4 times reduction in cost. NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with NVLINK Switch enables up to 30 times faster inference performance and a new level of inference scaling throughput and response time that is excellent for running new reasoning inference applications like OpenAI's o1 model. With every new platform shift, a wave of start-ups is created. Hundreds of AI native companies are already delivering AI services with great success. Through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are the headliners and Anthropic, Perplexity, Mistral, Adobe Firefly, Runway, Midjourney, Lightricks, Harvey, Codeium, Cursor, and Bridge are seeing great success, while thousands of AI-native startups are building new services. The next wave of AI are Enterprise AI and Industrial AI. Enterprise AI is in full throttle. NVIDIA AI Enterprise, which includes NVIDIA NeMo and NIM microservices is an operating platform of agentic AI. Industry leaders are using NVIDIA AI to build Co-Pilots and agents. Working with NVIDIA, Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, NetApp, Nutanix, Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow are racing to accelerate development of these applications with the potential for billions of agents to be deployed in the coming years. Consulting leaders like Accenture and Deloitte are taking NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises. Accenture launched a new business group with 30,000 professionals trained on NVIDIA AI technology to help facilitate this global build-out. Additionally, Accenture with over 770,000 employees is leveraging NVIDIA-powered Agentic AI applications internally, including in one case that cuts manual steps in marketing campaigns by 25% to 35%. Nearly 1,000 companies are using NVIDIA NIM and the speed of its uptake is evident in NVIDIA AI Enterprise monetization. We expect NVIDIA AI Enterprise full year revenue to increase over 2 times from last year and our pipeline continues to build. Overall, our software, service, and support revenue is annualizing at $1.5 billion, and we expect to exit this year annualizing at over $2 billion. Industrial AI and robotics are accelerating. This is triggered by breakthroughs in physical AI, foundation models that understand the physical world. Like NVIDIA NeMo for enterprise AI agents, we built NVIDIA Omniverse for developers to build, train, and operate industrial AI and robotics. Some of the largest industrial manufacturers in the world are adopting NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their businesses, automate their workflows, and to achieve new levels of operating efficiency. Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer is using digital twins and industrial AI built on NVIDIA Omniverse to speed the bring up of its Blackwells factories and drive new levels of efficiency. In its Mexico facility alone, Foxconn expects to reduce -- a reduction of over 30% in annual kilowatt-hour usage. From a geographic perspective, our Data Center revenue in China grew sequentially due to shipments of export-compliant copper products to industries. As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains well below levels prior to the onset of export controls. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Our sovereign AI initiatives continue to gather momentum as countries embrace NVIDIA accelerated computing for a new industrial revolution powered by AI. India's leading CSPs include Tata Communications and Yotta Data Services are building AI factories for tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. By year-end, they will have boosted NVIDIA GPU deployments in the country by nearly 10 times. Infosys, TSE, Wipro are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and upskilling nearly 0.5 million developers and consultants to help clients build and run AI agents on our platform. In Japan, SoftBank is building the nation's most powerful AI supercomputer with NVIDIA DGX Blackwell and Quantum InfiniBand. SoftBank is also partnering with NVIDIA to transform the telecommunications network into a distributed AI network with NVIDIA AI Aerial and AI-RAN platform that can process both 5G RAN on AI on CUDA. We are launching the same in the US with T-Mobile. Leaders across Japan, including Fujitsu, NEC and NTT are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and major consulting companies, including EY, Strategy, and Consulting will help bring NVIDIA AI technology to Japan's industries. Networking revenue increased 20% year-on-year. Areas of sequential revenue growth include InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs, and BlueField DPUs. The networking revenue was sequentially down, networking demand is strong and growing and we intend -- anticipate sequential growth in Q4. CSPs and supercomputing centers are using and adopting the NVIDIA InfiniBand platform to power new H200 clusters. NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI revenue increased over 3 times year-on-year and our pipeline continues to build with multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies planning large cluster deployments. Traditional Ethernet was not designed for AI. NVIDIA Spectrum-X uniquely leverages technology previously exclusive to InfiniBand to enable customers to achieve massive scale of their GPU compute. Utilizing Spectrum-X, xAI's Colossus, 100,000 Hopper Supercomputer will experience zero application latency degradation and maintained 95% data throughput versus 60% for traditional Ethernet. Now moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $3.3 billion increased 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. Q3 was a great quarter for gaming with notebook, console, and desktop revenue, all growing sequentially and year-on-year. RTX end-demand was fueled by strong back-to-school sales as consumers continue to choose GeForce RTX GPUs and devices to power gaming, creative, and AI applications. Channel inventory remains healthy and we are gearing up for the holiday season. We began shipping new GeForce RTX AI PCs with up to 321 AI tops from ASUS and MSI with Microsoft's Copilot+ capabilities anticipated in Q4. These machines harness the power of RTX ray tracing and AI technologies to supercharge gaming, photo and video editing, image generation, and coding. This past quarter, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256, the world's first GPU. The transforming computing graphics to igniting the AI revolution, NVIDIA's GPUs have been the driving force behind some of the most consequential technologies of our time. Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $486 million was up 7% sequentially and 17% year-on-year. NVIDIA RTX workstations continue to be the preferred choice to power professional graphics, design, and engineering-related workloads. Additionally, AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver, including autonomous vehicle simulation, generative AI model prototyping for productivity-related use cases, and generative AI, content creation in media and entertainment. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was a record $449 million, up 30% sequentially and up 72% year-on-year. Strong growth was driven by self-driving ramps of NVIDIA Orin and robust end-market demand for NAVs. Volvo Cars has rolling out its fully electric SUV built on NVIDIA Orin and DriveOS. Okay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 74.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 75%, down sequentially, primarily driven by a mix-shift of the H100 systems to more complex and higher cost systems within Data Center. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9% due to higher compute, infrastructure, and engineering development costs for new product introductions. In Q3, we returned $11.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Well, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, which incorporates continued demand for Hopper architecture and the initial ramp of our Blackwell products, while demand is greatly exceed supply, we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to increase. On gaming, although sell-through was strong in Q3, we expect fourth quarter revenue to decline sequentially due to supply constraints. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with several different types of NVIDIA-build chips, multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled Data Centers. Our current focus is on ramping to strong demand, increasing system availability, and providing the optimal mix of configurations to our customer. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low-70s. When fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We are a data center scale AI infrastructure company. Our investments include building data centers for development of our hardware and software stacks and to support new introductions. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5% plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR websites. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference on December 3rd, in Scottsdale. Please join us at CES in Las Vegas, where Jensen will deliver a keynote on January 6th, and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day on January 7th. Our earnings call to discuss results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for February 26th, 2025. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you poll for questions, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess just a question for you on the debate around whether scaling for large language models have stalled. Obviously, we're very early here but would love to hear your thoughts on this front. How are you helping your customers as they work through these issues? And then obviously, part of the context here as we're discussing clusters that have yet to benefit from Blackwell. So is this driving even greater demand for Blackwell? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it's continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is that it's not enough that we've now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling. And one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is Strawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling, what's called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces and it considers approaches like chain of thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to reflect and so on and so forth and it's intuitively, it's a little bit like us doing thinking in our head before we answer a question. And so we now have three ways of scaling and we're seeing all three ways of scaling. And as a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great. You see now that at the tail-end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells. And so that kind of gives you a sense of where the industry is moving with respect to pre-training scaling, post-training scaling, and then now very importantly inference time scaling. And so the demand is really great for all of those reasons. But remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to scale out for our company. We are the largest inference platform in the world today because our installed base is so large and everything that was trained on Amperes and Hoppers inference incredibly on Amperes and Hoppers. And as we move to Blackwells for training foundation models, it leads behind it a large installed base of extraordinary infrastructure for inference. And so we're seeing inference demand go up. We're seeing inference time scaling go up. We see the number of AI-native companies continue to grow. And of course, we're starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI really is the latest rage. And so we're seeing a lot of demand coming from a lot of different places.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year. There were some reports over the weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the roadmap you presented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to [Ruben] (ph) in 2026. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that. So if you can sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B, on supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's causing this? Or is it specifically [HBM] (ph)? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes, thanks. Thanks. So let's see, back to the first question. Blackwell production is in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so the supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year. It is the case that demand exceeds our supply and that's expected as we're in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking and of course, one of the really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the structure of the physical world. And so Blackwell demand is very strong. Our execution is on -- is going well. And there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the world. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave, I think you saw systems from Oracle stood up. You have systems from Microsoft and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You have systems that are at Google. And so all of these CSPs are racing to be first. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather complicated. And the reason for that is because although we build full stack and full infrastructure, we disaggregate all of the -- this AI supercomputer and we integrate it into all of the custom data centers in architectures around the world. That integration process is something we've done several generations now. We're very good at it, but still, there's still a lot of engineering that happens at this point. But as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape. And as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With respect to the supply chain, all right, there are seven different chips, seven custom chips that we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The Blackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72 or NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72 we have x86 or Grace and the integration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is nothing short of a miracle. And so the component supply chain necessary to ramp at the scale you have to go back and take a look at how much Blackwell we shipped last quarter, which was zero. And in terms of how much Blackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in billions, the ramp is incredible. And so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply chain. And we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and Amphenol, the connector company, incredible company, Vertiv and SK Hynix and Micron Spill, Amkor and KYEC and there's Foxconn and the many the factories that they've built and Quanta and Wiwynn and gosh, Dell and HP and Super Micro, Lenovo and the number of companies is just really quite incredible, Quanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping up of Blackwell, which I really appreciate. And so anyways, I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point. And then lastly, your question about our execution of our roadmap. We're on an annual roadmap and we're expecting to continue to execute on our annual roadmap. And by doing so, we increase the performance, of course, of our platform, but it's also really important to realize that when we're able to increase performance and do so at X factors at a time, we're reducing the cost of training, we're reducing the cost of inferencing, we're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible. But the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a data center of some fixed size and a data center always is of some fixed size. It could be, of course, 10s of megawatts in the past and now it's most data centers are now 100 megawatts to several 100 megawatts and we're planning on gigawatt data centers, it doesn't really matter how large the data centers are, the power is limited. And when you're in the power-limited data center, the best -- the highest performance per watt translates directly into the highest revenues for our partners. And so on the one hand, our annual roadmap reduces cost, but on the other hand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so that annual rhythm is really important to us and we have every intentions of continuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is going to ramp this year. I know, Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell being better than I think you had said several billions of dollars in January. It sounds like you're going to do more than that. But I think in recent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the April quarter. So I guess I had two questions. First of all, is that still the right way to think about it that Blackwell will crossover Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about Blackwell bringing down gross margin to the low-70s as it ramps. So I guess if April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross margin? So you're going to be kind of in the low-70s as soon as April. I'm just wondering if you can sort of shape that for us. Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Colette, why don't you start?\nColette Kress: Sure. Let me first start with your question, Tim. Thank you regarding our gross margins, and we discussed our gross margins as we are ramping Blackwell in the very beginning and the many different configurations, the many different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus on making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand that up. We will start growing into our gross margins, but we do believe those will be in the low 70s in that first part of the ramp. So you're correct, as you look at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our gross margins and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of that ramp.\nJensen Huang: Hopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several quarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next quarter than this. And we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that than our first quarter. And so that kind of puts it in perspective. We are really at the beginnings of two fundamental shifts in computing that is really quite significant. The first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that creates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no companies who are not going to do machine learning. And so machine learning is also what enables generative AI. And so on the one hand, the first thing that's happening is a trillion dollars’ worth of computing systems and data centers around the world is now being modernized for machine learning. On the other hand, secondarily, I guess, is that, that on top of these systems are going to be -- we're going to be creating a new type of capability called AI. And when we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something. Just like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And today, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory. And so we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call it an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is. It's unlike a data center of the past. And so these two fundamental trends are really just beginning. And so we expect this to happen this growth -- this modernization and the creation of a new industry to go on for several years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Colette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think NVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar 2025? Just wanted to clarify that. And then, Jensen my main question historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they have inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we get to that phase, or is it just too premature to discuss that because you're just the start of Blackwell? So how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of satisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar 2026? Just how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically, right, the periods of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular hardware deployment?\nColette Kress: Okay. Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question regarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year? And yes, I think it is reasonable assumption or a goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes. But yes, it is definitely possible.\nJensen Huang: The way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize a trillion dollars with the data centers. Those -- if you look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built for a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's just not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's CapEx, if they're ready to build a data center tomorrow, they ought to build it for a future of machine-learning and generative AI. Because they have plenty of old data centers. And so what's going to happen over the course of next X number of years, and let's assume that over the course of four years, the world's data centers could be modernized as we grow into IT. As you know, IT continues to grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. And let's say by 2030, the world's data centers for computing is, call it a couple of trillion dollars. And we have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center from coding to machine learning. That's number one. The second part of it is generative AI, and we're now producing a new type of capability that world has never known, a new market segment that the world has never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything. It's something that's completely brand new. It's in a lot of ways as when the iPhone came, it was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing anything. And so we're going to see more and more companies like that. And they're going to create and generate out of their services, essentially intelligence. Some of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it would be basic intelligence, like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal intelligence like Harvey. Digital marketing intelligence like [Reuters] (ph), so on and so forth. And the number of these companies, these -- what are they call AI-native companies are just in hundreds and almost every platform shift there was -- there were Internet companies as you recall, there were cloud-first companies. They were mobile-first companies and now they're AI natives. And so these companies are being created because people see that there's a platform shift and there's a brand new opportunity to do something completely new. And so my sense is that we're going to continue to build out to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one. And then number two, create these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the production of artificial intelligence.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I had a clarification and a question for you. The clarification, just when you say low-70s gross margins, is 73.5 count as low-70s, or do you have something else in mind? And for my question, you're guiding total revenues and so I mean, total Data Center revenues in the next quarter must be up quote-unquote several billion dollars, but it sounds like Blackwell now should be up more than that. But you also said Hopper was still strong. So like is Hopper down sequentially next quarter? And if it is like why? Is it because of the supply constraints? Is China has been pretty strong is China is kind of rolling off a bit into Q4. So any color you can give us on sort of the Blackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nColette Kress: So first starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross margin and defined low. Low, of course, is below the mid, and let's say we might be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%, we're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well. We're just going to have to see how it comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year. So we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our Hopper doing. We have seen substantial growth for our H200, not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that up. It is an amazing product and it's the fastest-growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure, that is across-the-board in terms of all of our different configurations and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks are also at the same time looking to build out their Blackwell. So we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4. But yes, is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4, it's possible, but we'll just have to see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the ramifications of longer scaling inference projects. But you've also talked about the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age that you could use some of the Hopper latent chips for inference. So I guess, do you expect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12-month time frame, and just generally your thoughts there?\nJensen Huang: Our hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference. And that's when AI has really succeeded, right. It's when every single company is doing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course and coding, of course. And so we hope that every company is doing inference 24/7. And that there will be a whole bunch of AI native startups, thousands of AI native startups that are generating tokens and generating AI and every aspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or when you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens. And every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of tokens. One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google application that came out. I use the living daylights out of it just because it's fun. And I put every PDF, every archive paper into it just to listen to it as well as scanning through it. And so I think -- that's the goal is to train these models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI if you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI, just those large language models understand the human language and how we the thinking process, if you will. Physical AI understands the physical world and it understands the meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not and what could happen and what won't and not only does it understand but it can predict and roll out a short future. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and robotics. And so that's fired up so many AI-native companies and robotics companies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about. And it's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is so that we can enable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from synthetic data generation and reinforcement learning physics feedback instead of human feedback is now physics feedback. To have these capabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI. And so that the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference and we're starting to see that growth happening. So I'm super excited about that. Now let me just say one more thing. Inference is super hard. And the reason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be high on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost could be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low. And computers that are high throughput as well as low latency is incredibly hard to build. And these applications have long context lengths because they want to understand, they want to be able to inference within understanding the context of what's -- what they're being asked to do. And so the context length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models are getting larger, they're multimodality. Just the number of dimensions that inference is innovating is incredible. And this innovation rate is what makes NVIDIA's architecture so great because our ecosystem is fantastic. Everybody knows that if they innovate on top of CUDA on top of NVIDIA's architecture, they can innovate more quickly and they know that everything should work. And if something were to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours. And so that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time, having a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on a NVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every single data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that capability is really quite phenomenal.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you as we kind of focus on the Blackwell cycle and think about the data center business. When I look at the results this last quarter, Colette, you mentioned that obviously, the networking business was down about 15% sequentially, but then your comments were that you were seeing very strong demand. You mentioned also that you had multiple cloud CSP design wins for these large-scale clusters. So I'm curious if you could unpack what's going on in the networking business and where maybe you've seen some constraints and just your confidence in the pace of Spectrum-X progressing to that multiple billions of dollars that you previously had talked about. Thank you.\nColette Kress: Let's first start with the networking. The growth year-over-year is tremendous and our focus since the beginning of our acquisition of Mellanox has really been about building together the work that we do in terms of -- in the Data Center. The networking is such a critical part of that. Our ability to sell our networking with many of our systems that we are doing in data center is continuing to grow and do quite well. So this quarter is just a slight dip down and we're going to be right back up in terms of growing. They're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking but also the networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems that we are providing them to.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik of Citi. Your line is open.\nAtif Malik: Thank you for taking my question. I have two quick ones for Collette. Colette, on the last earnings call, you mentioned that sovereign demand is in low double-digit billions. Can you provide an update on that? And then can you explain the supply-constrained situation in gaming? Is that because you're shifting your supply towards data center?\nColette Kress: So first starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of growth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI and building models in the individual countries around the world. And we see a lot of them and we talked about a lot of them in the call today and the work that they are doing. So our sovereign AI and our pipeline going forward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these foundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and working in terms of the enterprises within those countries. And I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you may see with our regional clouds that are being stored up and/or those that are focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI. This is areas where this is growing not only in terms of in Europe, but you're also seeing this in terms of growth in terms of -- in the Asia-Pac as well. Let me flip to your second question that you asked regarding gaming. So our gaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can ramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply, given what we saw selling through was moving quite fast. Now the challenge that we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the market for this quarter. Not to worry, I think we'll be back on track with more suppliers we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We're just going to be tight for this quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Melius Research. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Yes. Hi. Thanks a lot for the question. I wanted to ask Colette and Jensen with regard to sequential growth. So very strong sequential growth this quarter and you're guiding to about 7%. Do your comments on Blackwell imply that we reaccelerate from there as you get more supply? Just in the first half, it would seem that there would be some catch-ups. So I was wondering how prescriptive you could be there. And then, Jensen, just overall, with the change in administration that's going to take place here in the US and the China situation, have you gotten any sense, or any conversations about tariffs, or anything with regard to your China business? Any sense of what may or may not go on? It's probably too early, but wondering if you had any thoughts there. Thanks so much.\nJensen Huang: We guide one quarter at a time.\nColette Kress: We are working right now on the quarter that we're in and building what we need to ship in terms of Blackwell. We have every supplier on the planet working seamlessly with us to do that. And once we get to next quarter, we'll help you understand in terms of that ramp that we'll see to the next quarter and after that.\nJensen Huang: Whatever the new administration decides, we will of course support the administration. And that's our -- the highest mandate. And then after that, do the best we can. And just as we always do. And so we have to simultaneously and we will comply with any regulation that comes along fully and support our customers to the best of our abilities and compete in the marketplace. We'll do all of these three things simultaneously.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research. Your line is open.\nPierre Ferragu: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in your comments you have the pre-trainings, the actual language models and you have reinforcement learning that becomes more and more important in training and in inference as well. And then you have inference itself. And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level typical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem like maybe one of your clients or one of the large models that are out there. Today, how much of the compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pre-training, how much for the reinforcement, and how much into inference today? Do you have any sense for how it's splitting and where the growth is the most important as well?\nJensen Huang: Well, today it's vastly in pre-training a foundation model because as you know, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online and whatever you could do in pre-training and post-training, you would try to do so that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone. However, there are only so many things that you could do priority. And so you'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in-context thinking and a reflection. And so I think that the fact that all three are scaling is actually very sensible based on what we are. And in the area of foundation model, now we have multimodality foundation models and the amount of petabytes of video that these foundation models are going to be trained on is incredible. And so my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be scaling pre-training, post-training as well as inference time scaling and which is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute and we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the performance by X factors at a time so that we can continue to drive down the cost and continue to increase their revenues and get the AI revolution going. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thank you. The tremendous growth in our business is being fueled by two fundamental trends that are driving global adoption of NVIDIA computing. First, the computing stack is undergoing a reinvention, a platform shift from coding to machine learning. From executing code on CPUs to processing neural networks on GPUs. The trillion-dollar installed base of traditional Data center infrastructure is being rebuilt for Software 2.0, which applies machine learning to produce AI. Second, the age of AI is in full steam. Generative AI is not just a new software capability, but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence, a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-trillion dollar AI industry. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell, which is now in full production are incredible for several reasons. There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago. The computing scale of pre-training and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI-native start-ups than ever and the number of successful inference services is rising. And with the introduction of ChatGPT o1, OpenAI o1, a new scaling law called test time scaling has emerged. All of these consume a great deal of computing. AI is transforming every industry, company, and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Over time, AI coworkers will assist employees in performing their jobs faster and better. Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI. Driving new training infrastructure demand as researchers train world foundation models on petabytes of video and Omniverse synthetically generated data. The age of robotics is coming. Countries across the world recognize the fundamental AI trends we are seeing and have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI infrastructure. The age of AI is upon us and it's large and diverse.

With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thank you, Stewart. Q3 was another record quarter. We continued to deliver incredible growth. Revenue of $35.1 billion was up 17% sequentially and up 94% year-on-year and, well above our outlook of $32.5 billion. All market platforms posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, fueled by the adoption of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI. Starting with Data Center, another record was achieved in Data Center. Revenue of $30.8 billion, up 17% sequential and up 112% year-on-year. NVIDIA Hopper demand is exceptional and sequentially, NVIDIA H200 sales increased significantly to double-digit billions, the fastest product ramp in our company's history. The H200 delivers up to 2 times faster inference performance and up to 50% improved TCO. Cloud service providers were approximately half of our data center sales with revenue increasing more than 2 times year-on-year. CSPs deployed NVIDIA H200 infrastructure and high-speed networking with installations scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs to grow their business and serve rapidly rising demand for AI training and inference workloads. NVIDIA H200-powered cloud instances are now available from AWS, CoreWeave, and Microsoft Azure with Google Cloud and OCI coming soon. Alongside significant growth from our large CSPs, NVIDIA GPU regional cloud revenue jumped 2 times year-on-year as North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions ramped NVIDIA cloud instances and sovereign cloud buildout. Consumer Internet revenue more than doubled year-on-year as companies scaled their NVIDIA Hopper infrastructure to support next-generation AI models, training, multimodal and agentic AI, deep learning recommender engines, and generative AI inference and content creation workloads. NVIDIA's Ampere and Hopper infrastructures are fueling inference revenue growth for customers. NVIDIA is the largest inference platform in the world. Our large installed base and rich software ecosystem encourage developers to optimize for NVIDIA and deliver continued performance and TCL improvements. Rapid advancements in NVIDIA's software algorithms boosted Hopper inference throughput by an incredible 5 times in one year and cut time to first token by 5 times. Our upcoming release of NVIDIA NIM will boost Hopper Inference performance by an additional 2.4 times. Continuous performance optimizations are a hallmark of NVIDIA and drive increasingly economic returns for the entire NVIDIA installed base. Blackwell is in full production after a successfully executed mass change. We shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including one of the first Blackwell DGX engineering samples to OpenAI. Blackwell is a full stack, full infrastructure, AI data center scale system with customizable configurations needed to address a diverse and growing AI market from x86 to ARM, training to inferencing GPUs, InfiniBand to Ethernet switches, and NVLINK and from liquid-cooled to air-cooled. Every customer is racing to be the first to market. Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners and they are working to bring up their Data Centers. We are integrating Blackwell systems into the diverse Data Center configurations of our customers. Blackwell demand is staggering and we are racing to scale supply to meet the incredible demand customers are placing on us. Customers are gearing up to deploy Blackwell at scale. Oracle announced the world's first Zettascale AI Cloud computing clusters that can scale to over 131,000 Blackwell GPUs to help enterprises train and deploy some of the most demanding next-generation AI models. Yesterday, Microsoft announced they will be the first CSP to offer in private preview Blackwell-based cloud instances powered by NVIDIA GB200, and Quantum InfiniBand. Last week, Blackwell made its debut on the most recent round of MLPerf Training results, sweeping the per GPU benchmarks and delivering a 2.2 times leap in performance over Hopper. The results also demonstrate our relentless pursuit to drive down the cost of compute. Just 64 Blackwell GPUs are required to run the GPT-3 benchmark compared to 256 H100s or a 4 times reduction in cost. NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with NVLINK Switch enables up to 30 times faster inference performance and a new level of inference scaling throughput and response time that is excellent for running new reasoning inference applications like OpenAI's o1 model. With every new platform shift, a wave of start-ups is created. Hundreds of AI native companies are already delivering AI services with great success. Through Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI are the headliners and Anthropic, Perplexity, Mistral, Adobe Firefly, Runway, Midjourney, Lightricks, Harvey, Codeium, Cursor, and Bridge are seeing great success, while thousands of AI-native startups are building new services. The next wave of AI are Enterprise AI and Industrial AI. Enterprise AI is in full throttle. NVIDIA AI Enterprise, which includes NVIDIA NeMo and NIM microservices is an operating platform of agentic AI. Industry leaders are using NVIDIA AI to build Co-Pilots and agents. Working with NVIDIA, Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, NetApp, Nutanix, Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow are racing to accelerate development of these applications with the potential for billions of agents to be deployed in the coming years. Consulting leaders like Accenture and Deloitte are taking NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises. Accenture launched a new business group with 30,000 professionals trained on NVIDIA AI technology to help facilitate this global build-out. Additionally, Accenture with over 770,000 employees is leveraging NVIDIA-powered Agentic AI applications internally, including in one case that cuts manual steps in marketing campaigns by 25% to 35%. Nearly 1,000 companies are using NVIDIA NIM and the speed of its uptake is evident in NVIDIA AI Enterprise monetization. We expect NVIDIA AI Enterprise full year revenue to increase over 2 times from last year and our pipeline continues to build. Overall, our software, service, and support revenue is annualizing at $1.5 billion, and we expect to exit this year annualizing at over $2 billion. Industrial AI and robotics are accelerating. This is triggered by breakthroughs in physical AI, foundation models that understand the physical world. Like NVIDIA NeMo for enterprise AI agents, we built NVIDIA Omniverse for developers to build, train, and operate industrial AI and robotics. Some of the largest industrial manufacturers in the world are adopting NVIDIA Omniverse to accelerate their businesses, automate their workflows, and to achieve new levels of operating efficiency. Foxconn, the world's largest electronics manufacturer is using digital twins and industrial AI built on NVIDIA Omniverse to speed the bring up of its Blackwells factories and drive new levels of efficiency. In its Mexico facility alone, Foxconn expects to reduce -- a reduction of over 30% in annual kilowatt-hour usage. From a geographic perspective, our Data Center revenue in China grew sequentially due to shipments of export-compliant copper products to industries. As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains well below levels prior to the onset of export controls. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. Our sovereign AI initiatives continue to gather momentum as countries embrace NVIDIA accelerated computing for a new industrial revolution powered by AI. India's leading CSPs include Tata Communications and Yotta Data Services are building AI factories for tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. By year-end, they will have boosted NVIDIA GPU deployments in the country by nearly 10 times. Infosys, TSE, Wipro are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and upskilling nearly 0.5 million developers and consultants to help clients build and run AI agents on our platform. In Japan, SoftBank is building the nation's most powerful AI supercomputer with NVIDIA DGX Blackwell and Quantum InfiniBand. SoftBank is also partnering with NVIDIA to transform the telecommunications network into a distributed AI network with NVIDIA AI Aerial and AI-RAN platform that can process both 5G RAN on AI on CUDA. We are launching the same in the US with T-Mobile. Leaders across Japan, including Fujitsu, NEC and NTT are adopting NVIDIA AI Enterprise and major consulting companies, including EY, Strategy, and Consulting will help bring NVIDIA AI technology to Japan's industries. Networking revenue increased 20% year-on-year. Areas of sequential revenue growth include InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, SmartNICs, and BlueField DPUs. The networking revenue was sequentially down, networking demand is strong and growing and we intend -- anticipate sequential growth in Q4. CSPs and supercomputing centers are using and adopting the NVIDIA InfiniBand platform to power new H200 clusters. NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet for AI revenue increased over 3 times year-on-year and our pipeline continues to build with multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies planning large cluster deployments. Traditional Ethernet was not designed for AI. NVIDIA Spectrum-X uniquely leverages technology previously exclusive to InfiniBand to enable customers to achieve massive scale of their GPU compute. Utilizing Spectrum-X, xAI's Colossus, 100,000 Hopper Supercomputer will experience zero application latency degradation and maintained 95% data throughput versus 60% for traditional Ethernet. Now moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $3.3 billion increased 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. Q3 was a great quarter for gaming with notebook, console, and desktop revenue, all growing sequentially and year-on-year. RTX end-demand was fueled by strong back-to-school sales as consumers continue to choose GeForce RTX GPUs and devices to power gaming, creative, and AI applications. Channel inventory remains healthy and we are gearing up for the holiday season. We began shipping new GeForce RTX AI PCs with up to 321 AI tops from ASUS and MSI with Microsoft's Copilot+ capabilities anticipated in Q4. These machines harness the power of RTX ray tracing and AI technologies to supercharge gaming, photo and video editing, image generation, and coding. This past quarter, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GeForce 256, the world's first GPU. The transforming computing graphics to igniting the AI revolution, NVIDIA's GPUs have been the driving force behind some of the most consequential technologies of our time. Moving to ProViz. Revenue of $486 million was up 7% sequentially and 17% year-on-year. NVIDIA RTX workstations continue to be the preferred choice to power professional graphics, design, and engineering-related workloads. Additionally, AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver, including autonomous vehicle simulation, generative AI model prototyping for productivity-related use cases, and generative AI, content creation in media and entertainment. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was a record $449 million, up 30% sequentially and up 72% year-on-year. Strong growth was driven by self-driving ramps of NVIDIA Orin and robust end-market demand for NAVs. Volvo Cars has rolling out its fully electric SUV built on NVIDIA Orin and DriveOS. Okay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 74.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 75%, down sequentially, primarily driven by a mix-shift of the H100 systems to more complex and higher cost systems within Data Center. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9% due to higher compute, infrastructure, and engineering development costs for new product introductions. In Q3, we returned $11.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Well, let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, which incorporates continued demand for Hopper architecture and the initial ramp of our Blackwell products, while demand is greatly exceed supply, we are on track to exceed our previous Blackwell revenue estimate of several billion dollars as our visibility into supply continues to increase. On gaming, although sell-through was strong in Q3, we expect fourth quarter revenue to decline sequentially due to supply constraints. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 73% and 73.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. Blackwell is a customizable AI infrastructure with several different types of NVIDIA-build chips, multiple networking options, and for air and liquid-cooled Data Centers. Our current focus is on ramping to strong demand, increasing system availability, and providing the optimal mix of configurations to our customer. As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low-70s. When fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We are a data center scale AI infrastructure company. Our investments include building data centers for development of our hardware and software stacks and to support new introductions. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $400 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5% plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR websites. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference on December 3rd, in Scottsdale. Please join us at CES in Las Vegas, where Jensen will deliver a keynote on January 6th, and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day on January 7th. Our earnings call to discuss results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for February 26th, 2025. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you poll for questions, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess just a question for you on the debate around whether scaling for large language models have stalled. Obviously, we're very early here but would love to hear your thoughts on this front. How are you helping your customers as they work through these issues? And then obviously, part of the context here as we're discussing clusters that have yet to benefit from Blackwell. So is this driving even greater demand for Blackwell? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it's continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is that it's not enough that we've now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling. And one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is Strawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling, what's called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces and it considers approaches like chain of thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to reflect and so on and so forth and it's intuitively, it's a little bit like us doing thinking in our head before we answer a question. And so we now have three ways of scaling and we're seeing all three ways of scaling. And as a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great. You see now that at the tail-end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells. And so that kind of gives you a sense of where the industry is moving with respect to pre-training scaling, post-training scaling, and then now very importantly inference time scaling. And so the demand is really great for all of those reasons. But remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to scale out for our company. We are the largest inference platform in the world today because our installed base is so large and everything that was trained on Amperes and Hoppers inference incredibly on Amperes and Hoppers. And as we move to Blackwells for training foundation models, it leads behind it a large installed base of extraordinary infrastructure for inference. And so we're seeing inference demand go up. We're seeing inference time scaling go up. We see the number of AI-native companies continue to grow. And of course, we're starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI really is the latest rage. And so we're seeing a lot of demand coming from a lot of different places.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year. There were some reports over the weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the roadmap you presented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to [Ruben] (ph) in 2026. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that. So if you can sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B, on supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's causing this? Or is it specifically [HBM] (ph)? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening? Any sort of color on that would be super helpful as well. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes, thanks. Thanks. So let's see, back to the first question. Blackwell production is in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so the supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year. It is the case that demand exceeds our supply and that's expected as we're in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking and of course, one of the really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the structure of the physical world. And so Blackwell demand is very strong. Our execution is on -- is going well. And there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the world. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave, I think you saw systems from Oracle stood up. You have systems from Microsoft and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You have systems that are at Google. And so all of these CSPs are racing to be first. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather complicated. And the reason for that is because although we build full stack and full infrastructure, we disaggregate all of the -- this AI supercomputer and we integrate it into all of the custom data centers in architectures around the world. That integration process is something we've done several generations now. We're very good at it, but still, there's still a lot of engineering that happens at this point. But as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape. And as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With respect to the supply chain, all right, there are seven different chips, seven custom chips that we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The Blackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72 or NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72 we have x86 or Grace and the integration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is nothing short of a miracle. And so the component supply chain necessary to ramp at the scale you have to go back and take a look at how much Blackwell we shipped last quarter, which was zero. And in terms of how much Blackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in billions, the ramp is incredible. And so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply chain. And we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and Amphenol, the connector company, incredible company, Vertiv and SK Hynix and Micron Spill, Amkor and KYEC and there's Foxconn and the many the factories that they've built and Quanta and Wiwynn and gosh, Dell and HP and Super Micro, Lenovo and the number of companies is just really quite incredible, Quanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping up of Blackwell, which I really appreciate. And so anyways, I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point. And then lastly, your question about our execution of our roadmap. We're on an annual roadmap and we're expecting to continue to execute on our annual roadmap. And by doing so, we increase the performance, of course, of our platform, but it's also really important to realize that when we're able to increase performance and do so at X factors at a time, we're reducing the cost of training, we're reducing the cost of inferencing, we're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible. But the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a data center of some fixed size and a data center always is of some fixed size. It could be, of course, 10s of megawatts in the past and now it's most data centers are now 100 megawatts to several 100 megawatts and we're planning on gigawatt data centers, it doesn't really matter how large the data centers are, the power is limited. And when you're in the power-limited data center, the best -- the highest performance per watt translates directly into the highest revenues for our partners. And so on the one hand, our annual roadmap reduces cost, but on the other hand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so that annual rhythm is really important to us and we have every intentions of continuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is going to ramp this year. I know, Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell being better than I think you had said several billions of dollars in January. It sounds like you're going to do more than that. But I think in recent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the April quarter. So I guess I had two questions. First of all, is that still the right way to think about it that Blackwell will crossover Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about Blackwell bringing down gross margin to the low-70s as it ramps. So I guess if April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross margin? So you're going to be kind of in the low-70s as soon as April. I'm just wondering if you can sort of shape that for us. Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Colette, why don't you start?\nColette Kress: Sure. Let me first start with your question, Tim. Thank you regarding our gross margins, and we discussed our gross margins as we are ramping Blackwell in the very beginning and the many different configurations, the many different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus on making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand that up. We will start growing into our gross margins, but we do believe those will be in the low 70s in that first part of the ramp. So you're correct, as you look at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our gross margins and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of that ramp.\nJensen Huang: Hopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several quarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next quarter than this. And we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that than our first quarter. And so that kind of puts it in perspective. We are really at the beginnings of two fundamental shifts in computing that is really quite significant. The first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that creates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no companies who are not going to do machine learning. And so machine learning is also what enables generative AI. And so on the one hand, the first thing that's happening is a trillion dollars’ worth of computing systems and data centers around the world is now being modernized for machine learning. On the other hand, secondarily, I guess, is that, that on top of these systems are going to be -- we're going to be creating a new type of capability called AI. And when we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something. Just like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And today, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory. And so we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call it an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is. It's unlike a data center of the past. And so these two fundamental trends are really just beginning. And so we expect this to happen this growth -- this modernization and the creation of a new industry to go on for several years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Colette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think NVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar 2025? Just wanted to clarify that. And then, Jensen my main question historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they have inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we get to that phase, or is it just too premature to discuss that because you're just the start of Blackwell? So how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of satisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar 2026? Just how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically, right, the periods of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular hardware deployment?\nColette Kress: Okay. Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question regarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year? And yes, I think it is reasonable assumption or a goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes. But yes, it is definitely possible.\nJensen Huang: The way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize a trillion dollars with the data centers. Those -- if you look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built for a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's just not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's CapEx, if they're ready to build a data center tomorrow, they ought to build it for a future of machine-learning and generative AI. Because they have plenty of old data centers. And so what's going to happen over the course of next X number of years, and let's assume that over the course of four years, the world's data centers could be modernized as we grow into IT. As you know, IT continues to grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. And let's say by 2030, the world's data centers for computing is, call it a couple of trillion dollars. And we have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center from coding to machine learning. That's number one. The second part of it is generative AI, and we're now producing a new type of capability that world has never known, a new market segment that the world has never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything. It's something that's completely brand new. It's in a lot of ways as when the iPhone came, it was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing anything. And so we're going to see more and more companies like that. And they're going to create and generate out of their services, essentially intelligence. Some of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it would be basic intelligence, like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal intelligence like Harvey. Digital marketing intelligence like [Reuters] (ph), so on and so forth. And the number of these companies, these -- what are they call AI-native companies are just in hundreds and almost every platform shift there was -- there were Internet companies as you recall, there were cloud-first companies. They were mobile-first companies and now they're AI natives. And so these companies are being created because people see that there's a platform shift and there's a brand new opportunity to do something completely new. And so my sense is that we're going to continue to build out to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one. And then number two, create these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the production of artificial intelligence.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I had a clarification and a question for you. The clarification, just when you say low-70s gross margins, is 73.5 count as low-70s, or do you have something else in mind? And for my question, you're guiding total revenues and so I mean, total Data Center revenues in the next quarter must be up quote-unquote several billion dollars, but it sounds like Blackwell now should be up more than that. But you also said Hopper was still strong. So like is Hopper down sequentially next quarter? And if it is like why? Is it because of the supply constraints? Is China has been pretty strong is China is kind of rolling off a bit into Q4. So any color you can give us on sort of the Blackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be really helpful. Thank you.\nColette Kress: So first starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross margin and defined low. Low, of course, is below the mid, and let's say we might be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%, we're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well. We're just going to have to see how it comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year. So we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our Hopper doing. We have seen substantial growth for our H200, not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that up. It is an amazing product and it's the fastest-growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure, that is across-the-board in terms of all of our different configurations and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks are also at the same time looking to build out their Blackwell. So we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4. But yes, is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4, it's possible, but we'll just have to see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the ramifications of longer scaling inference projects. But you've also talked about the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age that you could use some of the Hopper latent chips for inference. So I guess, do you expect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12-month time frame, and just generally your thoughts there?\nJensen Huang: Our hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference. And that's when AI has really succeeded, right. It's when every single company is doing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course and coding, of course. And so we hope that every company is doing inference 24/7. And that there will be a whole bunch of AI native startups, thousands of AI native startups that are generating tokens and generating AI and every aspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or when you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens. And every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of tokens. One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google application that came out. I use the living daylights out of it just because it's fun. And I put every PDF, every archive paper into it just to listen to it as well as scanning through it. And so I think -- that's the goal is to train these models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI if you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI, just those large language models understand the human language and how we the thinking process, if you will. Physical AI understands the physical world and it understands the meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not and what could happen and what won't and not only does it understand but it can predict and roll out a short future. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and robotics. And so that's fired up so many AI-native companies and robotics companies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about. And it's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is so that we can enable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from synthetic data generation and reinforcement learning physics feedback instead of human feedback is now physics feedback. To have these capabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI. And so that the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference and we're starting to see that growth happening. So I'm super excited about that. Now let me just say one more thing. Inference is super hard. And the reason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be high on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost could be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low. And computers that are high throughput as well as low latency is incredibly hard to build. And these applications have long context lengths because they want to understand, they want to be able to inference within understanding the context of what's -- what they're being asked to do. And so the context length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models are getting larger, they're multimodality. Just the number of dimensions that inference is innovating is incredible. And this innovation rate is what makes NVIDIA's architecture so great because our ecosystem is fantastic. Everybody knows that if they innovate on top of CUDA on top of NVIDIA's architecture, they can innovate more quickly and they know that everything should work. And if something were to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours. And so that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time, having a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on a NVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every single data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that capability is really quite phenomenal.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you as we kind of focus on the Blackwell cycle and think about the data center business. When I look at the results this last quarter, Colette, you mentioned that obviously, the networking business was down about 15% sequentially, but then your comments were that you were seeing very strong demand. You mentioned also that you had multiple cloud CSP design wins for these large-scale clusters. So I'm curious if you could unpack what's going on in the networking business and where maybe you've seen some constraints and just your confidence in the pace of Spectrum-X progressing to that multiple billions of dollars that you previously had talked about. Thank you.\nColette Kress: Let's first start with the networking. The growth year-over-year is tremendous and our focus since the beginning of our acquisition of Mellanox has really been about building together the work that we do in terms of -- in the Data Center. The networking is such a critical part of that. Our ability to sell our networking with many of our systems that we are doing in data center is continuing to grow and do quite well. So this quarter is just a slight dip down and we're going to be right back up in terms of growing. They're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking but also the networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems that we are providing them to.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik of Citi. Your line is open.\nAtif Malik: Thank you for taking my question. I have two quick ones for Collette. Colette, on the last earnings call, you mentioned that sovereign demand is in low double-digit billions. Can you provide an update on that? And then can you explain the supply-constrained situation in gaming? Is that because you're shifting your supply towards data center?\nColette Kress: So first starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of growth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI and building models in the individual countries around the world. And we see a lot of them and we talked about a lot of them in the call today and the work that they are doing. So our sovereign AI and our pipeline going forward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these foundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and working in terms of the enterprises within those countries. And I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you may see with our regional clouds that are being stored up and/or those that are focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI. This is areas where this is growing not only in terms of in Europe, but you're also seeing this in terms of growth in terms of -- in the Asia-Pac as well. Let me flip to your second question that you asked regarding gaming. So our gaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can ramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply, given what we saw selling through was moving quite fast. Now the challenge that we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the market for this quarter. Not to worry, I think we'll be back on track with more suppliers we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We're just going to be tight for this quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Melius Research. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Yes. Hi. Thanks a lot for the question. I wanted to ask Colette and Jensen with regard to sequential growth. So very strong sequential growth this quarter and you're guiding to about 7%. Do your comments on Blackwell imply that we reaccelerate from there as you get more supply? Just in the first half, it would seem that there would be some catch-ups. So I was wondering how prescriptive you could be there. And then, Jensen, just overall, with the change in administration that's going to take place here in the US and the China situation, have you gotten any sense, or any conversations about tariffs, or anything with regard to your China business? Any sense of what may or may not go on? It's probably too early, but wondering if you had any thoughts there. Thanks so much.\nJensen Huang: We guide one quarter at a time.\nColette Kress: We are working right now on the quarter that we're in and building what we need to ship in terms of Blackwell. We have every supplier on the planet working seamlessly with us to do that. And once we get to next quarter, we'll help you understand in terms of that ramp that we'll see to the next quarter and after that.\nJensen Huang: Whatever the new administration decides, we will of course support the administration. And that's our -- the highest mandate. And then after that, do the best we can. And just as we always do. And so we have to simultaneously and we will comply with any regulation that comes along fully and support our customers to the best of our abilities and compete in the marketplace. We'll do all of these three things simultaneously.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research. Your line is open.\nPierre Ferragu: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in your comments you have the pre-trainings, the actual language models and you have reinforcement learning that becomes more and more important in training and in inference as well. And then you have inference itself. And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level typical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem like maybe one of your clients or one of the large models that are out there. Today, how much of the compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pre-training, how much for the reinforcement, and how much into inference today? Do you have any sense for how it's splitting and where the growth is the most important as well?\nJensen Huang: Well, today it's vastly in pre-training a foundation model because as you know, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online and whatever you could do in pre-training and post-training, you would try to do so that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone. However, there are only so many things that you could do priority. And so you'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in-context thinking and a reflection. And so I think that the fact that all three are scaling is actually very sensible based on what we are. And in the area of foundation model, now we have multimodality foundation models and the amount of petabytes of video that these foundation models are going to be trained on is incredible. And so my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be scaling pre-training, post-training as well as inference time scaling and which is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute and we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the performance by X factors at a time so that we can continue to drive down the cost and continue to increase their revenues and get the AI revolution going. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thank you. The tremendous growth in our business is being fueled by two fundamental trends that are driving global adoption of NVIDIA computing. First, the computing stack is undergoing a reinvention, a platform shift from coding to machine learning. From executing code on CPUs to processing neural networks on GPUs. The trillion-dollar installed base of traditional Data center infrastructure is being rebuilt for Software 2.0, which applies machine learning to produce AI. Second, the age of AI is in full steam. Generative AI is not just a new software capability, but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence, a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-trillion dollar AI industry. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell, which is now in full production are incredible for several reasons. There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago. The computing scale of pre-training and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI-native start-ups than ever and the number of successful inference services is rising. And with the introduction of ChatGPT o1, OpenAI o1, a new scaling law called test time scaling has emerged. All of these consume a great deal of computing. AI is transforming every industry, company, and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Over time, AI coworkers will assist employees in performing their jobs faster and better. Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI. Driving new training infrastructure demand as researchers train world foundation models on petabytes of video and Omniverse synthetically generated data. The age of robotics is coming. Countries across the world recognize the fundamental AI trends we are seeing and have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI infrastructure. The age of AI is upon us and it's large and diverse. NVIDIA's expertise, scale, and ability to deliver full stack and full infrastructure let us serve the entire multi-trillion dollar AI and robotics opportunities ahead. From every hyperscale cloud, enterprise private cloud to sovereign regional AI clouds, on-prem to industrial edge and robotics. Thanks for joining us today and catch up next time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Let me highlight an upcoming event for the financial community. We will be attending the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference on September 11 in San Francisco, where Jensen will participate in a keynote fireside chat. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for Wednesday, November 20th, 2024. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Stewart. Q2 was another record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with data center, data center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5 times, networking revenue grew more than 2 times from the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% for our data center revenue and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer, Internet, and enterprise companies. Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases, while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Key workloads driving our data center growth include generative AI, model training, and inferencing. Video, image, and text data pre and post-processing with CUDA and AI workloads, synthetic data generation, AI-powered recommender systems, SQL, and vector database processing as well. Next-generation models will require 10 to 20 times more compute to train with significantly more data. The trend is expected to continue. Over the trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than 40% of our data center revenue. CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA's inference platform. Demand for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer Internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and startups building generative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and healthcare, and robotics. Developers desire NVIDIA's rich ecosystem and availability in every cloud. CSPs appreciate the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity given the high demand. NVIDIA H200 platform began ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet, and enterprise company. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the strength of our Hopper architecture and offering, over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100. Our data center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor to our data center revenue. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going-forward. The latest round of MLPerf inference benchmarks highlighted NVIDIA's inference leadership with both NVIDIA, Hopper, and Blackwell platforms combining to win gold medals on all tasks. At Computex, NVIDIA with the top computer manufacturers unveiled an array of Blackwell architecture-powered systems and NVIDIA networking for building AI factories and data centers. With the NVIDIA MGX modular reference architecture, our OEMs and ODM partners are building more than 100 Blackwell-based systems designed quickly and cost-effectively. The NVIDIA Blackwell platform brings together multiple GPU, CPU, DPU, NVLink, NVLink switch, and the networking chips systems, and NVIDIA CUDA software to power the next-generation of AI across the cases, industries, and countries. The NVIDIA GB 200 NVL72 system with the fifth-generation NVLink enables all 72 GPUs to act as a single GPU and deliver up to 30 times faster inference for LLMs, workloads, and unlocking the ability to run trillion parameter models in real-time. Hopper demand is strong and Blackwell is widely sampling. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve production yields. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year '26. In Q4, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025. Hopper supply and availability have improved. Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year. Networking revenue increased 16% sequentially. Our Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes our Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet platform, doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings. Spectrum-X has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs, GPU cloud providers, and enterprise, including X-AI to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world. Spectrum-X supercharges Ethernet for AI processing and delivers 1.6 times the performance of traditional Ethernet. We plan to launch new Spectrum-X products every year to support demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of DPUs today to millions of GPUs in the near future. Spectrum-X is well on-track to begin a multi-billion dollar product line within a year. Our sovereign AI opportunities continue to expand as countries recognize AI expertise and infrastructure at national imperatives for their society and industries. Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is building its AI bridging cloud infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer with NVIDIA. We believe sovereign AI revenue will reach low-double-digit billions this year. The enterprise AI wave has started. Enterprises also drove sequential revenue growth in the quarter. We are working with most of the Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives across industries and geographies. A range of applications are fueling our growth, including AI-powered chatbots, generative AI copilots, and agents to build new monetizable business applications and enhance employee productivity. Amdocs is using NVIDIA generative AI for their smart agent, transforming the customer experience and reducing customer service costs by 30%. ServiceNow is using NVIDIA for its Now Assist offering, the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. SAP is using NVIDIA to build dual Co-pilots. Cohesity is using NVIDIA to build their generative AI agent and lower generative AI development costs. Snowflake serves over 3 billion queries a day for over 10,000 enterprise customers is working with NVIDIA to build Copilots. And lastly, Wistron is using NVIDIA AI Omniverse to reduce end-to-end cycle times for their factories by 50%. Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter as every automaker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using NVIDIA in their data centers. Automotive will drive multi-billion dollars in revenue across on-prem and cloud consumption and will grow as next-generation AV models require significantly more compute. Healthcare is also on its way to being a multi-billion dollar business as AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care, electronic health record processing, and drug discovery. During the quarter, we announced a new NVIDIA AI foundry service to supercharge generative AI for the world's enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1, collection of models. This marks a watershed moment for enterprise AI. Companies for the first time can leverage the capabilities of an open-source frontier-level model to develop customized AI applications to encode their institutional knowledge into an AI flywheel to automate and accelerate their business. Accenture is the first to adopt the new service to build custom Llama 3.1 models for both its own use and to assist clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications. Nvidia NIM accelerate and simplify model deployment. Companies across healthcare, energy, financial services, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are adopting NIMs, including Aramco, Lowe's, and Uber. AT&T realized 70% cost savings and 8 times latency reduction after moving into NIMs for generative AI, call transcription, and classification. Over 150 partners are embedding NIMs across every layer of the AI ecosystem. We announced NIM agent Blueprints, a catalog of customizable reference applications that include a full suite of software for building and deploying enterprise generative AI applications. With NIM agent blueprints, enterprises can refine their AI applications overtime, creating a data-driven AI flywheel. The first NIM agent blueprints include workloads for customer service, computer-aided drug discovery, and enterprise retrieval augmented generation. Our system integrators, technology solution providers, and system builders are bringing NVIDIA NIM agent blueprints to enterprises. NVIDIA NIM and NIM agent blueprints are available through the NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform, which has great momentum. We expect our software, SaaS and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with NVIDIA AI Enterprise notably contributing to growth. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year-on-year. We saw sequential growth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue and demand is strong and growing and channel inventory remains healthy. Every PC with RTX is an AIPC. RTX PCs can deliver up to 1,300 AI tops and there are now over 200 RTX AI laptops designs from leading PC manufacturers. With 600 AI-powered applications and games and an installed base of 100 million devices, RTX is set to revolutionize consumer experiences with generative AI. NVIDIA ACE, a suite of generative AI technologies is available for RTX, AI PCs. Mecha BREAK is the first game to use NVIDIA ACE, including our small large -- small language model, Minitron-4B optimized on device inference. The NVIDIA gaming ecosystem continues to grow, recently added RTX and DLSS titles including Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Dune Awakening, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The GeForce NOW library continues to expand with total catalog size of over 2,000 titles, the most content of any cloud gaming service. Moving to Pro visualization. Revenue of $454 million was up 6% sequentially and 20% year-on-year. Demand is being driven by AI and graphic use cases, including model fine-tuning and Omniverse-related workloads. Automotive and manufacturing were among the key industry verticals driving growth this quarter. Companies are racing to digitalize workflows to drive efficiency across their operations. The world's largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn is using NVIDIA Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA Blackwell systems. And several large global enterprises, including Mercedes-Benz signed multi-year contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins for factories. We announced new NVIDIA USD NIMs and connectors to open Omniverse to new industries and enable developers to incorporate generative AI Copilots and agents into USD workflows, accelerating their ability to build highly accurate virtual worlds. WPP is implementing USD NIM microservices in its generative AI-enabled content creation pipeline for customers such as the Coca-Cola company. Moving to automotive and robotics, revenue was $346 million, up 5% sequentially and up 37% year-on-year. Year-on-year growth was driven by the new customer ramps in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit solutions. At the consumer -- at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference, NVIDIA won the Autonomous Brand Challenge in the end-to-end driving at-scale category, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide. Austin Dynamics, BYD Electronics, Figure, Intrinsic, Siemens, Skilled ADI, and Teradyne Robotics are using the NVIDIA Isaac Robotics platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids, and mobile robots. Now moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins were 75.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 75.7%, down sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within data center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion. In Q2, we utilized cash of $7.4 billion towards shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends, reflecting the increase in dividend per share. Our Board of Directors recently approved a $50 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $7.5 billion of authorization at the end of Q2. Let me turn the outlook for the third quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our third-quarter revenue outlook incorporates continued growth of our Hopper architecture and sampling of our Blackwell products. We expect Blackwell production ramp in Q4. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. As our data center mix continues to shift to new products, we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For the full-year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Full-year operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-to-upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be about $350 million, including gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial detail are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. We are now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please help us poll for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in the prepared comments that there is a change in the Blackwell GPU mask. I'm curious, are there any other incremental changes in back end packaging or anything else? And I think related, you suggested that you could ship several billion dollars of Blackwell in Q4 despite the change in the design. Is it because all these issues will be solved by then? Just help us size what is the overall impact of any changes in Blackwell timing? What that means to your kind of revenue profile and how are customers reacting to it?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. The change to the mask is complete. There were no functional changes necessary. And so we're sampling functional samples of Blackwell -- Grace Blackwell in a variety of system configurations as we speak. There are something like 100 different types of Blackwell-based systems that are built that were shown at Computex. And we're enabling our ecosystem to start sampling those. The functionality of Blackwell is as it is, and we expect to start production in Q4.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I had a relatively longer-term question. As you may know, there's a pretty heated debate in the market on your customers and customer's customers return on investment and what that means for the sustainability of CapEx going forward. Internally at NVIDIA, like what are you guys watching? What's on your dashboard as you try to gauge customer return and how that impacts CapEx? And then a quick follow-up maybe for Colette. I think your sovereign AI number for the full-year went up maybe a couple of billion. What's driving the improved outlook? And how should we think about fiscal '26? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Toshiya. First of all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out. I don't mean starting to ship, but I mean -- I don't mean starting production, but shipping out. On the longer-term question, let's take a step-back and you've heard me say that we're going through two simultaneous platform transitions at the same time. The first one is transitioning from accelerated computing to -- from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because CPU scaling has been known to be slowing for some time. And it is slow to a crawl. And yet the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite significantly. You could maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year. And so if we don't have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world. In fact, you're seeing that. And so the answer is accelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications. It also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing. But what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed. And in fact, this week, there's a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer. And that's really the core of the first platform transition going from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost. And the reason for that is, of course, you just sped up an application 50x, you would expect the computing cost to decline quite significantly. The second was enabled by accelerated computing because we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning so incredibly, that it is now possible to have gigantic scale models, multi-trillion parameter models, and train it on -- pre-train it on just about the world's knowledge corpus and let the model go figure out how to understand a human represent -- human language representation and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning, and so -- which caused the generative AI revolution. Now generative AI, taking a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it is because it's not just a feature, it's not just a capability, it's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer what's the -- what are the expected answers, What are our previous observations. And then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function. It learns a universal -- AI is a bit of a universal function approximator and it learns the function. And so you could learn the function of almost anything, you know. And anything that you have that's predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous examples of. And so now here we are with generative AI. It's a fundamental new form of computer science. It's affecting how every layer of computing is done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms. And the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable. And there are several things that are happening in generative AI. So the first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale. And they're still seeing -- we're still all seeing the benefits of scaling. And whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more than double the size of the dataset to go train it. And so the amount of flops necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically. And so it's not unusual -- it's not unexpected to see that the next-generation models could take 20 -- 10, 20, 40 times more compute than last generation. So we have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly, so we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. So the first one is, there are larger frontier models trained on more modalities and surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so you have more on more on more. That's one of the dynamics going on in generative AI. The second is although it's below the tip of the iceberg. What we see are ChatGPT, image generators, we see coding. We use a generative AI for coding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now. We, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things like that. But those are kind of the tip of the iceberg. What's below the iceberg are the largest systems -- largest computing systems in the world today, which are -- and you've heard me talk about this in the past, which are recommender systems moving from CPUs, it's now moving from CPUs to generative AI. So recommended systems, ad generation, custom ad generation targeting ads at very large scale and quite hyper targeting search and user-generated content. These are all very large-scale applications have now evolved to generative AI. Of course, the number of generative AI startups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners and sovereign AI. Countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource and they have to use -- they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting and you might have seen our announcement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI enterprise platform to the world's enterprises. The companies that we're talking to. So many of them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of their company. And then I -- and then General Robotics. The big transformation last year as we are able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and synthetic data generation from reinforcement learning from systems like Omniverse. We are now able to work with just about every robotics companies now to start thinking about start building on general robotics. And so you can see that there are just so many different directions that generative AI is going. And so we're actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerating.\nColette Kress: And Toshiya, to answer your question regarding sovereign AI and our goals in terms of growth, in terms of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country. So more and more excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries. So yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. Jensen, in the press release, you talked about Blackwell anticipation being incredible, but it seems like Hopper demand is also really strong. I mean, you're guiding for a very strong quarter without Blackwell in October. So how long do you see sort of coexisting strong demand for both? And can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activity is new clusters? Just some sense of what that transition looks like?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong and it's true. The demand for Blackwell is incredible. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is, if you just look at the world's cloud service providers and the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. And the reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example. Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it because it's mundane. It's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words, but almost every single company in the world processes data in the background. And NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Pandas data science, toolkits like Pandas and the new one, Polars, these are the most popular data processing platforms in the world. And aside from CPUs, which as I've mentioned before, really running out of steam, Nvidia's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And so that's number one is the primary -- the number one use-case long before generative AI came along is the migration of applications one after another to accelerated computing. The second is, of course, the rentals. Their renting capacity to model makers or renting it to startup companies and a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products. And so these companies need it now. They just simply can't afford -- you just raise money, you -- they want you to put it to use now. You have processing that you have to do. You can't do it next year, you got to do it today. And so there's a fair -- that's one reason. The second reason for Hopper demand right now is because of the race to the next plateau. So the first person to the next plateau, it gets to be -- gets to introduce a revolutionary level of AI. So the second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same. And so the ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there, is how you establish leadership. NVIDIA is constantly doing that and we show that to the world and the GPUs we make and AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SOCs we create. I mean, we want to set the pace. We want to be consistently the world's best. And that's the reason why, we drive ourselves so hard. And of course, we also want to see our dreams come true, and all of the capabilities that we imagine in the future, and the benefits that we can bring to society. We want to see all that come true. And so these model makers are the same. They're -- of course, they want to be the world's best, they want to be the world's first. And although Blackwell will start shipping out in billions of dollars at the end of this year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or so away. And so between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic. And so everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it, they need accelerated computing. They don't want to build any more general-purpose computing infrastructure and even Hopper, you know, of course, H200 state-of-the-art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear. And so I think people are just clamoring to transition the trillion dollars of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure in Hopper's state-of-the-art.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier question about the debate that investors are having about, I don't know, the ROI on all of this CapEx, and hopefully this question and the distinction will make some sense. But what I'm having discussions about is with like the percentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier towards AGI convergence and as you just said, a new plateau and capability. And they're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their company versus customers that are really, really focused today on CapEx versus ROI. I don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and their time frames are for that investment? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Matt. The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure -- computing infrastructure investment you can make today. And so one way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through is just go back to first principles. You have trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure and the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth of general CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so because it's commoditized. There's already a trillion dollars on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build-out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money. That's tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money, data processing is pricing, just a giant part of it already. And so recommended system save money, so on and so forth, okay? And so you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand-up are going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI. And so your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommended system or next-generation search system? So for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so there's a lot of ways you could think through it. But at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA. That's the best way to do it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had a question on the shape of the revenue growth both near and longer-term. I know, Colette, you did increase OpEx for the year. And if I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations, that's also quite bullish. On the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling and I do recognize that some of these racks can be air-cooled. But Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look into '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power, supply-chain or at some point, models start to get smaller? I'm just wondering if you could speak to that? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: I'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim. So remember, the world is moving from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion dollars’ worth of data centers -- $1 trillion dollars’ worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear is because we need to accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing our -- we don't experience computing inflation. Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we can all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future of computing. And so I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next trillion dollars of the world's infrastructure will clearly be different than the last trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated. With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta, and I think it was Volta. And so we've been shipping the HGX form factor for some time. It is air-cooled. The Grace Blackwell is liquid-cooled. However, the number of data centers that want to go liquid-cooled is quite significant. And the reason for that is because we can in a liquid-cooled data center, in any data center -- power limited data center, whatever size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from 3 times to 5 times, the AI throughput compared to the past. And so liquid cooling is cheaper, liquid cooling TCO is better, and liquid cooling allows you to have the benefit of this capability we call NVLink , which allows us to expand it to 72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs. And so imagine 144 GPUs connected in NVLink and that is -- we're increasingly showing you the benefits of that. And the next click is obviously a very low-latency, very-high throughput, large language model inference. And the large domain is going to be a game-changer for that. And so I think people are very comfortable deploying both. And so almost every CSP we're working with are deploying some of both. And so I -- I'm pretty confident that we'll ramp it up just fine. Your second question out of the third is that looking-forward, yes, next year is going to be a great year. We expect to grow our data center business quite significantly next year. Blackwell is going to be going to be a complete game-changer for the industry. And Blackwell is going to carry into the following year. And as I mentioned earlier, working backwards from first principles. Remember that computing is going through two platform transitions at the same time and that's just really, really important to keep your head on -- your mind focused on, which is general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing and human engineered software is going to transition to generative AI or artificial intelligence learned software.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two short questions for Colette. The first, several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4. I guess is that additive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half. Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell adding several billion dollars? And the second question on gross margins, if I have mid-70s for the year, explaining where I want to draw that. If I have 75% for the year, I'd be something like 71% to 72% for Q4 somewhere in that range. Is that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you're expecting? And how should we think about the drivers of gross margin evolution into next year as Blackwell ramps? And I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and everything come up.\nColette Kress: Yes. So Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp, in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So let's say Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that. Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and the Blackwell starting of -- ramping in Q4. So hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of on our gross margin. We provided gross margin for our Q3. We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75%. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do believe we can do that 75% in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full-year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75%. So we're going to see some slight difference possibly in Q4. Again, with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions. However, I'm not in the same number that you are there. We don't have exactly guidance, but I do believe you're lower than where we are.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Yes, hey, thanks a lot for the question, Jensen and Colette. I wanted to ask about the geographies. There was the 10-Q that came out and the United States was down sequentially while several Asian geographies were up a lot sequentially. Just wondering what the dynamics are there? Obviously, China did very well. You mentioned it in your remarks, what are the puts and takes? And then I just wanted to clarify from Stacy's question, if that means the sequential overall revenue growth rates for the company accelerate in the fourth quarter given all those favorable revenue dynamics? Thanks.\nColette Kress: Let me talk about a bit in terms of our disclosure in terms of the 10-Q, a required disclosure, and a choice of geographies. Very challenging sometimes to create that right disclosure as we have to come up with one key piece. Piece is in terms of we have in terms of who we sell to and/or specifically who we invoice to. And so what you're seeing in terms of there is who we invoice. That's not necessarily where the product will eventually be, and where it may even travel to the end-customer. These are just moving to our OEMs, our ODMs, and our system integrators for the most part across our product portfolio. So what you're seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going into the data center, going into notebooks and those pieces of it. And that shift happens from time-to-time. But yes, our China number there are inverse into China, keep in mind that is incorporating both gaming, also data center, also automotive in those numbers that we have. Going back to your statement in regarding gross margin and also what we're seeing in terms of what we're looking at for Hopper and Blackwell in terms of revenue. Hopper will continue to grow in the second half. We'll continue to grow from what we are currently seeing. During -- determining that exact mix in each Q3 and Q4, we don't have here. We are not here to guide yet in terms of Q4. But we do see right now the demand expectations. We do see the visibility that will be a growth opportunity in Q4. On top of that, we will have our Blackwell architecture.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You've embarked on a remarkable annual product cadence with challenges only likely becoming more and more given rising complexity and a radical limit in advanced package world. So curious, if you take a step back, how does this backdrop alter your thinking around potentially greater vertical integration, supply chain partnerships and then thinking through consequential impact to your margin profile? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes, thanks. Let's see. I think the first answer to your -- the answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because, the complexity of the model is growing and we want to continue to drive its cost down. It's growing, so we want to continue to increase its scale. And we believe that by continuing to scale the AI models that will reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and that it would open up, I realize the next industrial revolution. We believe it. And so we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale. We have the ability fairly uniquely to integrate -- to design an AI factory because we have all the parts. It's not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year, unless you have all the parts. And so we have -- next year, we're going to ship a lot more CPUs than we've ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but also NVLink switches, CX DPUs, ConnectX EPU for East and West, Bluefield DPUs for North and South and data and storage processing to InfiniBand for supercomputing centers to Ethernet, which is a brand-new product for us, which is well on its way to becoming a multi-billion dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet. And so the fact that we could build -- we have access to all of this. We have one architectural stack, as you know. It allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market as we complete it. Otherwise, what happens is, you ship these parts, you go find customers to sell it to and then you've got to build -- somebody has got to build up an AI factory. And the AI factory has got a mountain of software. And so it's not about who integrates it. We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta, Foxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro. We used to be able to serve as ZT. They were recently purchased and so on and so forth. And so the number of ecosystem partners that we have, Gigabyte, ASUS, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows us allows us to -- allows them to take our architecture, which all works, but integrated in a bespoke way into all of the world's cloud service providers, enterprise data centers. The scale and reach necessary from our ODMs and our integrator supply-chain is vast and gigantic because the world is huge. And so that part we don't want to do and we're not good at doing. And I -- but we know how to design the AI infrastructure, provided the way that customers would like it and lets the ecosystem integrate it. Well, yes. So anyways, that's the reason why.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the Rack Scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink? You think about GB, NVL72, and how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell product cycle? I guess put this distinctly, how do you see that mix of Rack Scale systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out?\nJensen Huang: Yes, Aaron, thanks. The Blackwell Rack system, it's designed and architected as a rack, but it's sold, in a disaggregated system components. We don't sell the whole rack. And the reason for that is because everybody's rack is a little different, surprisingly. You know, some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not, some of them are enterprise, and the power limits for everybody could be a little different. Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration into people's data centers, all different. And so the way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack. And then we provide the system components, like for example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX, it's a modular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all over the plant. And so just about any configuration you would like, where you would like that 3,000 pound rack to be delivered. It's got to be close to -- it has to be integrated and assembled close to the data center because it's fairly heavy. And so everything from the supply chain from the moment that we ship the GPU, CPUs, the switches, the NICs. From that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so you can imagine how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs, we've scaled out to with our ODM partners. And so I think that because we show it as one rack and because it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration. Our customers hate that we do integration. The supply-chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration. That's their value-added. There's a final design in, if you will. It's not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center, but the design fit in is really complicated. And so the install -- the design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world. And we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. So integration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it. The way we don't want to be an integrator. We want to be a technology provider.\nOperator: And I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thank you. Let me make a couple more -- make a couple of comments that I made earlier again. That data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper demand remains strong and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible. Let me highlight the top-five things, the top-five things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached a tipping point, CPU scaling slows, developers must accelerate everything possible. Accelerated computing starts with CUDA-X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including accelerated Polars, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries, QVS for vector product vector databases. This is incredibly hot right now. Aerial and Sionna for 5G wireless base station, a whole suite of -- a whole world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for gene sequencing and Alpha-fold two for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize a $1 trillion dollars’ worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number-one. Number two, Blackwell is a step-function leap over Hopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just a GPU. It also happens to be in the name of our GPU, but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's lead becomes clear. The Blackwell Vision took nearly five years and seven one-of-a-kind chips to realize. The Grace CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU, and a coVS package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField DPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive burst traffic of AI. Blackwell AI factories are building-sized computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized the Blackwell platform full stack end-to-end from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling, and mounts of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive infrastructures. Customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides 3 times to 5 times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper. The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal with its all-to-all GPU switch is game-changing. The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72-GB 200 packages into one NVLink domain, with an aggregate NVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second in one rack. Just to put that in perspective, that's about 10 times higher than Hopper, 259 terabytes per second, it kind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multi-trillion parameter models on trillions of tokens. And so that natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU. For inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput, large language model, token generation. We now have three networking platforms, NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's networking footprint is much bigger than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating. Generative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D, physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Internet services are deploying generative AI for large-scale recommenders, ad targeting, and search systems. AI start-ups are consuming tens of billions of dollars yearly of CSP's cloud capacity and countries are recognizing the importance of AI and investing in sovereign AI infrastructure. And NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse is opening up the next era of AI general robotics. And now the enterprise AI wave has started and we're poised to help companies transform their businesses. The NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform consists of NeMo, NIMS, NIM agent blueprints, and AI Foundry, that our ecosystem partners the world-leading IT companies used to help customer -- companies customize AI models and build bespoke AI applications. Enterprises can then deploy on NVIDIA AI Enterprise runtime and at $4,500 per GPU per year, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is an exceptional value for deploying AI anywhere. And for NVIDIA's software TAM can be significant as the CUDA-compatible GPU installed-base grows from millions to tens of millions. And as Colette mentioned, NVIDIA software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate. Thank you all for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Let me highlight an upcoming event for the financial community. We will be attending the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference on September 11 in San Francisco, where Jensen will participate in a keynote fireside chat. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for Wednesday, November 20th, 2024. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Stewart. Q2 was another record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with data center, data center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5 times, networking revenue grew more than 2 times from the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% for our data center revenue and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer, Internet, and enterprise companies. Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases, while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Key workloads driving our data center growth include generative AI, model training, and inferencing. Video, image, and text data pre and post-processing with CUDA and AI workloads, synthetic data generation, AI-powered recommender systems, SQL, and vector database processing as well. Next-generation models will require 10 to 20 times more compute to train with significantly more data. The trend is expected to continue. Over the trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than 40% of our data center revenue. CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA's inference platform. Demand for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer Internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and startups building generative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and healthcare, and robotics. Developers desire NVIDIA's rich ecosystem and availability in every cloud. CSPs appreciate the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity given the high demand. NVIDIA H200 platform began ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet, and enterprise company. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the strength of our Hopper architecture and offering, over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100. Our data center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor to our data center revenue. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going-forward. The latest round of MLPerf inference benchmarks highlighted NVIDIA's inference leadership with both NVIDIA, Hopper, and Blackwell platforms combining to win gold medals on all tasks. At Computex, NVIDIA with the top computer manufacturers unveiled an array of Blackwell architecture-powered systems and NVIDIA networking for building AI factories and data centers. With the NVIDIA MGX modular reference architecture, our OEMs and ODM partners are building more than 100 Blackwell-based systems designed quickly and cost-effectively. The NVIDIA Blackwell platform brings together multiple GPU, CPU, DPU, NVLink, NVLink switch, and the networking chips systems, and NVIDIA CUDA software to power the next-generation of AI across the cases, industries, and countries. The NVIDIA GB 200 NVL72 system with the fifth-generation NVLink enables all 72 GPUs to act as a single GPU and deliver up to 30 times faster inference for LLMs, workloads, and unlocking the ability to run trillion parameter models in real-time. Hopper demand is strong and Blackwell is widely sampling. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve production yields. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year '26. In Q4, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025. Hopper supply and availability have improved. Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year. Networking revenue increased 16% sequentially. Our Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes our Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet platform, doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings. Spectrum-X has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs, GPU cloud providers, and enterprise, including X-AI to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world. Spectrum-X supercharges Ethernet for AI processing and delivers 1.6 times the performance of traditional Ethernet. We plan to launch new Spectrum-X products every year to support demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of DPUs today to millions of GPUs in the near future. Spectrum-X is well on-track to begin a multi-billion dollar product line within a year. Our sovereign AI opportunities continue to expand as countries recognize AI expertise and infrastructure at national imperatives for their society and industries. Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is building its AI bridging cloud infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer with NVIDIA. We believe sovereign AI revenue will reach low-double-digit billions this year. The enterprise AI wave has started. Enterprises also drove sequential revenue growth in the quarter. We are working with most of the Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives across industries and geographies. A range of applications are fueling our growth, including AI-powered chatbots, generative AI copilots, and agents to build new monetizable business applications and enhance employee productivity. Amdocs is using NVIDIA generative AI for their smart agent, transforming the customer experience and reducing customer service costs by 30%. ServiceNow is using NVIDIA for its Now Assist offering, the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. SAP is using NVIDIA to build dual Co-pilots. Cohesity is using NVIDIA to build their generative AI agent and lower generative AI development costs. Snowflake serves over 3 billion queries a day for over 10,000 enterprise customers is working with NVIDIA to build Copilots. And lastly, Wistron is using NVIDIA AI Omniverse to reduce end-to-end cycle times for their factories by 50%. Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter as every automaker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using NVIDIA in their data centers. Automotive will drive multi-billion dollars in revenue across on-prem and cloud consumption and will grow as next-generation AV models require significantly more compute. Healthcare is also on its way to being a multi-billion dollar business as AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care, electronic health record processing, and drug discovery. During the quarter, we announced a new NVIDIA AI foundry service to supercharge generative AI for the world's enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1, collection of models. This marks a watershed moment for enterprise AI. Companies for the first time can leverage the capabilities of an open-source frontier-level model to develop customized AI applications to encode their institutional knowledge into an AI flywheel to automate and accelerate their business. Accenture is the first to adopt the new service to build custom Llama 3.1 models for both its own use and to assist clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications. Nvidia NIM accelerate and simplify model deployment. Companies across healthcare, energy, financial services, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are adopting NIMs, including Aramco, Lowe's, and Uber. AT&T realized 70% cost savings and 8 times latency reduction after moving into NIMs for generative AI, call transcription, and classification. Over 150 partners are embedding NIMs across every layer of the AI ecosystem. We announced NIM agent Blueprints, a catalog of customizable reference applications that include a full suite of software for building and deploying enterprise generative AI applications. With NIM agent blueprints, enterprises can refine their AI applications overtime, creating a data-driven AI flywheel. The first NIM agent blueprints include workloads for customer service, computer-aided drug discovery, and enterprise retrieval augmented generation. Our system integrators, technology solution providers, and system builders are bringing NVIDIA NIM agent blueprints to enterprises. NVIDIA NIM and NIM agent blueprints are available through the NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform, which has great momentum. We expect our software, SaaS and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with NVIDIA AI Enterprise notably contributing to growth. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year-on-year. We saw sequential growth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue and demand is strong and growing and channel inventory remains healthy. Every PC with RTX is an AIPC. RTX PCs can deliver up to 1,300 AI tops and there are now over 200 RTX AI laptops designs from leading PC manufacturers. With 600 AI-powered applications and games and an installed base of 100 million devices, RTX is set to revolutionize consumer experiences with generative AI. NVIDIA ACE, a suite of generative AI technologies is available for RTX, AI PCs. Mecha BREAK is the first game to use NVIDIA ACE, including our small large -- small language model, Minitron-4B optimized on device inference. The NVIDIA gaming ecosystem continues to grow, recently added RTX and DLSS titles including Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Dune Awakening, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The GeForce NOW library continues to expand with total catalog size of over 2,000 titles, the most content of any cloud gaming service. Moving to Pro visualization. Revenue of $454 million was up 6% sequentially and 20% year-on-year. Demand is being driven by AI and graphic use cases, including model fine-tuning and Omniverse-related workloads. Automotive and manufacturing were among the key industry verticals driving growth this quarter. Companies are racing to digitalize workflows to drive efficiency across their operations. The world's largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn is using NVIDIA Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA Blackwell systems. And several large global enterprises, including Mercedes-Benz signed multi-year contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins for factories. We announced new NVIDIA USD NIMs and connectors to open Omniverse to new industries and enable developers to incorporate generative AI Copilots and agents into USD workflows, accelerating their ability to build highly accurate virtual worlds. WPP is implementing USD NIM microservices in its generative AI-enabled content creation pipeline for customers such as the Coca-Cola company. Moving to automotive and robotics, revenue was $346 million, up 5% sequentially and up 37% year-on-year. Year-on-year growth was driven by the new customer ramps in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit solutions. At the consumer -- at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference, NVIDIA won the Autonomous Brand Challenge in the end-to-end driving at-scale category, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide. Austin Dynamics, BYD Electronics, Figure, Intrinsic, Siemens, Skilled ADI, and Teradyne Robotics are using the NVIDIA Isaac Robotics platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids, and mobile robots. Now moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins were 75.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 75.7%, down sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within data center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion. In Q2, we utilized cash of $7.4 billion towards shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends, reflecting the increase in dividend per share. Our Board of Directors recently approved a $50 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $7.5 billion of authorization at the end of Q2. Let me turn the outlook for the third quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our third-quarter revenue outlook incorporates continued growth of our Hopper architecture and sampling of our Blackwell products. We expect Blackwell production ramp in Q4. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. As our data center mix continues to shift to new products, we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For the full-year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Full-year operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-to-upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be about $350 million, including gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial detail are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. We are now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please help us poll for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in the prepared comments that there is a change in the Blackwell GPU mask. I'm curious, are there any other incremental changes in back end packaging or anything else? And I think related, you suggested that you could ship several billion dollars of Blackwell in Q4 despite the change in the design. Is it because all these issues will be solved by then? Just help us size what is the overall impact of any changes in Blackwell timing? What that means to your kind of revenue profile and how are customers reacting to it?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. The change to the mask is complete. There were no functional changes necessary. And so we're sampling functional samples of Blackwell -- Grace Blackwell in a variety of system configurations as we speak. There are something like 100 different types of Blackwell-based systems that are built that were shown at Computex. And we're enabling our ecosystem to start sampling those. The functionality of Blackwell is as it is, and we expect to start production in Q4.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I had a relatively longer-term question. As you may know, there's a pretty heated debate in the market on your customers and customer's customers return on investment and what that means for the sustainability of CapEx going forward. Internally at NVIDIA, like what are you guys watching? What's on your dashboard as you try to gauge customer return and how that impacts CapEx? And then a quick follow-up maybe for Colette. I think your sovereign AI number for the full-year went up maybe a couple of billion. What's driving the improved outlook? And how should we think about fiscal '26? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Toshiya. First of all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out. I don't mean starting to ship, but I mean -- I don't mean starting production, but shipping out. On the longer-term question, let's take a step-back and you've heard me say that we're going through two simultaneous platform transitions at the same time. The first one is transitioning from accelerated computing to -- from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because CPU scaling has been known to be slowing for some time. And it is slow to a crawl. And yet the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite significantly. You could maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year. And so if we don't have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world. In fact, you're seeing that. And so the answer is accelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications. It also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing. But what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed. And in fact, this week, there's a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer. And that's really the core of the first platform transition going from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost. And the reason for that is, of course, you just sped up an application 50x, you would expect the computing cost to decline quite significantly. The second was enabled by accelerated computing because we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning so incredibly, that it is now possible to have gigantic scale models, multi-trillion parameter models, and train it on -- pre-train it on just about the world's knowledge corpus and let the model go figure out how to understand a human represent -- human language representation and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning, and so -- which caused the generative AI revolution. Now generative AI, taking a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it is because it's not just a feature, it's not just a capability, it's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer what's the -- what are the expected answers, What are our previous observations. And then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function. It learns a universal -- AI is a bit of a universal function approximator and it learns the function. And so you could learn the function of almost anything, you know. And anything that you have that's predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous examples of. And so now here we are with generative AI. It's a fundamental new form of computer science. It's affecting how every layer of computing is done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms. And the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable. And there are several things that are happening in generative AI. So the first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale. And they're still seeing -- we're still all seeing the benefits of scaling. And whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more than double the size of the dataset to go train it. And so the amount of flops necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically. And so it's not unusual -- it's not unexpected to see that the next-generation models could take 20 -- 10, 20, 40 times more compute than last generation. So we have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly, so we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. So the first one is, there are larger frontier models trained on more modalities and surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so you have more on more on more. That's one of the dynamics going on in generative AI. The second is although it's below the tip of the iceberg. What we see are ChatGPT, image generators, we see coding. We use a generative AI for coding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now. We, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things like that. But those are kind of the tip of the iceberg. What's below the iceberg are the largest systems -- largest computing systems in the world today, which are -- and you've heard me talk about this in the past, which are recommender systems moving from CPUs, it's now moving from CPUs to generative AI. So recommended systems, ad generation, custom ad generation targeting ads at very large scale and quite hyper targeting search and user-generated content. These are all very large-scale applications have now evolved to generative AI. Of course, the number of generative AI startups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners and sovereign AI. Countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource and they have to use -- they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting and you might have seen our announcement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI enterprise platform to the world's enterprises. The companies that we're talking to. So many of them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of their company. And then I -- and then General Robotics. The big transformation last year as we are able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and synthetic data generation from reinforcement learning from systems like Omniverse. We are now able to work with just about every robotics companies now to start thinking about start building on general robotics. And so you can see that there are just so many different directions that generative AI is going. And so we're actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerating.\nColette Kress: And Toshiya, to answer your question regarding sovereign AI and our goals in terms of growth, in terms of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country. So more and more excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries. So yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. Jensen, in the press release, you talked about Blackwell anticipation being incredible, but it seems like Hopper demand is also really strong. I mean, you're guiding for a very strong quarter without Blackwell in October. So how long do you see sort of coexisting strong demand for both? And can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activity is new clusters? Just some sense of what that transition looks like?\nJensen Huang: Yes. Thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong and it's true. The demand for Blackwell is incredible. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is, if you just look at the world's cloud service providers and the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. And the reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example. Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it because it's mundane. It's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words, but almost every single company in the world processes data in the background. And NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Pandas data science, toolkits like Pandas and the new one, Polars, these are the most popular data processing platforms in the world. And aside from CPUs, which as I've mentioned before, really running out of steam, Nvidia's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And so that's number one is the primary -- the number one use-case long before generative AI came along is the migration of applications one after another to accelerated computing. The second is, of course, the rentals. Their renting capacity to model makers or renting it to startup companies and a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products. And so these companies need it now. They just simply can't afford -- you just raise money, you -- they want you to put it to use now. You have processing that you have to do. You can't do it next year, you got to do it today. And so there's a fair -- that's one reason. The second reason for Hopper demand right now is because of the race to the next plateau. So the first person to the next plateau, it gets to be -- gets to introduce a revolutionary level of AI. So the second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same. And so the ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there, is how you establish leadership. NVIDIA is constantly doing that and we show that to the world and the GPUs we make and AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SOCs we create. I mean, we want to set the pace. We want to be consistently the world's best. And that's the reason why, we drive ourselves so hard. And of course, we also want to see our dreams come true, and all of the capabilities that we imagine in the future, and the benefits that we can bring to society. We want to see all that come true. And so these model makers are the same. They're -- of course, they want to be the world's best, they want to be the world's first. And although Blackwell will start shipping out in billions of dollars at the end of this year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or so away. And so between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic. And so everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it, they need accelerated computing. They don't want to build any more general-purpose computing infrastructure and even Hopper, you know, of course, H200 state-of-the-art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear. And so I think people are just clamoring to transition the trillion dollars of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure in Hopper's state-of-the-art.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier question about the debate that investors are having about, I don't know, the ROI on all of this CapEx, and hopefully this question and the distinction will make some sense. But what I'm having discussions about is with like the percentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier towards AGI convergence and as you just said, a new plateau and capability. And they're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their company versus customers that are really, really focused today on CapEx versus ROI. I don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and their time frames are for that investment? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Matt. The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure -- computing infrastructure investment you can make today. And so one way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through is just go back to first principles. You have trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure and the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth of general CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so because it's commoditized. There's already a trillion dollars on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build-out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money. That's tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money, data processing is pricing, just a giant part of it already. And so recommended system save money, so on and so forth, okay? And so you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand-up are going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI. And so your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommended system or next-generation search system? So for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so there's a lot of ways you could think through it. But at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA. That's the best way to do it.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had a question on the shape of the revenue growth both near and longer-term. I know, Colette, you did increase OpEx for the year. And if I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations, that's also quite bullish. On the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling and I do recognize that some of these racks can be air-cooled. But Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look into '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power, supply-chain or at some point, models start to get smaller? I'm just wondering if you could speak to that? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: I'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim. So remember, the world is moving from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion dollars’ worth of data centers -- $1 trillion dollars’ worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear is because we need to accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing our -- we don't experience computing inflation. Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we can all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future of computing. And so I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next trillion dollars of the world's infrastructure will clearly be different than the last trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated. With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta, and I think it was Volta. And so we've been shipping the HGX form factor for some time. It is air-cooled. The Grace Blackwell is liquid-cooled. However, the number of data centers that want to go liquid-cooled is quite significant. And the reason for that is because we can in a liquid-cooled data center, in any data center -- power limited data center, whatever size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from 3 times to 5 times, the AI throughput compared to the past. And so liquid cooling is cheaper, liquid cooling TCO is better, and liquid cooling allows you to have the benefit of this capability we call NVLink , which allows us to expand it to 72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs. And so imagine 144 GPUs connected in NVLink and that is -- we're increasingly showing you the benefits of that. And the next click is obviously a very low-latency, very-high throughput, large language model inference. And the large domain is going to be a game-changer for that. And so I think people are very comfortable deploying both. And so almost every CSP we're working with are deploying some of both. And so I -- I'm pretty confident that we'll ramp it up just fine. Your second question out of the third is that looking-forward, yes, next year is going to be a great year. We expect to grow our data center business quite significantly next year. Blackwell is going to be going to be a complete game-changer for the industry. And Blackwell is going to carry into the following year. And as I mentioned earlier, working backwards from first principles. Remember that computing is going through two platform transitions at the same time and that's just really, really important to keep your head on -- your mind focused on, which is general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing and human engineered software is going to transition to generative AI or artificial intelligence learned software.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two short questions for Colette. The first, several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4. I guess is that additive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half. Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell adding several billion dollars? And the second question on gross margins, if I have mid-70s for the year, explaining where I want to draw that. If I have 75% for the year, I'd be something like 71% to 72% for Q4 somewhere in that range. Is that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you're expecting? And how should we think about the drivers of gross margin evolution into next year as Blackwell ramps? And I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and everything come up.\nColette Kress: Yes. So Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp, in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So let's say Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that. Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and the Blackwell starting of -- ramping in Q4. So hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of on our gross margin. We provided gross margin for our Q3. We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75%. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do believe we can do that 75% in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full-year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75%. So we're going to see some slight difference possibly in Q4. Again, with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions. However, I'm not in the same number that you are there. We don't have exactly guidance, but I do believe you're lower than where we are.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Yes, hey, thanks a lot for the question, Jensen and Colette. I wanted to ask about the geographies. There was the 10-Q that came out and the United States was down sequentially while several Asian geographies were up a lot sequentially. Just wondering what the dynamics are there? Obviously, China did very well. You mentioned it in your remarks, what are the puts and takes? And then I just wanted to clarify from Stacy's question, if that means the sequential overall revenue growth rates for the company accelerate in the fourth quarter given all those favorable revenue dynamics? Thanks.\nColette Kress: Let me talk about a bit in terms of our disclosure in terms of the 10-Q, a required disclosure, and a choice of geographies. Very challenging sometimes to create that right disclosure as we have to come up with one key piece. Piece is in terms of we have in terms of who we sell to and/or specifically who we invoice to. And so what you're seeing in terms of there is who we invoice. That's not necessarily where the product will eventually be, and where it may even travel to the end-customer. These are just moving to our OEMs, our ODMs, and our system integrators for the most part across our product portfolio. So what you're seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going into the data center, going into notebooks and those pieces of it. And that shift happens from time-to-time. But yes, our China number there are inverse into China, keep in mind that is incorporating both gaming, also data center, also automotive in those numbers that we have. Going back to your statement in regarding gross margin and also what we're seeing in terms of what we're looking at for Hopper and Blackwell in terms of revenue. Hopper will continue to grow in the second half. We'll continue to grow from what we are currently seeing. During -- determining that exact mix in each Q3 and Q4, we don't have here. We are not here to guide yet in terms of Q4. But we do see right now the demand expectations. We do see the visibility that will be a growth opportunity in Q4. On top of that, we will have our Blackwell architecture.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You've embarked on a remarkable annual product cadence with challenges only likely becoming more and more given rising complexity and a radical limit in advanced package world. So curious, if you take a step back, how does this backdrop alter your thinking around potentially greater vertical integration, supply chain partnerships and then thinking through consequential impact to your margin profile? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes, thanks. Let's see. I think the first answer to your -- the answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because, the complexity of the model is growing and we want to continue to drive its cost down. It's growing, so we want to continue to increase its scale. And we believe that by continuing to scale the AI models that will reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and that it would open up, I realize the next industrial revolution. We believe it. And so we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale. We have the ability fairly uniquely to integrate -- to design an AI factory because we have all the parts. It's not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year, unless you have all the parts. And so we have -- next year, we're going to ship a lot more CPUs than we've ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but also NVLink switches, CX DPUs, ConnectX EPU for East and West, Bluefield DPUs for North and South and data and storage processing to InfiniBand for supercomputing centers to Ethernet, which is a brand-new product for us, which is well on its way to becoming a multi-billion dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet. And so the fact that we could build -- we have access to all of this. We have one architectural stack, as you know. It allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market as we complete it. Otherwise, what happens is, you ship these parts, you go find customers to sell it to and then you've got to build -- somebody has got to build up an AI factory. And the AI factory has got a mountain of software. And so it's not about who integrates it. We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta, Foxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro. We used to be able to serve as ZT. They were recently purchased and so on and so forth. And so the number of ecosystem partners that we have, Gigabyte, ASUS, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows us allows us to -- allows them to take our architecture, which all works, but integrated in a bespoke way into all of the world's cloud service providers, enterprise data centers. The scale and reach necessary from our ODMs and our integrator supply-chain is vast and gigantic because the world is huge. And so that part we don't want to do and we're not good at doing. And I -- but we know how to design the AI infrastructure, provided the way that customers would like it and lets the ecosystem integrate it. Well, yes. So anyways, that's the reason why.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the Rack Scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink? You think about GB, NVL72, and how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell product cycle? I guess put this distinctly, how do you see that mix of Rack Scale systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out?\nJensen Huang: Yes, Aaron, thanks. The Blackwell Rack system, it's designed and architected as a rack, but it's sold, in a disaggregated system components. We don't sell the whole rack. And the reason for that is because everybody's rack is a little different, surprisingly. You know, some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not, some of them are enterprise, and the power limits for everybody could be a little different. Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration into people's data centers, all different. And so the way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack. And then we provide the system components, like for example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX, it's a modular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all over the plant. And so just about any configuration you would like, where you would like that 3,000 pound rack to be delivered. It's got to be close to -- it has to be integrated and assembled close to the data center because it's fairly heavy. And so everything from the supply chain from the moment that we ship the GPU, CPUs, the switches, the NICs. From that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so you can imagine how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs, we've scaled out to with our ODM partners. And so I think that because we show it as one rack and because it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration. Our customers hate that we do integration. The supply-chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration. That's their value-added. There's a final design in, if you will. It's not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center, but the design fit in is really complicated. And so the install -- the design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world. And we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. So integration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it. The way we don't want to be an integrator. We want to be a technology provider.\nOperator: And I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.\nJensen Huang: Thank you. Let me make a couple more -- make a couple of comments that I made earlier again. That data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper demand remains strong and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible. Let me highlight the top-five things, the top-five things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached a tipping point, CPU scaling slows, developers must accelerate everything possible. Accelerated computing starts with CUDA-X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including accelerated Polars, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries, QVS for vector product vector databases. This is incredibly hot right now. Aerial and Sionna for 5G wireless base station, a whole suite of -- a whole world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for gene sequencing and Alpha-fold two for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize a $1 trillion dollars’ worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number-one. Number two, Blackwell is a step-function leap over Hopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just a GPU. It also happens to be in the name of our GPU, but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's lead becomes clear. The Blackwell Vision took nearly five years and seven one-of-a-kind chips to realize. The Grace CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU, and a coVS package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField DPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive burst traffic of AI. Blackwell AI factories are building-sized computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized the Blackwell platform full stack end-to-end from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling, and mounts of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive infrastructures. Customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides 3 times to 5 times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper. The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal with its all-to-all GPU switch is game-changing. The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72-GB 200 packages into one NVLink domain, with an aggregate NVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second in one rack. Just to put that in perspective, that's about 10 times higher than Hopper, 259 terabytes per second, it kind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multi-trillion parameter models on trillions of tokens. And so that natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU. For inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput, large language model, token generation. We now have three networking platforms, NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's networking footprint is much bigger than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating. Generative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D, physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Internet services are deploying generative AI for large-scale recommenders, ad targeting, and search systems. AI start-ups are consuming tens of billions of dollars yearly of CSP's cloud capacity and countries are recognizing the importance of AI and investing in sovereign AI infrastructure. And NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse is opening up the next era of AI general robotics. And now the enterprise AI wave has started and we're poised to help companies transform their businesses. The NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform consists of NeMo, NIMS, NIM agent blueprints, and AI Foundry, that our ecosystem partners the world-leading IT companies used to help customer -- companies customize AI models and build bespoke AI applications. Enterprises can then deploy on NVIDIA AI Enterprise runtime and at $4,500 per GPU per year, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is an exceptional value for deploying AI anywhere. And for NVIDIA's software TAM can be significant as the CUDA-compatible GPU installed-base grows from millions to tens of millions. And as Colette mentioned, NVIDIA software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate. Thank you all for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And on June 5th, we will present at the Bank of America Technology Conference in San Francisco. With that let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q1 was another record quarter. Revenue of $26 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 262% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $24 billion. Starting with Data Center. Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was a record, up 23% sequentially and up 427% year-on-year, driven by continued strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue more than 3x from last year. Strong sequential data center growth was driven by all customer types, led by enterprise and consumer internet companies. Large cloud providers continue to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale and represented the mid-40s as a percentage of our Data Center revenue. Training and inferencing AI on NVIDIA CUDA is driving meaningful acceleration in cloud rental revenue growth, delivering an immediate and strong return on cloud provider's investment. For every $1 spent on NVIDIA AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years. NVIDIA's rich software stack and ecosystem and tight integration with cloud providers makes it easy for end customers up and running on NVIDIA GPU instances in the public cloud. For cloud rental customers, NVIDIA GPUs offer the best time to train models, the lowest cost to train models and the lowest cost to inference large language models. For public cloud providers, NVIDIA brings customers to their cloud, driving revenue growth and returns on their infrastructure investments. Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla's expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption. Consumer Internet companies are also a strong growth vertical. A big highlight this quarter was Meta's announcement of Llama 3, their latest large language model, which was trained on a cluster of 24,000 H100 GPUs. Llama 3 powers Meta AI, a new AI assistant available on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Llama 3 is openly available and has kickstarted a wave of AI development across industries. As generative AI makes its way into more consumer Internet applications, we expect to see continued growth opportunities as inference scales both with model complexity as well as with the number of users and number of queries per user, driving much more demand for AI compute. In our trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. Both training and inference are growing significantly. Large clusters like the ones built by Meta and Tesla are examples of the essential infrastructure for AI production, what we refer to as AI factories. These next-generation data centers host advanced full-stack accelerated computing platforms where the data comes in and intelligence comes out. In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs. From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in Sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks. Nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some are procuring and operating Sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunication providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use. For example, Japan plans to invest more than $740 million in key digital infrastructure providers, including KDDI, Sakura Internet, and SoftBank to build out the nation's Sovereign AI infrastructure. France-based, Scaleway, a subsidiary of the Iliad Group, is building Europe's most powerful cloud native AI supercomputer. In Italy, Swisscom Group will build the nation's first and most powerful NVIDIA DGX-powered supercomputer to develop the first LLM natively trained in the Italian language. And in Singapore, the National Supercomputer Center is getting upgraded with NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while Singtel is building NVIDIA's accelerated AI factories across Southeast Asia. NVIDIA's ability to offer end-to-end compute to networking technologies, full-stack software, AI expertise, and rich ecosystem of partners and customers allows Sovereign AI and regional cloud providers to jumpstart their country's AI ambitions. From nothing the previous year, we believe Sovereign AI revenue can approach the high single-digit billions this year. The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that don't require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. From a product perspective, the vast majority of compute revenue was driven by our Hopper GPU architecture. Demand for Hopper during the quarter continues to increase. Thanks to CUDA algorithm innovations, we've been able to accelerate LLM inference on H100 by up to 3x, which can translate to a 3x cost reduction for serving popular models like Llama 3. We started sampling the H200 in Q1 and are currently in production with shipments on track for Q2. The first H200 system was delivered by Jensen to Sam Altman and the team at OpenAI and powered their amazing GPT-4o demos last week. H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100, delivering significant value for production deployments. For example, using Llama 3 with 700 billion parameters, a single NVIDIA HGX H200 server can deliver 24,000 tokens per second, supporting more than 2,400 users at the same time. That means for every $1 spent on NVIDIA HGX H200 servers at current prices per token, an API provider serving Llama 3 tokens can generate $7 in revenue over four years. With ongoing software optimizations, we continue to improve the performance of NVIDIA AI infrastructure for serving AI models. While supply for H100 prove, we are still constrained on H200. At the same time, Blackwell is in full production. We are working to bring up our system and cloud partners for global availability later this year. Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year. Grace Hopper Superchip is shipping in volume. Last week at the International Supercomputing Conference, we announced that nine new supercomputers worldwide are using Grace Hopper for a combined 200 exaflops of energy-efficient AI processing power delivered this year. These include the Alps Supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center, the fastest AI supercomputer in Europe. Isambard-AI at the University of Bristol in the UK and JUPITER in the Julich Supercomputing Center in Germany. We are seeing an 80% attach rate of Grace Hopper in supercomputing due to its high energy efficiency and performance. We are also proud to see supercomputers powered with Grace Hopper take the number one, the number two, and the number three spots of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. Strong networking year-on-year growth was driven by InfiniBand. We experienced a modest sequential decline, which was largely due to the timing of supply, with demand well ahead of what we were able to ship. We expect networking to return to sequential growth in Q2. In the first quarter, we started shipping our new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution optimized for AI from the ground up. It includes our Spectrum-4 switch, BlueField-3 DPU, and new software technologies to overcome the challenges of AI on Ethernet to deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, including a massive 100,000 GPU cluster. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market to NVIDIA networking and enables Ethernet only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI. We expect Spectrum-X to jump to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year. At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling. Blackwell will be available in over 100 OEM and ODM systems at launch, more than double the number of Hopper's launch and representing every major computer maker in the world. This will support fast and broad adoption across the customer types, workloads and data center environments in the first year shipments. Blackwell time-to-market customers include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and xAI. We announced a new software product with the introduction of NVIDIA Inference Microservices or NIM. NIM provides secure and performance-optimized containers powered by NVIDIA CUDA acceleration in network computing and inference software, including Triton Inference Server and TensorRT LLM with industry-standard APIs for a broad range of use cases, including large language models for text, speech, imaging, vision, robotics, genomics and digital biology. They enable developers to quickly build and deploy generative AI applications using leading models from NVIDIA, AI21, Adept, Cohere, Getty Images, and Shutterstock and open models from Google, Hugging Face, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Snowflake and Stability AI. NIMs will be offered as part of our NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform for production deployment in the cloud or on-prem. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.65 billion was down 8% sequentially and up 18% year-on-year, consistent with our outlook for a seasonal decline. The GeForce RTX Super GPUs market reception is strong and end demand and channel inventory remained healthy across the product range. From the very start of our AI journey, we equipped GeForce RTX GPUs with CUDA Tensor Cores. Now with over 100 million of an installed base, GeForce RTX GPUs are perfect for gamers, creators, AI enthusiasts and offer unmatched performance for running generative AI applications on PCs. NVIDIA has full technology stack for deploying and running fast and efficient generative AI inference on GeForce RTX PCs. TensorRT LLM now accelerates Microsoft's Phi-3-Mini model and Google's Gemma 2B and 7B models as well as popular AI frameworks, including LangChain and LlamaIndex. Yesterday, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced AI performance optimizations for Windows to help run LLMs up to 3x faster on NVIDIA GeForce RTX AI PCs. And top game developers, including NetEase Games, Tencent and Ubisoft are embracing NVIDIA Avatar Character Engine to create lifelike avatars to transform interactions between gamers and nonplayable characters. Moving to ProVis. Revenue of $427 million was down 8% sequentially and up 45% year-on-year. We believe generative AI and Omniverse industrial digitalization will drive the next wave of professional visualization growth. At GTC, we announced new Omniverse Cloud APIs to enable developers to integrate Omniverse industrial digital twin and simulation technologies into their applications. Some of the world's largest industrial software makers are adopting these APIs, including ANSYS, Cadence, 3DEXCITE at Dassault Systemes, Brand and Siemens. And developers can use them to stream industrial digital twins with spatial computing devices such as Apple Vision Pro. Omniverse Cloud APIs will be available on Microsoft Azure later this year. Companies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse power digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations. Moving to automotive. Revenue was $329 million, up 17% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. Sequential growth was driven by the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers and strength in our self-driving platforms. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by self-driving. We supported Xiaomi in the successful launch of its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, our AI car computer for software-defined AV fleets. We also announced a number of new design wins on NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, the successor to Orin, powered by the new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with several leading EV makers, including BYD, XPeng, GAC's Aion Hyper and Neuro. DRIVE Thor is slated for production vehicles starting next year. Okay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded sequentially to 78.4% and non-GAAP gross margins to 78.9% on lower inventory targets. As noted last quarter, both Q4 and Q1 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 10% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs and increased compute and infrastructure investments. In Q1, we returned $7.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Today, we announced a 10-for-1 split of our shares with June 10th as the first day of trading on a split-adjusted basis. We are also increasing our dividend by 150%. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in all market platforms. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points, consistent with our discussion last quarter. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Full year OpEx is expected to grow in the low 40% range. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately, excuse me, approximately $300 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. I would like to now turn it over to Jensen as he would like to make a few comments.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Colette. The industry is going through a major change. Before we start Q&A, let me give you some perspective on the importance of the transformation. The next industrial revolution has begun. Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence. AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost and energy efficient while expanding revenue opportunities. CSPs were the first generative AI movers. With NVIDIA, CSPs accelerated workloads to save money and power. The tokens generated by NVIDIA Hopper drive revenues for their AI services. And NVIDIA cloud instances attract rental customers from our rich ecosystem of developers. Strong and accelerated demand -- accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on Hopper platform propels our Data Center growth. Training continues to scale as models learn to be multimodal, understanding text, speech, images, video and 3D and learn to reason and plan. Our inference workloads are growing incredibly. With generative AI, inference, which is now about fast token generation at massive scale, has become incredibly complex. Generative AI is driving a from-foundation-up full stack computing platform shift that will transform every computer interaction. From today's information retrieval model, we are shifting to an answers and skills generation model of computing. AI will understand context and our intentions, be knowledgeable, reason, plan and perform tasks. We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do, from general purpose CPU to GPU accelerated computing, from instruction-driven software to intention-understanding models, from retrieving information to performing skills, and at the industrial level, from producing software to generating tokens, manufacturing digital intelligence. Token generation will drive a multiyear build-out of AI factories. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, Sovereign AI, automotive, and health care customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter scale generative AI. The combination of Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, mix and switches, high-speed interconnects and a rich ecosystem of software and partners let us expand and offer a richer and more complete solution for AI factories than previous generations. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIMs is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere, from the cloud to on-prem data centers to RTX AI PCs through our expansive network of ecosystem partners. From Blackwell to Spectrum-X to NIMs, we are poised for the next wave of growth. Thank you.\nSimona Jankowski: Thank you, Jensen. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to drill a little bit into the Blackwell comment that it's in full production now. What does that suggest with regard to shipments and delivery timing if that product is -- doesn't sound like it's sampling anymore. What does that mean when that's actually in customers' hands if it's in production now?\nJensen Huang: We will be shipping. Well, we've been in production for a little bit of time. But our production shipments will start in Q2 and ramp in Q3, and customers should have data centers stood up in Q4.\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. So this year, we will see Blackwell revenue, it sounds like?\nJensen Huang: We will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just between the systems nature and all the demand for GB that you have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center. So do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think about how that's all going? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Blackwell comes in many configurations. Blackwell is a platform, not a GPU. And the platform includes support for air cooled, liquid cooled, x86 and Grace, InfiniBand, now Spectrum-X and very large NVLink domain that I demonstrated at GTC, that I showed at GTC. And so for some customers, they will ramp into their existing installed base of data centers that are already shipping Hoppers. They will easily transition from H100 to H200 to B100. And so Blackwell systems have been designed to be backwards compatible, if you will, electrically, mechanically. And of course, the software stack that runs on Hopper will run fantastically on Blackwell. We also have been priming the pump, if you will, with the entire ecosystem, getting them ready for liquid cooling. We've been talking to the ecosystem about Blackwell for quite some time. And the CSPs, the data centers, the ODMs, the system makers, our supply chain beyond them, the cooling supply chain base, liquid cooling supply chain base, data center supply chain base, no one is going to be surprised with Blackwell coming and the capabilities that we would like to deliver with Grace Blackwell 200. GB200 is going to be exceptional.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull-ahead or holding behavior because of tight supply, competition or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace with your really very strong shipment growth?\nJensen Huang: Well, I guess, there's the big picture view that I'll come to, and then, but I'll answer your question directly. The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing every single day. And the reason for that is because applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4o, and now it's going to be multi-modality and Gemini and its ramp and Anthropic and all of the work that's being done at all the CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there. There's also a long line of generative AI startups, some 15,000, 20,000 startups that in all different fields from multimedia to digital characters, of course, all kinds of design tool application -- productivity applications, digital biology, the moving of the AV industry to video, so that they can train end-to-end models, to expand the operating domain of self-driving cars. The list is just quite extraordinary. We're racing actually. Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand it up as quickly as possible. And of course, I haven't even mentioned all of the Sovereign AIs who would like to train all of their regional natural resource of their country, which is their data to train their regional models. And there's a lot of pressure to stand those systems up. So anyhow, the demand, I think, is really, really high and it outstrips our supply. Longer term, that's what -- that's the reason why I jumped in to make a few comments. Longer term, we're completely redesigning how computers work. And this is a platform shift. Of course, it's been compared to other platform shifts in the past. But time will clearly tell that this is much, much more profound than previous platform shifts. And the reason for that is because the computer is no longer an instruction-driven only computer. It's an intention-understanding computer. And it understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do and it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan and come back with a solution. And so every aspect of the computer is changing in such a way that instead of retrieving prerecorded files, it is now generating contextually relevant intelligent answers. And so that's going to change computing stacks all over the world. And you saw a build that, in fact, even the PC computing stack is going to get revolutionized. And this is just the beginning of all the things that -- what people see today are the beginning of the things that we're working in our labs and the things that we're doing with all the startups and large companies and developers all over the world. It's going to be quite extraordinary.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I understand what you just said about how strong demand is. You have a lot of demand for H200 and for Blackwell products. Do you anticipate any kind of pause with Hopper and H100 as you sort of migrate to those products? Will people wait for those new products, which would be a good product to have? Or do you think there's enough demand for H100 to sustain growth?\nJensen Huang: We see increasing demand of Hopper through this quarter. And we expect to be -- we expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everybody is anxious to get their infrastructure online. And the reason for that is because they're saving money and making money, and they would like to do that as soon as possible.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I wanted to ask about competition. I think many of your cloud customers have announced new or updates to their existing internal programs, right, in parallel to what they're working on with you guys. To what extent did you consider them as competitors, medium to long term? And in your view, do you think they're limited to addressing most internal workloads or could they be broader in what they address going forward? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: We're different in several ways. First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline from unstructured data processing to prepare it for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference. And as I was mentioning in my remarks, that inference has really fundamentally changed, it's now generation. It's not trying to just detect the cat, which was plenty hard in itself, but it has to generate every pixel of a cat. And so the generation process is a fundamentally different processing architecture. And it's one of the reasons why TensorRT LLM was so well received. We improved the performance in using the same chips on our architecture by a factor of three. That kind of tells you something about the richness of our architecture and the richness of our software. So one, you could use NVIDIA for everything, from computer vision to image processing, the computer graphics to all modalities of computing. And as the world is now suffering from computing cost and computing energy inflation because general-purpose computing has run its course, accelerated computing is really the sustainable way of going forward. So accelerated computing is how you're going to save money in computing, is how you're going to save energy in computing. And so the versatility of our platform results in the lowest TCO for their data center. Second, we're in every cloud. And so for developers that are looking for a platform to develop on, starting with NVIDIA is always a great choice. And we're on-prem, we're in the cloud. We're in computers of any size and shape. We're practically everywhere. And so that's the second reason. The third reason has to do with the fact that we build AI factories. And this is becoming more an apparent to people that AI is not a chip problem only. It starts, of course, with very good chips and we build a whole bunch of chips for our AI factories, but it's a systems problem. In fact, even AI is now a systems problem. It's not just one large language model. It's a complex system of a whole bunch of large language models that are working together. And so the fact that NVIDIA builds this system causes us to optimize all of our chips to work together as a system, to be able to have software that operates as a system, and to be able to optimize across the system. And just to put it in perspective in simple numbers, if you had a $5 billion infrastructure and you improved the performance by a factor of two, which we routinely do, when you improve the infrastructure by a factor of two, the value too is $5 billion. All the chips in that data center doesn't pay for it. And so the value of it is really quite extraordinary. And this is the reason why today, performance matters everything. This is at a time when the highest performance is also the lowest cost because the infrastructure cost of carrying all of these chips cost a lot of money. And it takes a lot of money to fund the data center, to operate the data center, the people that goes along with it, the power that goes along with it, the real estate that goes along with it, and all of it adds up. And so the highest performance is also the lowest TCO.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Jensen, I've been in the data center industry my whole career. I've never seen the velocity that you guys are introducing new platforms at the same combination of the performance jumps that you're getting, I mean, 5x in training. Some of the stuff you talked about at GTC up to 30x in inference. And it's an amazing thing to watch but, it also creates an interesting juxtaposition where the current generation of product that your customers are spending billions of dollars on, it's going to be not as competitive with your new stuff, very, very much more quickly than the depreciation cycle of that product. So I'd like you to -- if you wouldn't mind speak a little bit about how you're seeing that situation evolve itself with customers. As you move to Blackwell, you're going to have very large installed bases, obviously software compatible, but large installed bases of product that's not nearly as performant as your new generation stuff. And it'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. I really appreciate it. Three points that I'd like to make. If you're 5% into the build-out versus if you're 95% into the build out, you're going to feel very differently. And because you're only 5% into the build-out anyhow, you build as fast as you can. And when Blackwell comes, it's going to be terrific. And then after Blackwell, as you mentioned, we have other Blackwells coming. And then there's a short -- we're in a one-year rhythm as we've explained to the world. And we want our customers to see our road map for as far as they like, but they're early in their build-out anyways and so they had to just keep on building, okay. And so there's going to be a whole bunch of chips coming at them, and they just got to keep on building and just, if you will, performance average your way into it. So that's the smart thing to do. They need to make money today. They want to save money today. And time is really, really valuable to them. Let me give you an example of time being really valuable, why this idea of standing up a data center instantaneously is so valuable and getting this thing called time to train is so valuable. The reason for that is because the next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI. And the second one after that gets to announce something that's 0.3% better. And so the question is, do you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? And that's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important. And you're seeing this race across multiple companies because this is so vital to have technology leadership, for companies to trust the leadership and want to build on your platform and know that the platform that they're building on is going to get better and better. And so leadership matters a great deal. Time to train matters a great deal. The difference between time to train that is three months earlier just to get it done, in order to get time to train on three-months project, getting started three months earlier is everything. And so it's the reason why we're standing up Hopper systems like mad right now because the next plateau is just around the corner. And so that's the second reason. The first comment that you made is really a great comment, which is how is it that we're doing -- we're moving so fast and advancing them quickly? Because we have all the stacks here. We literally build the entire data center and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything. We know where all the bottlenecks are. We're not guessing about it. We're not putting up PowerPoint slides that look good. We're actually -- we also like our PowerPoint slides look good, but we're delivering systems that perform at scale. And the reason why we know they perform at scale is because we built it all here. Now one of the things that we do that's a bit of a miracle is that we build entire AI infrastructure here, but then we disaggregated and integrated into our customers' data centers however they liked. But we know how it's going to perform and we know where the bottlenecks are. We know where we need to optimize with them and we know where we have to help them improve their infrastructure to achieve the most performance. This deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today. We build every single chip from the ground up. We know exactly how processing is done across the entire system. And so we understand exactly how it's going to perform and how to get the most out of it with every single generation. So I appreciate. Those are the three points.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMark Lipacis: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each computing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down. And this is a motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do let me know. So the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing, which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so then the question is about does the general purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support that historical general purpose framework? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile, but I wouldn't call it general-purpose. Like for example, we wouldn't be very good at running the spreadsheet. That was really designed for general-purpose computing. And so there is a -- the control loop of an operating system code probably isn't fantastic for general-purpose compute, not for accelerated computing. And so I would say that we're versatile, and that's usually the way I describe it. There's a rich domain of applications that we're able to accelerate over the years, but they all have a lot of commonalities. Maybe some deep differences, but commonalities. They're all things that I can run in parallel, they're all heavily threaded. 5% of the code represents 99% of the run-time, for example. Those are all properties of accelerated computing. The versatility of our platform and the fact that we design entire systems is the reason why over the course of the last 10 years or so, the number of start-ups that you guys have asked me about in these conference calls is fairly large. And every single one of them, because of the brittleness of their architecture, the moment generative AI came along or the moment the fusion models came along, the moment the next models are coming along now. And now all of a sudden, look at this, large language models with memory because the large language model needs to have memory so they can carry on a conversation with you, understand the context. All of a sudden, the versatility of the Grace memory became super important. And so each one of these advances in generative AI and the advancement of AI really begs for not having a widget that's designed for one model. But to have something that is really good for this entire domain, properties of this entire domain, but obeys the first principles of software, that software is going to continue to evolve, that software is going to keep getting better and bigger. We believe in the scaling of these models. There's a lot of reasons why we're going to scale by easily a million times in the coming few years for good reasons, and we're looking forward to it and we're ready for it. And so the versatility of our platform is really quite key. And it's not -- if you're too brittle and too specific, you might as well just build an FPGA or you build an ASIC or something like that, but that's hardly a computer.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for taking my question. Actually kind of curious, I mean, being supply constrained, how do you think about , I mean, you came out with a product for China, H20. I'm assuming there'd be a ton of demand for it, but obviously, you're trying to serve your customers with the other Hopper products. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about that in the second half. You could elaborate any impact, what you're thinking for sales as well as gross margin.\nJensen Huang: I didn't hear your questions. Something bleeped out.\nSimona Jankowski: H20 and how you're thinking about allocating supply between the different Hopper products.\nJensen Huang: Well, we have customers that we honor and we do our best for every customer. It is the case that our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past. And it's a lot more competitive in China now because of the limitations on our technology. And so those matters are true. However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there and to the best of our ability, we'll do our best. But I think overall, the comments that we made about demand outstripping supply is for the entire market and particularly so for H200 and Blackwell towards the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Jensen, actually more of a clarification on what you said. GB 200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs and the systems business was relatively small. So I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO or is it something else or is it just the architecture? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. I appreciate that. In fact, the way we sell GB200 is the same. We disaggregate all of the components that make sense and we integrate it into computer makers. We have 100 different computer system configurations that are coming this year for Blackwell. And that is off the charts. Hopper, frankly, had only half, but that's at its peak. It started out with way less than that even. And so you're going to see liquid cooled version, air cooled version, x86 visions, Grace versions, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of systems that are being designed. And they're offered from all of our ecosystem of great partners. Nothing has really changed. Now of course, the Blackwell platform has expanded our offering tremendously. The integration of CPUs and the much more compressed density of computing, liquid cooling is going to save data centers a lot of money in provisioning power and not to mention to be more energy efficient. And so it's a much better solution. It's more expansive, meaning that we offer a lot more components of a data center and everybody wins. The data center gets much higher performance, networking from networking switches, networking. Of course, NICs, we have Ethernet now so that we can bring NVIDIA AI to a large-scale NVIDIA AI to customers who only operate only know how to operate Ethernet because of the ecosystem that they have. And so Blackwell is much more expansive. We have a lot more to offer our customers this generation around.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line William Stein with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, at some point, NVIDIA decided that while there are reasonably good CPUs available for data center operations, your ARM-based Grace CPU provides some real advantage that made that technology worth delivering to customers, perhaps related to cost or power consumption or technical synergies between Grace and Hopper, Grace and Blackwell. Can you address whether there could be a similar dynamic that might emerge on the client side, whereby while there are very good solutions, you've highlighted that Intel and AMD are very good partners and deliver great products in x86, but there might be some, especially in emerging AI workloads, some advantage that NVIDIA can deliver that others have more of a challenge?\nJensen Huang: Well, you mentioned some really good reasons. It is true that for many of the applications, our partnership with x86 partners are really terrific and we build excellent systems together. But Grace allows us to do something that isn't possible with the configuration, the system configuration today. The memory system between Grace and Hopper are coherent and connected. The interconnect between the two chips, calling it two chips is almost weird because it's like a superchip. The two of them are connected with this interface that's like a terabytes per second. It's off the charts. And the memory that's used by Grace is LPDDR. It's the first data center-grade low-power memory. And so we save a lot of power on every single node. And then finally, because of the architecture, because we can create our own architecture with the entire system now, we could create something that has a really large NVLink domain, which is vitally important to the next-generation large language models for inferencing. And so you saw that GB200 has a 72-node NVLink domain. That's like 72 Blackwells connected together into one giant GPU. And so we needed Grace Blackwells to be able to do that. And so there are architectural reasons, there are software programming reasons and then there are system reasons that are essential for us to build them that way. And so if we see opportunities like that, we'll explore it. And today, as you saw at the build yesterday, which I thought was really excellent, Satya announced the next-generation PCs, Copilot+ PC, which runs fantastically on NVIDIA's RTX GPUs that are shipping in laptops. But it also supports ARM beautifully. And so it opens up opportunities for system innovation even for PCs.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, a bit of a longer-term question. I know Blackwell hasn't even launched yet, but obviously, investors are forward-looking and amidst rising potential competition from GPUs and custom ASICs, how are you thinking about NVIDIA's pace of innovation and your million-fold scaling over the last decade, truly impressive. CUDA, Varsity, Precision, Grace, Cohere and Connectivity. When you look forward, what frictions need to be solved in the coming decade? And I guess, maybe more importantly, what are you willing to share with us today?\nJensen Huang: Well, I can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip. And we are on a one-year rhythm. And so and you can also count that -- count on us having new networking technology on a very fast rhythm. We're announcing Spectrum-X for Ethernet. But we're all in on Ethernet, and we have a really exciting road map coming for Ethernet. We have a rich ecosystem of partners. Dell announced that they're taking Spectrum-X to market. We have a rich ecosystem of customers and partners who are going to announce taking our entire AI factory architecture to market. And so for companies that want the ultimate performance, we have InfiniBand computing fabric. InfiniBand is a computing fabric, Ethernet is a network. And InfiniBand, over the years, started out as a computing fabric, became a better and better network. Ethernet is a network and with Spectrum-X, we're going to make it a much better computing fabric. And we're committed -- fully committed to all three links, NVLink computing fabric for single computing domain to InfiniBand computing fabric, to Ethernet networking computing fabric. And so we're going to take all three of them forward at a very fast clip. And so you're going to see new switches coming, new NICs coming, new capability, new software stacks that run on all three of them. New CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches, a mound of chips that are coming. And all of it, the beautiful thing is all of it runs CUDA. And all of it runs our entire software stack. So you invest today on our software stack, without doing anything at all, it's just going to get faster and faster and faster and faster. And if you invest in our architecture today, without doing anything, it will go to more and more clouds and more and more data centers and everything just runs. And so I think the pace of innovation that we're bringing will drive up the capability, on the one hand, and drive down the TCO on the other hand. And so we should be able to scale out with the NVIDIA architecture for this new era of computing and start this new industrial revolution where we manufacture not just software anymore, but we manufacture artificial intelligence tokens and we're going to do that at scale. Thank you.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session and our call for today. We thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

And on June 5th, we will present at the Bank of America Technology Conference in San Francisco. With that let me turn the call over to Colette.\nColette Kress: Thanks, Simona. Q1 was another record quarter. Revenue of $26 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 262% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $24 billion. Starting with Data Center. Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was a record, up 23% sequentially and up 427% year-on-year, driven by continued strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue more than 3x from last year. Strong sequential data center growth was driven by all customer types, led by enterprise and consumer internet companies. Large cloud providers continue to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale and represented the mid-40s as a percentage of our Data Center revenue. Training and inferencing AI on NVIDIA CUDA is driving meaningful acceleration in cloud rental revenue growth, delivering an immediate and strong return on cloud provider's investment. For every $1 spent on NVIDIA AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years. NVIDIA's rich software stack and ecosystem and tight integration with cloud providers makes it easy for end customers up and running on NVIDIA GPU instances in the public cloud. For cloud rental customers, NVIDIA GPUs offer the best time to train models, the lowest cost to train models and the lowest cost to inference large language models. For public cloud providers, NVIDIA brings customers to their cloud, driving revenue growth and returns on their infrastructure investments. Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla's expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption. Consumer Internet companies are also a strong growth vertical. A big highlight this quarter was Meta's announcement of Llama 3, their latest large language model, which was trained on a cluster of 24,000 H100 GPUs. Llama 3 powers Meta AI, a new AI assistant available on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Llama 3 is openly available and has kickstarted a wave of AI development across industries. As generative AI makes its way into more consumer Internet applications, we expect to see continued growth opportunities as inference scales both with model complexity as well as with the number of users and number of queries per user, driving much more demand for AI compute. In our trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. Both training and inference are growing significantly. Large clusters like the ones built by Meta and Tesla are examples of the essential infrastructure for AI production, what we refer to as AI factories. These next-generation data centers host advanced full-stack accelerated computing platforms where the data comes in and intelligence comes out. In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs. From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in Sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks. Nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some are procuring and operating Sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunication providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use. For example, Japan plans to invest more than $740 million in key digital infrastructure providers, including KDDI, Sakura Internet, and SoftBank to build out the nation's Sovereign AI infrastructure. France-based, Scaleway, a subsidiary of the Iliad Group, is building Europe's most powerful cloud native AI supercomputer. In Italy, Swisscom Group will build the nation's first and most powerful NVIDIA DGX-powered supercomputer to develop the first LLM natively trained in the Italian language. And in Singapore, the National Supercomputer Center is getting upgraded with NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while Singtel is building NVIDIA's accelerated AI factories across Southeast Asia. NVIDIA's ability to offer end-to-end compute to networking technologies, full-stack software, AI expertise, and rich ecosystem of partners and customers allows Sovereign AI and regional cloud providers to jumpstart their country's AI ambitions. From nothing the previous year, we believe Sovereign AI revenue can approach the high single-digit billions this year. The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that don't require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. From a product perspective, the vast majority of compute revenue was driven by our Hopper GPU architecture. Demand for Hopper during the quarter continues to increase. Thanks to CUDA algorithm innovations, we've been able to accelerate LLM inference on H100 by up to 3x, which can translate to a 3x cost reduction for serving popular models like Llama 3. We started sampling the H200 in Q1 and are currently in production with shipments on track for Q2. The first H200 system was delivered by Jensen to Sam Altman and the team at OpenAI and powered their amazing GPT-4o demos last week. H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100, delivering significant value for production deployments. For example, using Llama 3 with 700 billion parameters, a single NVIDIA HGX H200 server can deliver 24,000 tokens per second, supporting more than 2,400 users at the same time. That means for every $1 spent on NVIDIA HGX H200 servers at current prices per token, an API provider serving Llama 3 tokens can generate $7 in revenue over four years. With ongoing software optimizations, we continue to improve the performance of NVIDIA AI infrastructure for serving AI models. While supply for H100 prove, we are still constrained on H200. At the same time, Blackwell is in full production. We are working to bring up our system and cloud partners for global availability later this year. Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year. Grace Hopper Superchip is shipping in volume. Last week at the International Supercomputing Conference, we announced that nine new supercomputers worldwide are using Grace Hopper for a combined 200 exaflops of energy-efficient AI processing power delivered this year. These include the Alps Supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center, the fastest AI supercomputer in Europe. Isambard-AI at the University of Bristol in the UK and JUPITER in the Julich Supercomputing Center in Germany. We are seeing an 80% attach rate of Grace Hopper in supercomputing due to its high energy efficiency and performance. We are also proud to see supercomputers powered with Grace Hopper take the number one, the number two, and the number three spots of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. Strong networking year-on-year growth was driven by InfiniBand. We experienced a modest sequential decline, which was largely due to the timing of supply, with demand well ahead of what we were able to ship. We expect networking to return to sequential growth in Q2. In the first quarter, we started shipping our new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution optimized for AI from the ground up. It includes our Spectrum-4 switch, BlueField-3 DPU, and new software technologies to overcome the challenges of AI on Ethernet to deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, including a massive 100,000 GPU cluster. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market to NVIDIA networking and enables Ethernet only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI. We expect Spectrum-X to jump to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year. At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling. Blackwell will be available in over 100 OEM and ODM systems at launch, more than double the number of Hopper's launch and representing every major computer maker in the world. This will support fast and broad adoption across the customer types, workloads and data center environments in the first year shipments. Blackwell time-to-market customers include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and xAI. We announced a new software product with the introduction of NVIDIA Inference Microservices or NIM. NIM provides secure and performance-optimized containers powered by NVIDIA CUDA acceleration in network computing and inference software, including Triton Inference Server and TensorRT LLM with industry-standard APIs for a broad range of use cases, including large language models for text, speech, imaging, vision, robotics, genomics and digital biology. They enable developers to quickly build and deploy generative AI applications using leading models from NVIDIA, AI21, Adept, Cohere, Getty Images, and Shutterstock and open models from Google, Hugging Face, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Snowflake and Stability AI. NIMs will be offered as part of our NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform for production deployment in the cloud or on-prem. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.65 billion was down 8% sequentially and up 18% year-on-year, consistent with our outlook for a seasonal decline. The GeForce RTX Super GPUs market reception is strong and end demand and channel inventory remained healthy across the product range. From the very start of our AI journey, we equipped GeForce RTX GPUs with CUDA Tensor Cores. Now with over 100 million of an installed base, GeForce RTX GPUs are perfect for gamers, creators, AI enthusiasts and offer unmatched performance for running generative AI applications on PCs. NVIDIA has full technology stack for deploying and running fast and efficient generative AI inference on GeForce RTX PCs. TensorRT LLM now accelerates Microsoft's Phi-3-Mini model and Google's Gemma 2B and 7B models as well as popular AI frameworks, including LangChain and LlamaIndex. Yesterday, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced AI performance optimizations for Windows to help run LLMs up to 3x faster on NVIDIA GeForce RTX AI PCs. And top game developers, including NetEase Games, Tencent and Ubisoft are embracing NVIDIA Avatar Character Engine to create lifelike avatars to transform interactions between gamers and nonplayable characters. Moving to ProVis. Revenue of $427 million was down 8% sequentially and up 45% year-on-year. We believe generative AI and Omniverse industrial digitalization will drive the next wave of professional visualization growth. At GTC, we announced new Omniverse Cloud APIs to enable developers to integrate Omniverse industrial digital twin and simulation technologies into their applications. Some of the world's largest industrial software makers are adopting these APIs, including ANSYS, Cadence, 3DEXCITE at Dassault Systemes, Brand and Siemens. And developers can use them to stream industrial digital twins with spatial computing devices such as Apple Vision Pro. Omniverse Cloud APIs will be available on Microsoft Azure later this year. Companies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse power digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations. Moving to automotive. Revenue was $329 million, up 17% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. Sequential growth was driven by the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers and strength in our self-driving platforms. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by self-driving. We supported Xiaomi in the successful launch of its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, our AI car computer for software-defined AV fleets. We also announced a number of new design wins on NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, the successor to Orin, powered by the new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with several leading EV makers, including BYD, XPeng, GAC's Aion Hyper and Neuro. DRIVE Thor is slated for production vehicles starting next year. Okay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded sequentially to 78.4% and non-GAAP gross margins to 78.9% on lower inventory targets. As noted last quarter, both Q4 and Q1 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 10% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs and increased compute and infrastructure investments. In Q1, we returned $7.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Today, we announced a 10-for-1 split of our shares with June 10th as the first day of trading on a split-adjusted basis. We are also increasing our dividend by 150%. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in all market platforms. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points, consistent with our discussion last quarter. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Full year OpEx is expected to grow in the low 40% range. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately, excuse me, approximately $300 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. I would like to now turn it over to Jensen as he would like to make a few comments.\nJensen Huang: Thanks, Colette. The industry is going through a major change. Before we start Q&A, let me give you some perspective on the importance of the transformation. The next industrial revolution has begun. Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence. AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost and energy efficient while expanding revenue opportunities. CSPs were the first generative AI movers. With NVIDIA, CSPs accelerated workloads to save money and power. The tokens generated by NVIDIA Hopper drive revenues for their AI services. And NVIDIA cloud instances attract rental customers from our rich ecosystem of developers. Strong and accelerated demand -- accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on Hopper platform propels our Data Center growth. Training continues to scale as models learn to be multimodal, understanding text, speech, images, video and 3D and learn to reason and plan. Our inference workloads are growing incredibly. With generative AI, inference, which is now about fast token generation at massive scale, has become incredibly complex. Generative AI is driving a from-foundation-up full stack computing platform shift that will transform every computer interaction. From today's information retrieval model, we are shifting to an answers and skills generation model of computing. AI will understand context and our intentions, be knowledgeable, reason, plan and perform tasks. We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do, from general purpose CPU to GPU accelerated computing, from instruction-driven software to intention-understanding models, from retrieving information to performing skills, and at the industrial level, from producing software to generating tokens, manufacturing digital intelligence. Token generation will drive a multiyear build-out of AI factories. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, Sovereign AI, automotive, and health care customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter scale generative AI. The combination of Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, mix and switches, high-speed interconnects and a rich ecosystem of software and partners let us expand and offer a richer and more complete solution for AI factories than previous generations. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIMs is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere, from the cloud to on-prem data centers to RTX AI PCs through our expansive network of ecosystem partners. From Blackwell to Spectrum-X to NIMs, we are poised for the next wave of growth. Thank you.\nSimona Jankowski: Thank you, Jensen. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to drill a little bit into the Blackwell comment that it's in full production now. What does that suggest with regard to shipments and delivery timing if that product is -- doesn't sound like it's sampling anymore. What does that mean when that's actually in customers' hands if it's in production now?\nJensen Huang: We will be shipping. Well, we've been in production for a little bit of time. But our production shipments will start in Q2 and ramp in Q3, and customers should have data centers stood up in Q4.\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. So this year, we will see Blackwell revenue, it sounds like?\nJensen Huang: We will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just between the systems nature and all the demand for GB that you have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center. So do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think about how that's all going? Thanks.\nJensen Huang: Yes. Blackwell comes in many configurations. Blackwell is a platform, not a GPU. And the platform includes support for air cooled, liquid cooled, x86 and Grace, InfiniBand, now Spectrum-X and very large NVLink domain that I demonstrated at GTC, that I showed at GTC. And so for some customers, they will ramp into their existing installed base of data centers that are already shipping Hoppers. They will easily transition from H100 to H200 to B100. And so Blackwell systems have been designed to be backwards compatible, if you will, electrically, mechanically. And of course, the software stack that runs on Hopper will run fantastically on Blackwell. We also have been priming the pump, if you will, with the entire ecosystem, getting them ready for liquid cooling. We've been talking to the ecosystem about Blackwell for quite some time. And the CSPs, the data centers, the ODMs, the system makers, our supply chain beyond them, the cooling supply chain base, liquid cooling supply chain base, data center supply chain base, no one is going to be surprised with Blackwell coming and the capabilities that we would like to deliver with Grace Blackwell 200. GB200 is going to be exceptional.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull-ahead or holding behavior because of tight supply, competition or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace with your really very strong shipment growth?\nJensen Huang: Well, I guess, there's the big picture view that I'll come to, and then, but I'll answer your question directly. The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing every single day. And the reason for that is because applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4o, and now it's going to be multi-modality and Gemini and its ramp and Anthropic and all of the work that's being done at all the CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there. There's also a long line of generative AI startups, some 15,000, 20,000 startups that in all different fields from multimedia to digital characters, of course, all kinds of design tool application -- productivity applications, digital biology, the moving of the AV industry to video, so that they can train end-to-end models, to expand the operating domain of self-driving cars. The list is just quite extraordinary. We're racing actually. Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand it up as quickly as possible. And of course, I haven't even mentioned all of the Sovereign AIs who would like to train all of their regional natural resource of their country, which is their data to train their regional models. And there's a lot of pressure to stand those systems up. So anyhow, the demand, I think, is really, really high and it outstrips our supply. Longer term, that's what -- that's the reason why I jumped in to make a few comments. Longer term, we're completely redesigning how computers work. And this is a platform shift. Of course, it's been compared to other platform shifts in the past. But time will clearly tell that this is much, much more profound than previous platform shifts. And the reason for that is because the computer is no longer an instruction-driven only computer. It's an intention-understanding computer. And it understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do and it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan and come back with a solution. And so every aspect of the computer is changing in such a way that instead of retrieving prerecorded files, it is now generating contextually relevant intelligent answers. And so that's going to change computing stacks all over the world. And you saw a build that, in fact, even the PC computing stack is going to get revolutionized. And this is just the beginning of all the things that -- what people see today are the beginning of the things that we're working in our labs and the things that we're doing with all the startups and large companies and developers all over the world. It's going to be quite extraordinary.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I understand what you just said about how strong demand is. You have a lot of demand for H200 and for Blackwell products. Do you anticipate any kind of pause with Hopper and H100 as you sort of migrate to those products? Will people wait for those new products, which would be a good product to have? Or do you think there's enough demand for H100 to sustain growth?\nJensen Huang: We see increasing demand of Hopper through this quarter. And we expect to be -- we expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everybody is anxious to get their infrastructure online. And the reason for that is because they're saving money and making money, and they would like to do that as soon as possible.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I wanted to ask about competition. I think many of your cloud customers have announced new or updates to their existing internal programs, right, in parallel to what they're working on with you guys. To what extent did you consider them as competitors, medium to long term? And in your view, do you think they're limited to addressing most internal workloads or could they be broader in what they address going forward? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: We're different in several ways. First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline from unstructured data processing to prepare it for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference. And as I was mentioning in my remarks, that inference has really fundamentally changed, it's now generation. It's not trying to just detect the cat, which was plenty hard in itself, but it has to generate every pixel of a cat. And so the generation process is a fundamentally different processing architecture. And it's one of the reasons why TensorRT LLM was so well received. We improved the performance in using the same chips on our architecture by a factor of three. That kind of tells you something about the richness of our architecture and the richness of our software. So one, you could use NVIDIA for everything, from computer vision to image processing, the computer graphics to all modalities of computing. And as the world is now suffering from computing cost and computing energy inflation because general-purpose computing has run its course, accelerated computing is really the sustainable way of going forward. So accelerated computing is how you're going to save money in computing, is how you're going to save energy in computing. And so the versatility of our platform results in the lowest TCO for their data center. Second, we're in every cloud. And so for developers that are looking for a platform to develop on, starting with NVIDIA is always a great choice. And we're on-prem, we're in the cloud. We're in computers of any size and shape. We're practically everywhere. And so that's the second reason. The third reason has to do with the fact that we build AI factories. And this is becoming more an apparent to people that AI is not a chip problem only. It starts, of course, with very good chips and we build a whole bunch of chips for our AI factories, but it's a systems problem. In fact, even AI is now a systems problem. It's not just one large language model. It's a complex system of a whole bunch of large language models that are working together. And so the fact that NVIDIA builds this system causes us to optimize all of our chips to work together as a system, to be able to have software that operates as a system, and to be able to optimize across the system. And just to put it in perspective in simple numbers, if you had a $5 billion infrastructure and you improved the performance by a factor of two, which we routinely do, when you improve the infrastructure by a factor of two, the value too is $5 billion. All the chips in that data center doesn't pay for it. And so the value of it is really quite extraordinary. And this is the reason why today, performance matters everything. This is at a time when the highest performance is also the lowest cost because the infrastructure cost of carrying all of these chips cost a lot of money. And it takes a lot of money to fund the data center, to operate the data center, the people that goes along with it, the power that goes along with it, the real estate that goes along with it, and all of it adds up. And so the highest performance is also the lowest TCO.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Ramsay: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Jensen, I've been in the data center industry my whole career. I've never seen the velocity that you guys are introducing new platforms at the same combination of the performance jumps that you're getting, I mean, 5x in training. Some of the stuff you talked about at GTC up to 30x in inference. And it's an amazing thing to watch but, it also creates an interesting juxtaposition where the current generation of product that your customers are spending billions of dollars on, it's going to be not as competitive with your new stuff, very, very much more quickly than the depreciation cycle of that product. So I'd like you to -- if you wouldn't mind speak a little bit about how you're seeing that situation evolve itself with customers. As you move to Blackwell, you're going to have very large installed bases, obviously software compatible, but large installed bases of product that's not nearly as performant as your new generation stuff. And it'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path. Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. I really appreciate it. Three points that I'd like to make. If you're 5% into the build-out versus if you're 95% into the build out, you're going to feel very differently. And because you're only 5% into the build-out anyhow, you build as fast as you can. And when Blackwell comes, it's going to be terrific. And then after Blackwell, as you mentioned, we have other Blackwells coming. And then there's a short -- we're in a one-year rhythm as we've explained to the world. And we want our customers to see our road map for as far as they like, but they're early in their build-out anyways and so they had to just keep on building, okay. And so there's going to be a whole bunch of chips coming at them, and they just got to keep on building and just, if you will, performance average your way into it. So that's the smart thing to do. They need to make money today. They want to save money today. And time is really, really valuable to them. Let me give you an example of time being really valuable, why this idea of standing up a data center instantaneously is so valuable and getting this thing called time to train is so valuable. The reason for that is because the next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI. And the second one after that gets to announce something that's 0.3% better. And so the question is, do you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? And that's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important. And you're seeing this race across multiple companies because this is so vital to have technology leadership, for companies to trust the leadership and want to build on your platform and know that the platform that they're building on is going to get better and better. And so leadership matters a great deal. Time to train matters a great deal. The difference between time to train that is three months earlier just to get it done, in order to get time to train on three-months project, getting started three months earlier is everything. And so it's the reason why we're standing up Hopper systems like mad right now because the next plateau is just around the corner. And so that's the second reason. The first comment that you made is really a great comment, which is how is it that we're doing -- we're moving so fast and advancing them quickly? Because we have all the stacks here. We literally build the entire data center and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything. We know where all the bottlenecks are. We're not guessing about it. We're not putting up PowerPoint slides that look good. We're actually -- we also like our PowerPoint slides look good, but we're delivering systems that perform at scale. And the reason why we know they perform at scale is because we built it all here. Now one of the things that we do that's a bit of a miracle is that we build entire AI infrastructure here, but then we disaggregated and integrated into our customers' data centers however they liked. But we know how it's going to perform and we know where the bottlenecks are. We know where we need to optimize with them and we know where we have to help them improve their infrastructure to achieve the most performance. This deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today. We build every single chip from the ground up. We know exactly how processing is done across the entire system. And so we understand exactly how it's going to perform and how to get the most out of it with every single generation. So I appreciate. Those are the three points.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMark Lipacis: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each computing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down. And this is a motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do let me know. So the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing, which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so then the question is about does the general purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support that historical general purpose framework? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile, but I wouldn't call it general-purpose. Like for example, we wouldn't be very good at running the spreadsheet. That was really designed for general-purpose computing. And so there is a -- the control loop of an operating system code probably isn't fantastic for general-purpose compute, not for accelerated computing. And so I would say that we're versatile, and that's usually the way I describe it. There's a rich domain of applications that we're able to accelerate over the years, but they all have a lot of commonalities. Maybe some deep differences, but commonalities. They're all things that I can run in parallel, they're all heavily threaded. 5% of the code represents 99% of the run-time, for example. Those are all properties of accelerated computing. The versatility of our platform and the fact that we design entire systems is the reason why over the course of the last 10 years or so, the number of start-ups that you guys have asked me about in these conference calls is fairly large. And every single one of them, because of the brittleness of their architecture, the moment generative AI came along or the moment the fusion models came along, the moment the next models are coming along now. And now all of a sudden, look at this, large language models with memory because the large language model needs to have memory so they can carry on a conversation with you, understand the context. All of a sudden, the versatility of the Grace memory became super important. And so each one of these advances in generative AI and the advancement of AI really begs for not having a widget that's designed for one model. But to have something that is really good for this entire domain, properties of this entire domain, but obeys the first principles of software, that software is going to continue to evolve, that software is going to keep getting better and bigger. We believe in the scaling of these models. There's a lot of reasons why we're going to scale by easily a million times in the coming few years for good reasons, and we're looking forward to it and we're ready for it. And so the versatility of our platform is really quite key. And it's not -- if you're too brittle and too specific, you might as well just build an FPGA or you build an ASIC or something like that, but that's hardly a computer.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for taking my question. Actually kind of curious, I mean, being supply constrained, how do you think about , I mean, you came out with a product for China, H20. I'm assuming there'd be a ton of demand for it, but obviously, you're trying to serve your customers with the other Hopper products. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about that in the second half. You could elaborate any impact, what you're thinking for sales as well as gross margin.\nJensen Huang: I didn't hear your questions. Something bleeped out.\nSimona Jankowski: H20 and how you're thinking about allocating supply between the different Hopper products.\nJensen Huang: Well, we have customers that we honor and we do our best for every customer. It is the case that our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past. And it's a lot more competitive in China now because of the limitations on our technology. And so those matters are true. However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there and to the best of our ability, we'll do our best. But I think overall, the comments that we made about demand outstripping supply is for the entire market and particularly so for H200 and Blackwell towards the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Jensen, actually more of a clarification on what you said. GB 200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs and the systems business was relatively small. So I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO or is it something else or is it just the architecture? Thank you.\nJensen Huang: Yes. I appreciate that. In fact, the way we sell GB200 is the same. We disaggregate all of the components that make sense and we integrate it into computer makers. We have 100 different computer system configurations that are coming this year for Blackwell. And that is off the charts. Hopper, frankly, had only half, but that's at its peak. It started out with way less than that even. And so you're going to see liquid cooled version, air cooled version, x86 visions, Grace versions, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of systems that are being designed. And they're offered from all of our ecosystem of great partners. Nothing has really changed. Now of course, the Blackwell platform has expanded our offering tremendously. The integration of CPUs and the much more compressed density of computing, liquid cooling is going to save data centers a lot of money in provisioning power and not to mention to be more energy efficient. And so it's a much better solution. It's more expansive, meaning that we offer a lot more components of a data center and everybody wins. The data center gets much higher performance, networking from networking switches, networking. Of course, NICs, we have Ethernet now so that we can bring NVIDIA AI to a large-scale NVIDIA AI to customers who only operate only know how to operate Ethernet because of the ecosystem that they have. And so Blackwell is much more expansive. We have a lot more to offer our customers this generation around.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line William Stein with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, at some point, NVIDIA decided that while there are reasonably good CPUs available for data center operations, your ARM-based Grace CPU provides some real advantage that made that technology worth delivering to customers, perhaps related to cost or power consumption or technical synergies between Grace and Hopper, Grace and Blackwell. Can you address whether there could be a similar dynamic that might emerge on the client side, whereby while there are very good solutions, you've highlighted that Intel and AMD are very good partners and deliver great products in x86, but there might be some, especially in emerging AI workloads, some advantage that NVIDIA can deliver that others have more of a challenge?\nJensen Huang: Well, you mentioned some really good reasons. It is true that for many of the applications, our partnership with x86 partners are really terrific and we build excellent systems together. But Grace allows us to do something that isn't possible with the configuration, the system configuration today. The memory system between Grace and Hopper are coherent and connected. The interconnect between the two chips, calling it two chips is almost weird because it's like a superchip. The two of them are connected with this interface that's like a terabytes per second. It's off the charts. And the memory that's used by Grace is LPDDR. It's the first data center-grade low-power memory. And so we save a lot of power on every single node. And then finally, because of the architecture, because we can create our own architecture with the entire system now, we could create something that has a really large NVLink domain, which is vitally important to the next-generation large language models for inferencing. And so you saw that GB200 has a 72-node NVLink domain. That's like 72 Blackwells connected together into one giant GPU. And so we needed Grace Blackwells to be able to do that. And so there are architectural reasons, there are software programming reasons and then there are system reasons that are essential for us to build them that way. And so if we see opportunities like that, we'll explore it. And today, as you saw at the build yesterday, which I thought was really excellent, Satya announced the next-generation PCs, Copilot+ PC, which runs fantastically on NVIDIA's RTX GPUs that are shipping in laptops. But it also supports ARM beautifully. And so it opens up opportunities for system innovation even for PCs.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, a bit of a longer-term question. I know Blackwell hasn't even launched yet, but obviously, investors are forward-looking and amidst rising potential competition from GPUs and custom ASICs, how are you thinking about NVIDIA's pace of innovation and your million-fold scaling over the last decade, truly impressive. CUDA, Varsity, Precision, Grace, Cohere and Connectivity. When you look forward, what frictions need to be solved in the coming decade? And I guess, maybe more importantly, what are you willing to share with us today?\nJensen Huang: Well, I can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip. And we are on a one-year rhythm. And so and you can also count that -- count on us having new networking technology on a very fast rhythm. We're announcing Spectrum-X for Ethernet. But we're all in on Ethernet, and we have a really exciting road map coming for Ethernet. We have a rich ecosystem of partners. Dell announced that they're taking Spectrum-X to market. We have a rich ecosystem of customers and partners who are going to announce taking our entire AI factory architecture to market. And so for companies that want the ultimate performance, we have InfiniBand computing fabric. InfiniBand is a computing fabric, Ethernet is a network. And InfiniBand, over the years, started out as a computing fabric, became a better and better network. Ethernet is a network and with Spectrum-X, we're going to make it a much better computing fabric. And we're committed -- fully committed to all three links, NVLink computing fabric for single computing domain to InfiniBand computing fabric, to Ethernet networking computing fabric. And so we're going to take all three of them forward at a very fast clip. And so you're going to see new switches coming, new NICs coming, new capability, new software stacks that run on all three of them. New CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches, a mound of chips that are coming. And all of it, the beautiful thing is all of it runs CUDA. And all of it runs our entire software stack. So you invest today on our software stack, without doing anything at all, it's just going to get faster and faster and faster and faster. And if you invest in our architecture today, without doing anything, it will go to more and more clouds and more and more data centers and everything just runs. And so I think the pace of innovation that we're bringing will drive up the capability, on the one hand, and drive down the TCO on the other hand. And so we should be able to scale out with the NVIDIA architecture for this new era of computing and start this new industrial revolution where we manufacture not just software anymore, but we manufacture artificial intelligence tokens and we're going to do that at scale. Thank you.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session and our call for today. We thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

I'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry’s CEO.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Good morning. Thank you Christina and welcome everyone. As noted in our press release, our record third quarter results outperformed expectations, reinforcing our position of strength. Our talented global teams drove accelerated top and bottom line growth against an increasingly complex backdrop, clearly demonstrating the power of consistent brand building and our connections with consumers around the world. Touching on the highlights of the quarter. First, we powered global growth with total revenue gains of 8% at constant currency, outpacing guidance fueled by 15% growth at Coach. By geography, international revenue rose 8%, led by an increase of 35% in Europe, where our business has strong momentum and the opportunity for continued growth is significant. In addition, we delivered a sales increase of 4% in the total APAC region. In Greater China specifically, revenue growth accelerated, rising 5% as we continue to confidently invest behind our long-term growth agenda in the region and with this important consumer cohort. And in North America, revenue increased 9% compared to last year, and gross and operating margin continued to expand, reinforcing our commitment to driving a healthy business. Second, we built new and lasting relationships with consumers around the world. In North America specifically, we acquired over 1.2 million new customers in the quarter, representing strong growth versus last year. And of these new customers, two-thirds were Gen Z and Millennials. We are capturing consumers who are entering the category for the first time, which is instrumental to fueling enduring relationships, customer lifetime value, and sustainable growth. New Gen Z and Millennial consumers continue to transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base, and we achieved a meaningful increase in year one retention rates among Gen Z consumers at Coach, a key indicator that these relationships are sticky. Third, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences, delighting consumers across all touch points with our brands. To this end, we maintain strength in digital, which grew at a mid-teens rate versus prior year and represented approximately 30% of revenue at accretive margins. Our global brick and mortar sales rose at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter at strong and increasing profitability. Overall, our direct to consumer operating model is a clear differentiator and competitive advantage, driving real-time consumer understanding and agility. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence as we continue to deliver creativity, quality, and compelling value to consumers around the world. This is on display at Coach, where we delivered strong and broad-based growth, highlighting the vibrancy of the brand and product offering. Our commitment to disciplined brand building is also reflected in our strong gross margin, which continued to expand in the quarter. Importantly, our globally scaled and diverse supply chain is a key competitive advantage, enabling us to deliver craftsmanship to consumers while navigating the shifting backdrop, which Scott will discuss in more detail shortly. Overall, we generated record third quarter earnings per share, which exceeded our expectations and increased 27% compared to the prior year. This outperformance positioned us to increase our outlook for the fiscal year. We're on track to deliver fiscal year 2025 earnings in the area of $5 per share, consistent with the outlook we provided nearly 3 years ago at our Investor Day, despite the rapidly changing global landscape. This is a testament to the power of our strategies, the agility of our operating model, and the resilience and focus of our teams. These advantages are driving our success today, and I'm confident they will continue to underpin our growth long term. Now moving to our results and strategies by brand. Coach delivered another standout performance with accelerated growth in the third quarter, driving 15% top line gains as the brand's expressive luxury position continues to resonate with consumers. We believe that the momentum we have unlocked is enduring and that Coach’s success is compounding. We continue to build on our strong brand and cultural relevance driven by product innovation and the creativity of our talented global teams, who are operating with excellence, focus, and intention. The Coach vision is clear to be the world's most inclusive, genuine, and loved fashion brand, and it is this vision that guides our strategies and fosters a brand purpose that cuts through with consumers. And our success is evident in our results. We are driving meaningful new Gen Z customer acquisition through our outstanding product offerings, authentic brand values, and deep understanding of our target consumer. We are winning in our core leather goods category, where we're outpacing the industry, and we're doing this on a global scale with strong top line momentum and exceptional margins, which increased nearly 100 basis points versus prior year. Now, touching on the highlights of the third quarter in more detail. First, we drove double-digit gains in leather goods where we have multiple platforms for growth. The iconic Tabby family once again led over-indexing with new and younger consumers, building strength on strength. The Tabby shoulder bag 26 continued to anchor the offering while the new Chain Tabby was a global success. Additionally, our New York family significantly outpaced expectations, cementing itself as a new growth driver for the brand, with styles ranging from the viral Brooklyn Shoulder bag 28 at $295 to the Soft Empire Carryall 40 at $695. Further, we grew our archival inspired Coach Originals collection with the introduction of the large Kiss Lock Bag at $695, which sold out within minutes of launching online and within a day at stores. And finally, our Bag Charms and Straps added to our success, providing consumers with further opportunities for self-expression with the Cherry Bag Charm remaining a Gen Z favorite. Overall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories continue to outpace the industry, a testament to the brand's heat, innovation pipeline, and the compelling value and craftsmanship we offer in the luxury market. With these advantages, we drove mid-teens handbag AUR growth led by North America. Looking ahead, we are confident in the potential for further sustainable AUR increases. Next, we remain focused on fueling footwear, which drives lifetime value with our target Gen Z consumer. In the quarter, footwear grew mid-single digits, bringing new and younger consumers to the brand. Growth in the category was led by the successful launch of the Soho sneaker and the continued momentum of the Highline sneaker. Building on our one Coach learning agenda, both sneakers are offered at consistent price points between retail and outlet channels, enabling us to amplify our innovation and big ideas with consumers. Turning to Marketing. We continue to drive cultural relevance through emotional storytelling that highlights our brand purpose and product offering. During the quarter, Coach launched On Your Own Time, a campaign introducing Coach's spring 2025 collection and starring global ambassadors Elle Fanning, Nazha, Koki, and Youngji Lee. This campaign was inspired by our ongoing discussions with Gen Z consumers across the world and shares a powerful message about having the courage to set the pace of your own life. This campaign is continuing to deliver strong uplifts and consideration and purchase intent across markets. And as we deepen our learnings with each campaign, we are strengthening both our bold storytelling and our media execution. This strategy is driving the acceleration of sustainable customer acquisition and brand growth, and it's working globally at scale. In addition, we also cultivated enthusiasm for the brand through unique and immersive retail experiences. Our Coach Play concept stores continue to outperform with higher Gen Z traffic, longer dwell times, and higher return frequency. We're taking these learnings to bring the highest impact elements of this concept to our store fleet more broadly. Overall, our holistic brand building activities help to drive increases in new customer acquisition as we welcomed nearly 900,000 new customers to Coach in North America, of which nearly 70% were Gen Z and Millennials. And at the same time, our retention rate with the Gen Z cohort also meaningfully increased, reinforcing that we're building lasting relationships with our consumers in support of durable growth. In closing, Coach is strong in delivering differentiated results by fostering emotional connections and delivering exceptional value to consumers. Powered by Tapestry's growth engine, we will continue to invest in brand building and innovation to drive long-term sustainable growth, bringing this iconic brand to new generations of consumers. Now, moving to Kate Spade. In the third quarter, revenue was pressured, declining 12% at constant currency, while profit met our expectations driven by continued gross margin expansion. As we've shared, our work to reset the brand is underway, and we're making decisions today to drive sustainable growth long term. We know this work will take time, particularly in the context of a more uncertain backdrop. However, the actions we need to take are clear, and we are executing with focus and urgency. Our strategies are informed by Tapestry's growth model with a focus on building brand heat, relevant product innovation, and compelling experiences. As we build a healthier brand, we will be closely tracking leading indicators of progress along the way, informed by our learnings and success at Coach. These include first, increasing unaided brand awareness and search interest followed by an improvement in traffic and customer acquisition, which will ultimately compound to drive top line growth. Now turning to the strategic details. First, we're committed to fueling brand heat and relevancy through cohesive storytelling and incremental investments in brand media. In April, we launched our spring campaign which featured Ice Spice and Charli D'Amelio, 2 very influential and relevant Gen Z celebrities. This is a further step toward a more effective spike and sustained marketing strategy that will enable us to reestablish Kate Spade as a top of mind brand for our target audience. Next, we continue to prioritize strengthening and elevating our handbag offering, bringing more innovation, focus, and relevancy to our assortment. We are advancing our work to build blockbuster handbag families. During the quarter, we continued to amplify the Deco collection and retail and the Kayla and Kip in outlet, which over-indexed with new younger consumers at strong AUR and margins, and we see further opportunity for these families going forward. And as we bring more innovation to the assortment, we're also working to streamline our offering by reducing handbag styles by over 15% by fall and continue to clear de-selection barriers through improved styling, ensuring our big ideas cut through with consumers. Overall, we're focused on creating distinctive product that is consumer informed, grounded in Kate Spade's unique brand DNA, and modern and relevant today. Next, we're working to maximize omnichannel cohesiveness with a compelling consistent brand message across all consumer touch points. As part of our efforts to improve the customer experience and fuel brand health, we are committed to reducing promotional activity and delivering continued gross margin expansion. As previously shared, reducing the level of promotional activity is a key building block to scale in a healthy way globally over the long term, as we build for the future and connect with consumers on our brand values beyond simply price. In closing, we are advancing our efforts to reinvigorate Kate Spade. The brand has a legacy of creativity, joy, wit, and warmth, and we will build on this unique heritage while modernizing its expression, guided by a sharpened focus on our consumer. The steps to do this will take time, but we are confident in the potential and path forward. Importantly, the strength of our platform provides us with the experience, discipline, and brand building capabilities to execute these strategies while delivering enhanced results overall. Our focus is clear, and we are committed to unlocking the untapped growth and value creation opportunities for this iconic brand. Now, turning briefly to Stuart Weitzman. As previously announced, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the brand to Caleres, and we continue to expect the transaction to close this summer, subject to customary closing conditions. As diligent stewards of our portfolio and disciplined allocators of capital, this ensures that all our brands are positioned for long-term success and that we maintain a sharp focus on our largest value creation opportunities. At the same time, we are pleased that we found Stuart Weitzman a home in Caleres, an ideal owner to guide its next chapter of growth. In closing, Tapestry delivered another standout quarter with accelerated sales and earnings growth that positioned us to increase our outlook for the year. I want to thank our extraordinary teams for driving these strong and differentiated results. Moving forward, the external backdrop has become increasingly complex. That said, in the face of uncertainty, our purpose is unwavering to stretch what's possible for our brands and business. To do this, we will harness our proven competitive and structural advantages that have allowed us to adapt and win in any environment, namely our global scale and an attractive industry. The compelling value we offer to consumers and the strong fundamentals of our business. I'm confident in our future and the meaningful opportunity to deliver durable growth and shareholder value. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Roe: Thanks Joanne and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results exceeded our outlook, building on our track record of consistent execution as we unlocked accelerated growth. We delivered record third quarter revenue and earnings per share while generating over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow year to date. Now, moving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 8% to the prior year and outperformed our expectations. These results reflect gains in North America and internationally. By region, North American sales increased 9% compared to the prior year led by strong double-digit growth at Coach. Both gross and operating margin rose versus last year as we supported long-term brand health. In Europe, revenue grew 35% above last year, with growth across all channels driven by increased local consumer spend and strong new customer acquisition, notably with Gen Z. In Greater China, growth continued with revenue rising 5%. Our sequential acceleration was driven by both digital and stores with each channel delivering growth. Our differentiated results in China clearly demonstrate that our strategic initiatives and investments in the region are yielding returns with our brands and business positioned for long-term sustainable growth. And in other Asia, revenue rose 14%, led by growth in Australia, South Korea, and Thailand, while Japan's sales declined 2%. Now, touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct to consumer business grew 9% compared to the prior year at constant currency, which included a mid-teens percentage increase in digital revenue and a mid-single digit increase in global brick and mortar sales. And wholesale revenue grew in the quarter in keeping with our expectations and strategy to find targeted opportunities to expand our brand's reach with consumers. Moving down the P&L, we delivered a gross margin of 76.1%, representing our highest quarterly gross margin in over 15 years. This was ahead of plan and 140 basis points above prior year driven by operational outperformance. Our strong gross margin performance is a core element of our value creation model, providing us with flexibility and fuel to drive long-term growth. Turning to SG&A, expenses rose 7% and were even with prior year on a rate basis. This included increased brand building investments and higher compensation costs offset by leverage on fixed costs. As compared to expectations, there was a benefit of approximately $20 million or $0.05 primarily related to marketing timing with the fourth quarter. Taken together, operating margin increased 140 basis points in the quarter, driving profit expansion ahead of expectations and 16% over the prior year. And our record third quarter EPS of $1.03 grew 27% over prior year and exceeded our guidance. Now, turning to our shareholder return programs. As previously announced, in November, we executed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which remained underway during the fiscal third quarter. In addition to the ASR program, we had $800 million remaining under our previous share repurchase authorization. Together with our dividend, which is expected at $1.40 per share for the year, we're positioned to return over $2 billion or more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2025, a testament to our strong organic business and robust cash flow generation. And now before turning to the details of the balance sheet and cash flows, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, which are unchanged. We have 2 foundational commitments. First, to invest in our brands and business to support long-term sustainable growth, and second, to return capital to shareholders via our dividend, with the goal over-time to increase the dividend at least in line with earnings to achieve our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40%. Beyond these 2 foundational commitments, our robust cash flow generation provides us with balance sheet flexibility for value creation. This includes the opportunity for share repurchase activity, which is on display this year. And finally, utilizing our rigorous forward lens framework, we consistently evaluate opportunities for strategic portfolio management. Importantly, and as previously communicated, before moving forward with any acquisitions, we will ensure Coach remains strong and Kate Spade has returned to sustainable top line growth. These clear capital allocation priorities are underpinned by our firm commitment to a solid investment grade rating and maintaining our long-term gross leverage target of below 2.5 times. Now, turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and investments, and total borrowings of $2.7 billion representing net debt of $1.6 billion. At quarter end, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.6 times. In addition, after our quarter end, we repaid our April 2025 bonds at maturity, totaling $303 million. Adjusted free cash flow for the third quarter was an inflow of $135 million and CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing were $36 million. Inventory levels at quarter end were 6% above prior year excluding $87 million of Stuart Weitzman inventory reflected in assets held for sale on our balance sheet. Our inventory continues to be current and well positioned globally and by brand in support of our growth ambition. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal 2025, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are raising our fiscal 2025 revenue, earnings and cash flow outlook. We continue to view this outlook as prudent and achievable, and we remain clear-eyed about the realities of the external environment, balanced with the opportunities we see for our business. For the fiscal year, we now expect revenue of approximately $6.95 billion representing growth of 4% versus prior year on a reported basis, including an expected currency headwind of nearly 50 basis points. Touching on sales details by region at constant currency. In North America, we now expect revenue to increase 3% to 4%. In addition, we still expect growth in Europe in the area of 30% where we are under-penetrated and have strong traction. In Greater China, we remain on track to achieve low single-digit growth over the prior year. And in other Asia, we continue to anticipate high single digit gains while in Japan we're now forecasting a mid single-digit decline. In addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points versus prior year. We anticipate gross margin expansion to drive this increase due to improvements in both AUR and AUC. Both freight and FX are still expected to have a negligible impact on gross margin changes for the full year. On SG&A, we expect expenses to increase above the pace of revenue growth driven by increased marketing expense. While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control, we continue to make deliberate growth focused investments in our strategic priorities. Moving to below the line expectations for the year, net interest expense is now expected to be approximately $25 million. The tax rate is now expected to be approximately 17.5%, and our weighted average diluted share count for the year is forecasted to be approximately 223 million shares. So taken together, we're raising our EPS guidance to be in the area of $5 representing high-teens growth compared to last year and ahead of our prior guide of $4.85 to $4.90. This guidance fully embeds all trade policies as of April 10th. Incremental tariffs are expected to have an immaterial impact on fiscal 2025 results based on the timing of our fiscal year end. Moving on, we now anticipate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and finally, we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $160 million. We anticipate about half of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations, and relocations with the balance primarily related to ongoing digital and IT investments. Touching on the shaping of the fourth quarter. To start, given the dynamic nature of the rapidly shifting market, it's important to note that our revenue trends quarter to date are in line with our Q3 results. However, while we've seen no slowdown in our business to date, we're taking a more conservative approach to the quarter to go outlook. For the quarter, we are estimating revenue to grow at a mid single-digit rate on both a reported and constant currency basis. Further, we're forecasting operating margin to be in the area of prior year, which incorporates the expectation for continued gross margin gains offset by higher SG&A costs, including the previously mentioned marketing expense timing shift from the third quarter. So taken together, we're modeling Q4 EPS to be over $0.95. Before closing, I want to provide some additional context on our business in light of tariffs and the shifting global trade landscape. First, as it relates to our supply chain, our products are primarily manufactured in Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines. These countries taken together represent 70% of our production, including Vietnam, which accounts for one-third of our total production. Conversely, we have very limited manufacturing exposure to China with less than 10% of our production in the region across all categories. This primarily includes manufacturing for jewelry and ready to wear with negligible exposure in our core leather goods category. As a point of reference, over the past 12 months, roughly $900 million of our cost of goods sold was related to product imported into the U.S. Touching on our tariff mitigation strategies, we're taking thoughtful actions to protect the compelling value, quality, and innovation we offer to consumers. To share some color, we pulled forward inventory receipts ahead of the incremental tariffs going into effect in April. In addition, we're leveraging our agile supply chain to optimize our global manufacturing footprint, minimizing our tariff exposure where possible. We have scale and long-standing relationships with our service providers, and we're actively working together to unlock efficiencies. And most importantly, I want to thank our supply chain organization. Their deep global trade expertise, operational excellence, and culture of continuous improvement allowed us to take swift action in the face of this uncertainty. Overall, while we are not immune to external factors, we're in a position of strength with structural advantages. Our fundamentals are strong, and our business has momentum with compounding growth fueled by innovation, customer acquisition, and AUR gains. In closing, we delivered another record breaking quarter highlighted by accelerated top and bottom line growth, and we raised our outlook for fiscal 2025 and are on track to achieve EPS in the area of $5 while returning over $3 billion to shareholders over the last 3 years, consistent with the target we outlined in our September 2022, Investor Day. Moving forward as we face an increasingly complex environment, we remain confident in our brands, our people, and our strategy with a differentiated and highly cash generative business model that has proven agile, resilient, and adaptive to change. We'll continue to focus on the factors within our control, operating with a commitment to discipline and consistency to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. I'd now like to open it up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, good morning everyone. Really, really strong quarter. Good to see it. I guess this very high level maybe for Joanne, what's driving it? I mean, especially at the Coach brand, I just don't think you guys have put up numbers like this in 20 years. What's driving it? And how are you thinking about the business in the future in a more dynamic environment? Can the brand sustain this kind of heat? Just kind of curious your thoughts?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, good morning Ike, and thanks. We did deliver a standout quarter, and I think one that illustrates the power of our business model and the unique strengths and structural advantages that we have to navigate in really any environment. To your point, in the quarter, we delivered accelerated top and bottom line growth that exceeded our expectations, and we did this at increasing margins, and that enabled us to raise our outlook for the year. And there are really 4 key structural advantages that we think about as we think about navigating a dynamic environment and those are also the things that helped contribute to our success to date and I would say the first is that we're building strong emotional connections with consumers and we play in a category in handbags that have proven to be durable over time because of the emotional connection that consumers have with our category. I think second is our high margins and strong cash flow and our direct to consumer model. These fundamentals insulate us from some tariff exposure, but also allow us to read demand signals sooner and allows us to react sooner and that brings in our diversified and agile supply chain. You know, this supply chain was built over decades and it's proven we've navigated disruptions in the past both on the supply side and on the demand side. And I think underpinning it all is the value that we're delivering in the global market. We are delivering incredible, exceptional innovation I can say at compelling value, and customers are responding, which helped us deliver the results from the quarter, the beat and raise for the year. And I do think it's notable that we're on track to deliver $5 in earnings per share. That's consistent with the targets that we set at our Investor Day in 2022. Our teams have done an excellent job navigating through volatility and delivering on the commitment we made 3 years ago, and that gives us confidence that we're in a position of strength, and it shows our ability to adapt and win in all environments.\nIke Boruchow: Great, congrats.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks Ike.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. It was encouraging to hear that the 2025 outlook would have an immaterial impact from tariffs. If the environment stays where it is today, can you provide some guard rails around what 2026 impacts might look like?\nScott Roe: Yeah, Lorraine, I'll take that. This is Scott. So first of all, I think you can appreciate our longstanding and consistent practice. We'll give you guidance on next year at the end of our next fiscal, which will be our fourth quarter. But there are some things I can say that might help you a little bit. First of all, remember we've taken a number of actions already to mitigate impacts of tariffs. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, but some of those are we brought some inventory in ahead of times before effective dates. We're looking at optimizing across our diverse supply chain with a very agile team that's informed by the insights of, I would say a crackerjack trade expertise that's allowing us to optimize across that diverse supply chain. And lastly, we're working with our suppliers. We have scale and we have long-standing relationships, strategic relationships with very important suppliers, and we're working collaboratively to find opportunities to mitigate the cost of any potential tariffs. But there are a few things we won't do. We'll never sacrifice innovation or quality as we think about trying to find those mitigating actions. And I also mentioned in the prepared remarks and in some of the documents that we gave you, just some ways to dimensionalize potential exposures to tariffs. So, about $900 million of cost of goods sold is related to imports into the U.S. market. So obviously, if you do simple math, a 10% incremental tariff across the board would be $90 million. Now that's unmitigated, right? That's before any of those actions that I talked about. And we've made substantial inroads already at finding mitigations against those -- any potential exposure that we might see. So, everything I've said here is related to the cost side. And if you think about gross margins, remember, independent of costs, we also have a long-standing history of AUR gains, right? So you think about mitigating the cost side, coupled with our brand building, consumer engagement and our ability to raise AURs over time, because we're delivering a more compelling value, that gives us confidence in our ability to maintain margins. Maybe, Todd, little more on the AUR side of that equation.\nTodd Kahn: Sure, Scott. Thank you. Again, one thing we don't do, we're not just looking at cost to deal with AURs, we have compelling reasons to increase AURs. And just for grounding everyone, in the last 5 years, we've been able to raise our global AURs at Coach in 18 of those quarters. That should give you a lot of confidence in what's happening at Coach. And I will say with real conviction the brand heat today is at its best in the last 5 years. We have real momentum at Coach. And you see it in a number of ways. We talk about brand heat, which is really desirability. We talk about innovation. And I'll give you 2 quick examples. In this last quarter, we had a really fantastic product in both retail and in outlet. And in outlet, we launched a collection called Powder Pink. We had lines outside our door. This is not during a Black Friday or a holiday period. This is just for a collection that we launched, and it was millions of dollars of result in literally 10 days. Similarly, with our launch at retail of our Crystal Sync collection, just compelling product. And what gives me so much future confidence is we know these results and based on the data that we see, our innovation pipeline will continue to get better and better. So, I feel very good about not only the brand heat, the innovation, the quality, but absolute value that we're offering our clients. Again, you've heard me talk about this before, but in a world where 20 years ago Coach would play and European luxury, traditional European luxury was 2x our price points. Today, they're 10x. That just gives me more and more confidence globally that our value proposition cuts through across the world. And you see that in markets like Europe and Asia, and of course, the 20% we delivered in North America.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMatthew Boss: Great, thanks and congrats on a really nice quarter. Maybe 2 parts. Joanne, if you could elaborate on the new customer acquisition that you cited. It seems like it's really driving the inflection in North America and just some of the retention metrics that you're seeing and initiatives around that. And then Todd, I wanted to circle back, maybe just forward-looking, how you see the merchandising assortment position today to take continued market share? And maybe if you could just assess the product and the relative value at Coach, maybe relative to luxury or just what you're seeing. Is it trade in? Trade down? Maybe just elaborate on the market share acceleration that you're seeing.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Sure, Matt. I'll kick it off, and I'm glad you called out new customer acquisition. This is a metric and KPI that we've been focused on from the beginning of our transformation. And I used to say new customer acquisitions is like oxygen for brands. But we've been quite intentional about going after new customer acquisition and importantly acquiring a new and younger consumer to our brands for a couple of reasons. One, it was clear that by 2030, most of the consumption in our category was going to be Gen Z and Millennials. So, we knew we had to appeal to a younger generation of consumers with all of our brands. So, we began to become more intentional about it. And we really put the consumer at the center of everything we do, and we call out new customer acquisition every quarter intentionally. And that's what everybody in our company is really focused on, how do we engage more consumers and engage them with deeper emotional connections to our brands. So that we're not just selling a bag at a price, we're connecting these consumers to our brands on an emotional level. And that's what proves to be durable over time. And the exciting thing about acquiring a young consumer is that the lifetime value opportunity is long. And we -- so we see that. But we also see young consumers influencing all age groups. So, we haven't forgotten about our entire customer mix. We love all of our customers. And when we talk about our growth, we're seeing growth across age groups, across income demographics, but our focus on acquiring a new and younger consumer is breathing a lot of life into our brands, a lot of relevance into the way our brands show up in the world. And again, because these young consumers are so connected, digitally connected across the world, honestly, they're driving choice for all generations and influencing all generations. So, that's helping us drive our brand heat. And you mentioned retention rates, we're actually beginning now, and we called it out this quarter to see these young consumers coming back with higher frequency. So the year 1 retention rate of Gen Z at Coach is going up, it's higher. And that is a great sign for us as we talk about this lifetime value and the durability of this business over time. It's a great leading indicator of what's to come for Coach. So, we have a lot of confidence in the future. And I'll pass it to Todd talking about the positioning of Coach.\nTodd Kahn: Thank you, Joanne. Just one thing on the customer. In addition to capturing these 900,000 new customers, 70%, as we noted, were Gen Z and Millennial. I believe we're bringing new customers into the category. And I think that's incredibly important. We are very focused on point of entry, because as Joanne mentioned, if you get them at point of entry, their lifetime value really increases. Now, in terms of people coming into the market that you mentioned -- I'm sorry?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: The products.\nTodd Kahn: Yes, yes, the products, sorry, our merchandising position, it's interesting. I think anybody who buys a Coach bag is buying up regardless of where they came from, because the absolute value is there. So, we're clearly taking market share across the spectrum. When the category is growing at globally 1%, let's say, and we put up -- sorry, when the category is growing in North America at about 1% and down globally, when we put up these kind of numbers, we're clearly taking market share. And I think it's coming across the board. And I'll give you one proof point that gives me a lot of confidence. We've talked about the list index, which talks about the hottest brands globally. In the holiday quarter, we moved from 15 to 5 on the list index. In the last quarter, the first calendar quarter of this year, we moved to 4. I'm not going to do an editorial for who those other brands are, but we are really one of the only American, North American-based luxury brand. That tells you a lot about the consumer behavior, because the list index not only measures sales, it measures search, it measures intent to buy and relevance, and I feel very good. And one of the things we've done the last 5 years and you've seen us do is we're focused on these big families, these big ideas, whether it's [indiscernible], whether it's Tabby, whether it's the New York family. And what that allows us to do is to keep bringing innovation in a consistent way. So, the merchandising strategy becomes very clear and very compelling for our customers. And again, I emphasized that in the first question we had, but the compelling value globally is really resonating. I said often I don't like the idea of somebody having to say 3 or 4-month salary to buy a handbag, okay, that has never been Coach's DNA. We want to make people feel confident. We want them to feel good about their purchase and buy something of true value that represents value. And I think that gives us a lot of confidence in the future.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Binetti of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nMichael Binetti: Congrats on a great quarter. Just a couple from me. On the gross margin, nice to see the beat in the quarter. As I think about the contribution, Kate Spade coming in a little above the 100 basis points for the company that you guided to, Coach a little below. Is that how you planned it? Or were there any new dynamics that enhance the Coach brand to think about? And can you talk a little bit about the Coach brand gross margin outlook from here? What's embedded in 4Q? I know Scott, you said it was operational improvements, but what's embedded in 4Q and then just the puts and takes after fiscal 2025, excluding the tariffs? I know we still have a lot to learn there. And then I guess on AURs. I know Todd gave us some thoughts through the product lines. It's very obvious, and we've all learned the lesson I'm not questioning you guys on the AUR growth here. But can you -- Scott, could you break down those drivers of the acceleration a little bit from the finance side? And I know you said there's further opportunities for expansion, but just a few thoughts on how you start to lap these 2 mid-teens AUR quarters in a row now as we think about our models after the call today, since it's taken such a nice step up in the last couple of quarters?\nScott Roe: Yes. Boy, there was a lot there Michael. I can always count on you when I hear your name [indiscernible] I know you're coming my way. So first of all, I'm not sure exactly what you were saying on the gross margin. But listen, one of the reasons for our beat versus guidance is gross margin strength, and it's all driven by operational. And a lot of that is AUR, but also AUC. Again, I would say AUC is underappreciated part of our story. So, we've been consistent in finding opportunities to find efficiency, never at the expense of quality or innovation, but we're finding AUC opportunities. But a lot of the strength is in AUR, and it's all the things that Todd just said. So, there's no magic in there. There's no big mix. There's no other extraneous things. It's solid fundamentals here. Four yards and a cloud of dust. We're continuing on AUR. And so where is it coming from? It's coming from both merchandising. It's less about like-for-like price, right? I mean there is some of that, of course, and we don't think cost plus. I hope that came through and what Todd said, right? We're looking at value and innovation. So, as we merchandise new products and new drops and new colors, and continue to refresh and update and innovate around our iconic products, we're always finding opportunities to test whether that value and innovation is working with the consumer and make sure that we have the right price value relationship. And so far, because of the brand heat and all the things that are being delivered, particularly in the Coach brand, we're seeing that there's been zero resistance from a price standpoint and we're generally using our data and analytics to find the right -- to find that right balance and make sure we don't get too greedy and also that we just have the right relationships. So, that's one of the reasons we have confidence, right? The combination of brand heat, understanding the consumer receptivity to that price value relationship and being very sensitive to that. And we think we've got that dialed in pretty good, and that gives us confidence in the future. So, I don't know if I'm answering your question. As it relates to Kate, I think Kate is a really nice story of the machine, right, in the sense of supply chain, finance, working with the brand teams to even in what we would say has been a tough backdrop from a demand and top line standpoint. We're focused on quality. This is something you've heard us say along for quite a while, not chasing the last dollar. Some of the actions we're taking honestly do even have some top line impact. But we're continuing underneath that to manage inventory well and continue to grow our gross margin. So, we look at that as an indicator or a green shoot for the future, and that's an important metric that we keep an eye on.\nTodd Kahn: Sorry, I just want to jump in, just to clarify the Coach gross margin comment you made, because my team will never forgive me if I don't. We achieved 79% gross margin this last quarter, probably the -- I believe the highest gross margin in Coach's history for the third quarter. So, we feel very good about this neighborhood that we're in, and we'll continue to be in this neighborhood.\nMichael Binetti: Great job, okay. Thanks a lot guys for all the detail.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. How are unit volumes trending at the Coach brand, both in North America and internationally? Given the strong growth in AUR that you've seen, what do you think is the right medium to long-term balance between AUR and unit growth?\nTodd Kahn: I guess I'll take that. We're bringing new clients to our business. And over time, you'll continue to see us grow units. But this AUR that we've had, we've grown so materially since I’ll take a starting point of 2019. We're behind 2019. But in 2019, our AUR was about 70% lower than it is today in North America. So, each of these interactions, as I always say, one client, one customer that we interact with. I am very pleased that we are selling less product on promotion. That's just a general truism that creates sustainable brand growth. And because of that and because of these new customers, we're going to see a -- not only AUR continue to grow, but we will start seeing units to grow as well. But again, the brand positioning is one of strength. And the fact that we are not just pumping units into the market to create sales volume gives me sustainable long-term growth.\nBrooke Roach: Great, thanks so much.\nTodd Kahn: You’re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Rick Patel of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nRick Patel: Thank you and congrats on the strong execution. Can you unpack your performance and strategy across Coach full price and outlet just given the evolving macro? How do you maintain the momentum you have while remaining nimble given consumer preferences could be subject to change in the coming months?\nTodd Kahn: Thanks for the question. It's very interesting. We've been talking a lot about our performance across the fleet. And we've talked to you a little bit about our One Coach strategy where we're putting more and more what was historically full-priced product in traditional outlets at full price, and it's resonating with the consumer. As we've seen over and over again, we want to be consumer-centric, not channel centric. And what that means is when somebody comes into a Sawgrass Mall outside of Fort Lauderdale [indiscernible], that might be the only mall they go to. It might be their best mall in the area. It might be the mall that they're visiting as a tourist. They come in knowing they want the Tabby bag. And so we're giving them that opportunity at full price across the channel. And we're extending that One Coach concept into other categories like footwear. Footwear has been something that we're very, very focused on, but not just chasing any trends in footwear. We're very focused on sneaker business. And this last quarter, we launched our Soho sneaker at $145 across all channels at one price point. It's resonating really strongly, particularly with that young consumer we're going after. So, you're going to see us blur the lines more and more across channels, because the value proposition is there. It's there. It's compelling. It's recognized by the consumer. So, I think you'll hear us talk continue to build on the momentum of this One Coach idea, and blurring the channels, again, putting that consumer at the heart of everything we do.\nRick Patel: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Dana Telsey of Telsey Group.\nDana Telsey: Congratulations on the nice progress. With the uptick in acceleration in digital and store sales that you saw this quarter, -- the marketing obviously is very effective, how do you think about marketing by channel and what you're looking at? And as you look even towards next year a little bit, remodels of stores, opening new stores, what do you see as the balance of where you're looking to show up given the competitive moat that you're building around the Coach brand?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, maybe I'll kick it off and then toss it to Todd to give you some details on Coach specifically. But I appreciate you noting that we grew in our direct channels, we think our direct business is in a competitive advantage, Dana. And we do -- we are able, through our direct business, to meet consumers wherever they are. And that includes having the strong digital capabilities as well as really compelling in-store experiences. So, we grew in both channels this quarter, strong growth in digital and growth in stores and at increasing profitability across channels. So, we think that's a competitive advantage for us and we care about the experiences that we deliver to consumers in each of those channels, making sure that those channels are fit for purpose in terms of what -- how the customer interacts with our associates, their discovery, their brand discovery, the inspiration we provide. So, we spend a lot of time on that. And you asked about our media investments. And I would say marketing overall, we talk a lot about the fact that we've increased our marketing and brand-building investments over time. I think I went back to pre-pandemic levels, we were at 3% to 4% of our sales at one time, and we're approaching 10% of our sales now invested in marketing and brand building. And as we've built the capabilities, the brand-building capabilities and the experience and expertise to drive these investments into places that are driving high returns, we are very intentional about those media investments, and where we show up with what content and based on where the customer is in their journey. And that's not something will ever be done with. This is a process of continuing to improve our execution behind our media strategies and investments. What I can say, what is on display is the compounding effect of these strategies, and you can see that at Coach, as we continue to hone those capabilities, we're seeing the compounding effect of the brand building and the brand heat we're driving at Coach. In addition to all the other things that need to come together to deliver a great customer experience, including the creativity and product and the store experience and the digital experiences. And we're investing in store experiences as well, and maybe I'll pass it to Todd, and he can share a little bit about the -- some of the excitement that's happening there.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Joanne. And one thing about the marketing, as Joanne noted, historically, Coach spends about 3%. Today, we're -- as Joanne said, we're spending 10%. But I will say over the last couple of years, we've refined our thinking. We've gotten so much better at this. We are really spending across the funnel, and we're elongating our stories to have deeper, richer stories, because to cut through. One of the things we talk a lot about is you have to create sustainability and constant messaging. So years ago, we would have new messaging every month. Today, we fundamentally do 2 campaigns annually and drive that -- over and over again. So, we talk about spike and sustain, it's something we're doing very well. In terms of the physical locations, it's very interesting. Gen Z particularly -- and maybe it's because so many of their formative years were in COVID restrictions, they love being in stores. They love experiential retail. So, you've seen us roll out some new concepts like Coach Play. You've seen us lean into food and beverage with Coach coffee shops that we started in Asia, and now we're bringing to the U.S. And you're going to see us again continue to evolve our store design to speak in an authentic way, in an approachable way to this younger consumer, but also in a luxury way. We believe in this concept of Expressive Luxury. Expressive Luxury doesn't lose sight of the luxury component of what we do, because our product -- we have fashion shows, our creative director is always thinking about new ideas, new concepts. We're not following trends, we're creating trends. So, we feel very good about where Coach is and what we'll do in the future.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Altschwager of Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Altschwager: Good morning, thank you for taking my question. First with Coach, I was hoping to get a little bit better sense of some of the regional drivers. Is it the same product that's hitting at the same time across the globe here? And then China, obviously nice momentum currently. Just how are you navigating the risk of consumers potentially souring on U.S. brands?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Maybe I'll pick up the last part of your question and start with China, and then I'll toss it to Todd for the regional -- the broader regions for Coach. But to your point, our business accelerated in Greater China in the third quarter, growing mid-single digits. We're seeing that broad-based growth, right? Growth in digital and in stores, across city tiers, and we are driving Gen Z acquisition. And I will say that's in a market, to your point, that has been in our category, pressured. Some of the numbers we see is that the market was down double digits in our category, but yet we're growing. And we're doing that because we're acquiring a new and younger consumer, and we're delivering incredible value and innovation to that consumer. And it is a discerning consumer in China, and we're seeing momentum building there. So, we continue to see China as an important region. We're confident in the long-term opportunity, and we're staying close -- importantly, staying close to consumers so that we can read and deliver what they want, what they need. And we're not seeing any signs, in our business or in our global consumer work, of pressure on anti-American sentiment. Again, we're seeing strong engagement from consumers continued new customer acquisition and we're delivering growth in China. And in China, we expect to deliver low single-digit growth for the year with continued acceleration in the fourth quarter. So, our business is on track in China. We have great teams on the ground building the business. We were just there a few weeks ago talking to the teams in the region and we feel good about the opportunities ahead. And now, I'll toss it to Todd to talk about maybe more color on China, but also what's happening in the other regions.\nTodd Kahn: Yes. Thank you, Joanne. One of, I think, the reasons we're winning is we redid our strategy on regionalization. A great bag is a great bag everywhere. And Tabby and Empire and Teri, these are winning with our target consumer because of, first, the fact that we're going after -- and we have clarity, we have a news, our creative, our marketing people are always going after the customer. And the value has been well translated across all regions. One data point that gives us confidence, Gen Z are the most homogeneous generation ever to come about. Because what they're seeing, when we put Bella Hadid and put a bag on her that looks compelling, it's compelling in Shanghai, it's compelling in Paris, it's compelling in New York and it's desirable. And what that allows us to do is take our marketing dollars instead of constantly trying to regionalize stories and spread it so thinly, we're able to concentrate. And it's a little bit of a merchandising balance, to believe that every business unit needs a 30% tail of product. So one of the things we did 5 years ago, we started to cut the tail of that special product that gives us -- that creates that beautiful Coachonomics flywheel of more gross margin, less markdown, more focused on liked product that allows us to lean in on what's winning globally. So, we feel very good about this strategy, and it is working. And it allows us to capture new customers globally.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A. I will now turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat for some concluding remarks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, I want to close by first thanking our exceptional global teams for not only delivering a standout third quarter, but for the strong results they've consistently delivered over the last 5 years. As you heard, we accelerated top and bottom line growth in the third quarter and raised our outlook for the year, showcasing the strength and resiliency of our brand and our business. And while the environment is uncertain, we are well prepared and well positioned. We have momentum, strong margins and cash flow, a flexible direct-to-consumer model and agile supply chain and we offer compelling value at global scale. These advantages are underpinning our success today, and I'm confident they will continue to drive durable growth into the future. Thank you, everyone, who joined us today for your interest in our story. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes Tapestry's earnings conference call.

I'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry’s CEO.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Good morning. Thank you Christina and welcome everyone. As noted in our press release, our record third quarter results outperformed expectations, reinforcing our position of strength. Our talented global teams drove accelerated top and bottom line growth against an increasingly complex backdrop, clearly demonstrating the power of consistent brand building and our connections with consumers around the world. Touching on the highlights of the quarter. First, we powered global growth with total revenue gains of 8% at constant currency, outpacing guidance fueled by 15% growth at Coach. By geography, international revenue rose 8%, led by an increase of 35% in Europe, where our business has strong momentum and the opportunity for continued growth is significant. In addition, we delivered a sales increase of 4% in the total APAC region. In Greater China specifically, revenue growth accelerated, rising 5% as we continue to confidently invest behind our long-term growth agenda in the region and with this important consumer cohort. And in North America, revenue increased 9% compared to last year, and gross and operating margin continued to expand, reinforcing our commitment to driving a healthy business. Second, we built new and lasting relationships with consumers around the world. In North America specifically, we acquired over 1.2 million new customers in the quarter, representing strong growth versus last year. And of these new customers, two-thirds were Gen Z and Millennials. We are capturing consumers who are entering the category for the first time, which is instrumental to fueling enduring relationships, customer lifetime value, and sustainable growth. New Gen Z and Millennial consumers continue to transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base, and we achieved a meaningful increase in year one retention rates among Gen Z consumers at Coach, a key indicator that these relationships are sticky. Third, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences, delighting consumers across all touch points with our brands. To this end, we maintain strength in digital, which grew at a mid-teens rate versus prior year and represented approximately 30% of revenue at accretive margins. Our global brick and mortar sales rose at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter at strong and increasing profitability. Overall, our direct to consumer operating model is a clear differentiator and competitive advantage, driving real-time consumer understanding and agility. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence as we continue to deliver creativity, quality, and compelling value to consumers around the world. This is on display at Coach, where we delivered strong and broad-based growth, highlighting the vibrancy of the brand and product offering. Our commitment to disciplined brand building is also reflected in our strong gross margin, which continued to expand in the quarter. Importantly, our globally scaled and diverse supply chain is a key competitive advantage, enabling us to deliver craftsmanship to consumers while navigating the shifting backdrop, which Scott will discuss in more detail shortly. Overall, we generated record third quarter earnings per share, which exceeded our expectations and increased 27% compared to the prior year. This outperformance positioned us to increase our outlook for the fiscal year. We're on track to deliver fiscal year 2025 earnings in the area of $5 per share, consistent with the outlook we provided nearly 3 years ago at our Investor Day, despite the rapidly changing global landscape. This is a testament to the power of our strategies, the agility of our operating model, and the resilience and focus of our teams. These advantages are driving our success today, and I'm confident they will continue to underpin our growth long term. Now moving to our results and strategies by brand. Coach delivered another standout performance with accelerated growth in the third quarter, driving 15% top line gains as the brand's expressive luxury position continues to resonate with consumers. We believe that the momentum we have unlocked is enduring and that Coach’s success is compounding. We continue to build on our strong brand and cultural relevance driven by product innovation and the creativity of our talented global teams, who are operating with excellence, focus, and intention. The Coach vision is clear to be the world's most inclusive, genuine, and loved fashion brand, and it is this vision that guides our strategies and fosters a brand purpose that cuts through with consumers. And our success is evident in our results. We are driving meaningful new Gen Z customer acquisition through our outstanding product offerings, authentic brand values, and deep understanding of our target consumer. We are winning in our core leather goods category, where we're outpacing the industry, and we're doing this on a global scale with strong top line momentum and exceptional margins, which increased nearly 100 basis points versus prior year. Now, touching on the highlights of the third quarter in more detail. First, we drove double-digit gains in leather goods where we have multiple platforms for growth. The iconic Tabby family once again led over-indexing with new and younger consumers, building strength on strength. The Tabby shoulder bag 26 continued to anchor the offering while the new Chain Tabby was a global success. Additionally, our New York family significantly outpaced expectations, cementing itself as a new growth driver for the brand, with styles ranging from the viral Brooklyn Shoulder bag 28 at $295 to the Soft Empire Carryall 40 at $695. Further, we grew our archival inspired Coach Originals collection with the introduction of the large Kiss Lock Bag at $695, which sold out within minutes of launching online and within a day at stores. And finally, our Bag Charms and Straps added to our success, providing consumers with further opportunities for self-expression with the Cherry Bag Charm remaining a Gen Z favorite. Overall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories continue to outpace the industry, a testament to the brand's heat, innovation pipeline, and the compelling value and craftsmanship we offer in the luxury market. With these advantages, we drove mid-teens handbag AUR growth led by North America. Looking ahead, we are confident in the potential for further sustainable AUR increases. Next, we remain focused on fueling footwear, which drives lifetime value with our target Gen Z consumer. In the quarter, footwear grew mid-single digits, bringing new and younger consumers to the brand. Growth in the category was led by the successful launch of the Soho sneaker and the continued momentum of the Highline sneaker. Building on our one Coach learning agenda, both sneakers are offered at consistent price points between retail and outlet channels, enabling us to amplify our innovation and big ideas with consumers. Turning to Marketing. We continue to drive cultural relevance through emotional storytelling that highlights our brand purpose and product offering. During the quarter, Coach launched On Your Own Time, a campaign introducing Coach's spring 2025 collection and starring global ambassadors Elle Fanning, Nazha, Koki, and Youngji Lee. This campaign was inspired by our ongoing discussions with Gen Z consumers across the world and shares a powerful message about having the courage to set the pace of your own life. This campaign is continuing to deliver strong uplifts and consideration and purchase intent across markets. And as we deepen our learnings with each campaign, we are strengthening both our bold storytelling and our media execution. This strategy is driving the acceleration of sustainable customer acquisition and brand growth, and it's working globally at scale. In addition, we also cultivated enthusiasm for the brand through unique and immersive retail experiences. Our Coach Play concept stores continue to outperform with higher Gen Z traffic, longer dwell times, and higher return frequency. We're taking these learnings to bring the highest impact elements of this concept to our store fleet more broadly. Overall, our holistic brand building activities help to drive increases in new customer acquisition as we welcomed nearly 900,000 new customers to Coach in North America, of which nearly 70% were Gen Z and Millennials. And at the same time, our retention rate with the Gen Z cohort also meaningfully increased, reinforcing that we're building lasting relationships with our consumers in support of durable growth. In closing, Coach is strong in delivering differentiated results by fostering emotional connections and delivering exceptional value to consumers. Powered by Tapestry's growth engine, we will continue to invest in brand building and innovation to drive long-term sustainable growth, bringing this iconic brand to new generations of consumers. Now, moving to Kate Spade. In the third quarter, revenue was pressured, declining 12% at constant currency, while profit met our expectations driven by continued gross margin expansion. As we've shared, our work to reset the brand is underway, and we're making decisions today to drive sustainable growth long term. We know this work will take time, particularly in the context of a more uncertain backdrop. However, the actions we need to take are clear, and we are executing with focus and urgency. Our strategies are informed by Tapestry's growth model with a focus on building brand heat, relevant product innovation, and compelling experiences. As we build a healthier brand, we will be closely tracking leading indicators of progress along the way, informed by our learnings and success at Coach. These include first, increasing unaided brand awareness and search interest followed by an improvement in traffic and customer acquisition, which will ultimately compound to drive top line growth. Now turning to the strategic details. First, we're committed to fueling brand heat and relevancy through cohesive storytelling and incremental investments in brand media. In April, we launched our spring campaign which featured Ice Spice and Charli D'Amelio, 2 very influential and relevant Gen Z celebrities. This is a further step toward a more effective spike and sustained marketing strategy that will enable us to reestablish Kate Spade as a top of mind brand for our target audience. Next, we continue to prioritize strengthening and elevating our handbag offering, bringing more innovation, focus, and relevancy to our assortment. We are advancing our work to build blockbuster handbag families. During the quarter, we continued to amplify the Deco collection and retail and the Kayla and Kip in outlet, which over-indexed with new younger consumers at strong AUR and margins, and we see further opportunity for these families going forward. And as we bring more innovation to the assortment, we're also working to streamline our offering by reducing handbag styles by over 15% by fall and continue to clear de-selection barriers through improved styling, ensuring our big ideas cut through with consumers. Overall, we're focused on creating distinctive product that is consumer informed, grounded in Kate Spade's unique brand DNA, and modern and relevant today. Next, we're working to maximize omnichannel cohesiveness with a compelling consistent brand message across all consumer touch points. As part of our efforts to improve the customer experience and fuel brand health, we are committed to reducing promotional activity and delivering continued gross margin expansion. As previously shared, reducing the level of promotional activity is a key building block to scale in a healthy way globally over the long term, as we build for the future and connect with consumers on our brand values beyond simply price. In closing, we are advancing our efforts to reinvigorate Kate Spade. The brand has a legacy of creativity, joy, wit, and warmth, and we will build on this unique heritage while modernizing its expression, guided by a sharpened focus on our consumer. The steps to do this will take time, but we are confident in the potential and path forward. Importantly, the strength of our platform provides us with the experience, discipline, and brand building capabilities to execute these strategies while delivering enhanced results overall. Our focus is clear, and we are committed to unlocking the untapped growth and value creation opportunities for this iconic brand. Now, turning briefly to Stuart Weitzman. As previously announced, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the brand to Caleres, and we continue to expect the transaction to close this summer, subject to customary closing conditions. As diligent stewards of our portfolio and disciplined allocators of capital, this ensures that all our brands are positioned for long-term success and that we maintain a sharp focus on our largest value creation opportunities. At the same time, we are pleased that we found Stuart Weitzman a home in Caleres, an ideal owner to guide its next chapter of growth. In closing, Tapestry delivered another standout quarter with accelerated sales and earnings growth that positioned us to increase our outlook for the year. I want to thank our extraordinary teams for driving these strong and differentiated results. Moving forward, the external backdrop has become increasingly complex. That said, in the face of uncertainty, our purpose is unwavering to stretch what's possible for our brands and business. To do this, we will harness our proven competitive and structural advantages that have allowed us to adapt and win in any environment, namely our global scale and an attractive industry. The compelling value we offer to consumers and the strong fundamentals of our business. I'm confident in our future and the meaningful opportunity to deliver durable growth and shareholder value. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Roe: Thanks Joanne and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results exceeded our outlook, building on our track record of consistent execution as we unlocked accelerated growth. We delivered record third quarter revenue and earnings per share while generating over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow year to date. Now, moving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 8% to the prior year and outperformed our expectations. These results reflect gains in North America and internationally. By region, North American sales increased 9% compared to the prior year led by strong double-digit growth at Coach. Both gross and operating margin rose versus last year as we supported long-term brand health. In Europe, revenue grew 35% above last year, with growth across all channels driven by increased local consumer spend and strong new customer acquisition, notably with Gen Z. In Greater China, growth continued with revenue rising 5%. Our sequential acceleration was driven by both digital and stores with each channel delivering growth. Our differentiated results in China clearly demonstrate that our strategic initiatives and investments in the region are yielding returns with our brands and business positioned for long-term sustainable growth. And in other Asia, revenue rose 14%, led by growth in Australia, South Korea, and Thailand, while Japan's sales declined 2%. Now, touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct to consumer business grew 9% compared to the prior year at constant currency, which included a mid-teens percentage increase in digital revenue and a mid-single digit increase in global brick and mortar sales. And wholesale revenue grew in the quarter in keeping with our expectations and strategy to find targeted opportunities to expand our brand's reach with consumers. Moving down the P&L, we delivered a gross margin of 76.1%, representing our highest quarterly gross margin in over 15 years. This was ahead of plan and 140 basis points above prior year driven by operational outperformance. Our strong gross margin performance is a core element of our value creation model, providing us with flexibility and fuel to drive long-term growth. Turning to SG&A, expenses rose 7% and were even with prior year on a rate basis. This included increased brand building investments and higher compensation costs offset by leverage on fixed costs. As compared to expectations, there was a benefit of approximately $20 million or $0.05 primarily related to marketing timing with the fourth quarter. Taken together, operating margin increased 140 basis points in the quarter, driving profit expansion ahead of expectations and 16% over the prior year. And our record third quarter EPS of $1.03 grew 27% over prior year and exceeded our guidance. Now, turning to our shareholder return programs. As previously announced, in November, we executed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which remained underway during the fiscal third quarter. In addition to the ASR program, we had $800 million remaining under our previous share repurchase authorization. Together with our dividend, which is expected at $1.40 per share for the year, we're positioned to return over $2 billion or more than 100% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2025, a testament to our strong organic business and robust cash flow generation. And now before turning to the details of the balance sheet and cash flows, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, which are unchanged. We have 2 foundational commitments. First, to invest in our brands and business to support long-term sustainable growth, and second, to return capital to shareholders via our dividend, with the goal over-time to increase the dividend at least in line with earnings to achieve our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40%. Beyond these 2 foundational commitments, our robust cash flow generation provides us with balance sheet flexibility for value creation. This includes the opportunity for share repurchase activity, which is on display this year. And finally, utilizing our rigorous forward lens framework, we consistently evaluate opportunities for strategic portfolio management. Importantly, and as previously communicated, before moving forward with any acquisitions, we will ensure Coach remains strong and Kate Spade has returned to sustainable top line growth. These clear capital allocation priorities are underpinned by our firm commitment to a solid investment grade rating and maintaining our long-term gross leverage target of below 2.5 times. Now, turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and investments, and total borrowings of $2.7 billion representing net debt of $1.6 billion. At quarter end, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.6 times. In addition, after our quarter end, we repaid our April 2025 bonds at maturity, totaling $303 million. Adjusted free cash flow for the third quarter was an inflow of $135 million and CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing were $36 million. Inventory levels at quarter end were 6% above prior year excluding $87 million of Stuart Weitzman inventory reflected in assets held for sale on our balance sheet. Our inventory continues to be current and well positioned globally and by brand in support of our growth ambition. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal 2025, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are raising our fiscal 2025 revenue, earnings and cash flow outlook. We continue to view this outlook as prudent and achievable, and we remain clear-eyed about the realities of the external environment, balanced with the opportunities we see for our business. For the fiscal year, we now expect revenue of approximately $6.95 billion representing growth of 4% versus prior year on a reported basis, including an expected currency headwind of nearly 50 basis points. Touching on sales details by region at constant currency. In North America, we now expect revenue to increase 3% to 4%. In addition, we still expect growth in Europe in the area of 30% where we are under-penetrated and have strong traction. In Greater China, we remain on track to achieve low single-digit growth over the prior year. And in other Asia, we continue to anticipate high single digit gains while in Japan we're now forecasting a mid single-digit decline. In addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points versus prior year. We anticipate gross margin expansion to drive this increase due to improvements in both AUR and AUC. Both freight and FX are still expected to have a negligible impact on gross margin changes for the full year. On SG&A, we expect expenses to increase above the pace of revenue growth driven by increased marketing expense. While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control, we continue to make deliberate growth focused investments in our strategic priorities. Moving to below the line expectations for the year, net interest expense is now expected to be approximately $25 million. The tax rate is now expected to be approximately 17.5%, and our weighted average diluted share count for the year is forecasted to be approximately 223 million shares. So taken together, we're raising our EPS guidance to be in the area of $5 representing high-teens growth compared to last year and ahead of our prior guide of $4.85 to $4.90. This guidance fully embeds all trade policies as of April 10th. Incremental tariffs are expected to have an immaterial impact on fiscal 2025 results based on the timing of our fiscal year end. Moving on, we now anticipate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and finally, we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $160 million. We anticipate about half of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations, and relocations with the balance primarily related to ongoing digital and IT investments. Touching on the shaping of the fourth quarter. To start, given the dynamic nature of the rapidly shifting market, it's important to note that our revenue trends quarter to date are in line with our Q3 results. However, while we've seen no slowdown in our business to date, we're taking a more conservative approach to the quarter to go outlook. For the quarter, we are estimating revenue to grow at a mid single-digit rate on both a reported and constant currency basis. Further, we're forecasting operating margin to be in the area of prior year, which incorporates the expectation for continued gross margin gains offset by higher SG&A costs, including the previously mentioned marketing expense timing shift from the third quarter. So taken together, we're modeling Q4 EPS to be over $0.95. Before closing, I want to provide some additional context on our business in light of tariffs and the shifting global trade landscape. First, as it relates to our supply chain, our products are primarily manufactured in Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines. These countries taken together represent 70% of our production, including Vietnam, which accounts for one-third of our total production. Conversely, we have very limited manufacturing exposure to China with less than 10% of our production in the region across all categories. This primarily includes manufacturing for jewelry and ready to wear with negligible exposure in our core leather goods category. As a point of reference, over the past 12 months, roughly $900 million of our cost of goods sold was related to product imported into the U.S. Touching on our tariff mitigation strategies, we're taking thoughtful actions to protect the compelling value, quality, and innovation we offer to consumers. To share some color, we pulled forward inventory receipts ahead of the incremental tariffs going into effect in April. In addition, we're leveraging our agile supply chain to optimize our global manufacturing footprint, minimizing our tariff exposure where possible. We have scale and long-standing relationships with our service providers, and we're actively working together to unlock efficiencies. And most importantly, I want to thank our supply chain organization. Their deep global trade expertise, operational excellence, and culture of continuous improvement allowed us to take swift action in the face of this uncertainty. Overall, while we are not immune to external factors, we're in a position of strength with structural advantages. Our fundamentals are strong, and our business has momentum with compounding growth fueled by innovation, customer acquisition, and AUR gains. In closing, we delivered another record breaking quarter highlighted by accelerated top and bottom line growth, and we raised our outlook for fiscal 2025 and are on track to achieve EPS in the area of $5 while returning over $3 billion to shareholders over the last 3 years, consistent with the target we outlined in our September 2022, Investor Day. Moving forward as we face an increasingly complex environment, we remain confident in our brands, our people, and our strategy with a differentiated and highly cash generative business model that has proven agile, resilient, and adaptive to change. We'll continue to focus on the factors within our control, operating with a commitment to discipline and consistency to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value. I'd now like to open it up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, good morning everyone. Really, really strong quarter. Good to see it. I guess this very high level maybe for Joanne, what's driving it? I mean, especially at the Coach brand, I just don't think you guys have put up numbers like this in 20 years. What's driving it? And how are you thinking about the business in the future in a more dynamic environment? Can the brand sustain this kind of heat? Just kind of curious your thoughts?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, good morning Ike, and thanks. We did deliver a standout quarter, and I think one that illustrates the power of our business model and the unique strengths and structural advantages that we have to navigate in really any environment. To your point, in the quarter, we delivered accelerated top and bottom line growth that exceeded our expectations, and we did this at increasing margins, and that enabled us to raise our outlook for the year. And there are really 4 key structural advantages that we think about as we think about navigating a dynamic environment and those are also the things that helped contribute to our success to date and I would say the first is that we're building strong emotional connections with consumers and we play in a category in handbags that have proven to be durable over time because of the emotional connection that consumers have with our category. I think second is our high margins and strong cash flow and our direct to consumer model. These fundamentals insulate us from some tariff exposure, but also allow us to read demand signals sooner and allows us to react sooner and that brings in our diversified and agile supply chain. You know, this supply chain was built over decades and it's proven we've navigated disruptions in the past both on the supply side and on the demand side. And I think underpinning it all is the value that we're delivering in the global market. We are delivering incredible, exceptional innovation I can say at compelling value, and customers are responding, which helped us deliver the results from the quarter, the beat and raise for the year. And I do think it's notable that we're on track to deliver $5 in earnings per share. That's consistent with the targets that we set at our Investor Day in 2022. Our teams have done an excellent job navigating through volatility and delivering on the commitment we made 3 years ago, and that gives us confidence that we're in a position of strength, and it shows our ability to adapt and win in all environments.\nIke Boruchow: Great, congrats.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks Ike.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. It was encouraging to hear that the 2025 outlook would have an immaterial impact from tariffs. If the environment stays where it is today, can you provide some guard rails around what 2026 impacts might look like?\nScott Roe: Yeah, Lorraine, I'll take that. This is Scott. So first of all, I think you can appreciate our longstanding and consistent practice. We'll give you guidance on next year at the end of our next fiscal, which will be our fourth quarter. But there are some things I can say that might help you a little bit. First of all, remember we've taken a number of actions already to mitigate impacts of tariffs. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, but some of those are we brought some inventory in ahead of times before effective dates. We're looking at optimizing across our diverse supply chain with a very agile team that's informed by the insights of, I would say a crackerjack trade expertise that's allowing us to optimize across that diverse supply chain. And lastly, we're working with our suppliers. We have scale and we have long-standing relationships, strategic relationships with very important suppliers, and we're working collaboratively to find opportunities to mitigate the cost of any potential tariffs. But there are a few things we won't do. We'll never sacrifice innovation or quality as we think about trying to find those mitigating actions. And I also mentioned in the prepared remarks and in some of the documents that we gave you, just some ways to dimensionalize potential exposures to tariffs. So, about $900 million of cost of goods sold is related to imports into the U.S. market. So obviously, if you do simple math, a 10% incremental tariff across the board would be $90 million. Now that's unmitigated, right? That's before any of those actions that I talked about. And we've made substantial inroads already at finding mitigations against those -- any potential exposure that we might see. So, everything I've said here is related to the cost side. And if you think about gross margins, remember, independent of costs, we also have a long-standing history of AUR gains, right? So you think about mitigating the cost side, coupled with our brand building, consumer engagement and our ability to raise AURs over time, because we're delivering a more compelling value, that gives us confidence in our ability to maintain margins. Maybe, Todd, little more on the AUR side of that equation.\nTodd Kahn: Sure, Scott. Thank you. Again, one thing we don't do, we're not just looking at cost to deal with AURs, we have compelling reasons to increase AURs. And just for grounding everyone, in the last 5 years, we've been able to raise our global AURs at Coach in 18 of those quarters. That should give you a lot of confidence in what's happening at Coach. And I will say with real conviction the brand heat today is at its best in the last 5 years. We have real momentum at Coach. And you see it in a number of ways. We talk about brand heat, which is really desirability. We talk about innovation. And I'll give you 2 quick examples. In this last quarter, we had a really fantastic product in both retail and in outlet. And in outlet, we launched a collection called Powder Pink. We had lines outside our door. This is not during a Black Friday or a holiday period. This is just for a collection that we launched, and it was millions of dollars of result in literally 10 days. Similarly, with our launch at retail of our Crystal Sync collection, just compelling product. And what gives me so much future confidence is we know these results and based on the data that we see, our innovation pipeline will continue to get better and better. So, I feel very good about not only the brand heat, the innovation, the quality, but absolute value that we're offering our clients. Again, you've heard me talk about this before, but in a world where 20 years ago Coach would play and European luxury, traditional European luxury was 2x our price points. Today, they're 10x. That just gives me more and more confidence globally that our value proposition cuts through across the world. And you see that in markets like Europe and Asia, and of course, the 20% we delivered in North America.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMatthew Boss: Great, thanks and congrats on a really nice quarter. Maybe 2 parts. Joanne, if you could elaborate on the new customer acquisition that you cited. It seems like it's really driving the inflection in North America and just some of the retention metrics that you're seeing and initiatives around that. And then Todd, I wanted to circle back, maybe just forward-looking, how you see the merchandising assortment position today to take continued market share? And maybe if you could just assess the product and the relative value at Coach, maybe relative to luxury or just what you're seeing. Is it trade in? Trade down? Maybe just elaborate on the market share acceleration that you're seeing.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Sure, Matt. I'll kick it off, and I'm glad you called out new customer acquisition. This is a metric and KPI that we've been focused on from the beginning of our transformation. And I used to say new customer acquisitions is like oxygen for brands. But we've been quite intentional about going after new customer acquisition and importantly acquiring a new and younger consumer to our brands for a couple of reasons. One, it was clear that by 2030, most of the consumption in our category was going to be Gen Z and Millennials. So, we knew we had to appeal to a younger generation of consumers with all of our brands. So, we began to become more intentional about it. And we really put the consumer at the center of everything we do, and we call out new customer acquisition every quarter intentionally. And that's what everybody in our company is really focused on, how do we engage more consumers and engage them with deeper emotional connections to our brands. So that we're not just selling a bag at a price, we're connecting these consumers to our brands on an emotional level. And that's what proves to be durable over time. And the exciting thing about acquiring a young consumer is that the lifetime value opportunity is long. And we -- so we see that. But we also see young consumers influencing all age groups. So, we haven't forgotten about our entire customer mix. We love all of our customers. And when we talk about our growth, we're seeing growth across age groups, across income demographics, but our focus on acquiring a new and younger consumer is breathing a lot of life into our brands, a lot of relevance into the way our brands show up in the world. And again, because these young consumers are so connected, digitally connected across the world, honestly, they're driving choice for all generations and influencing all generations. So, that's helping us drive our brand heat. And you mentioned retention rates, we're actually beginning now, and we called it out this quarter to see these young consumers coming back with higher frequency. So the year 1 retention rate of Gen Z at Coach is going up, it's higher. And that is a great sign for us as we talk about this lifetime value and the durability of this business over time. It's a great leading indicator of what's to come for Coach. So, we have a lot of confidence in the future. And I'll pass it to Todd talking about the positioning of Coach.\nTodd Kahn: Thank you, Joanne. Just one thing on the customer. In addition to capturing these 900,000 new customers, 70%, as we noted, were Gen Z and Millennial. I believe we're bringing new customers into the category. And I think that's incredibly important. We are very focused on point of entry, because as Joanne mentioned, if you get them at point of entry, their lifetime value really increases. Now, in terms of people coming into the market that you mentioned -- I'm sorry?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: The products.\nTodd Kahn: Yes, yes, the products, sorry, our merchandising position, it's interesting. I think anybody who buys a Coach bag is buying up regardless of where they came from, because the absolute value is there. So, we're clearly taking market share across the spectrum. When the category is growing at globally 1%, let's say, and we put up -- sorry, when the category is growing in North America at about 1% and down globally, when we put up these kind of numbers, we're clearly taking market share. And I think it's coming across the board. And I'll give you one proof point that gives me a lot of confidence. We've talked about the list index, which talks about the hottest brands globally. In the holiday quarter, we moved from 15 to 5 on the list index. In the last quarter, the first calendar quarter of this year, we moved to 4. I'm not going to do an editorial for who those other brands are, but we are really one of the only American, North American-based luxury brand. That tells you a lot about the consumer behavior, because the list index not only measures sales, it measures search, it measures intent to buy and relevance, and I feel very good. And one of the things we've done the last 5 years and you've seen us do is we're focused on these big families, these big ideas, whether it's [indiscernible], whether it's Tabby, whether it's the New York family. And what that allows us to do is to keep bringing innovation in a consistent way. So, the merchandising strategy becomes very clear and very compelling for our customers. And again, I emphasized that in the first question we had, but the compelling value globally is really resonating. I said often I don't like the idea of somebody having to say 3 or 4-month salary to buy a handbag, okay, that has never been Coach's DNA. We want to make people feel confident. We want them to feel good about their purchase and buy something of true value that represents value. And I think that gives us a lot of confidence in the future.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Binetti of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nMichael Binetti: Congrats on a great quarter. Just a couple from me. On the gross margin, nice to see the beat in the quarter. As I think about the contribution, Kate Spade coming in a little above the 100 basis points for the company that you guided to, Coach a little below. Is that how you planned it? Or were there any new dynamics that enhance the Coach brand to think about? And can you talk a little bit about the Coach brand gross margin outlook from here? What's embedded in 4Q? I know Scott, you said it was operational improvements, but what's embedded in 4Q and then just the puts and takes after fiscal 2025, excluding the tariffs? I know we still have a lot to learn there. And then I guess on AURs. I know Todd gave us some thoughts through the product lines. It's very obvious, and we've all learned the lesson I'm not questioning you guys on the AUR growth here. But can you -- Scott, could you break down those drivers of the acceleration a little bit from the finance side? And I know you said there's further opportunities for expansion, but just a few thoughts on how you start to lap these 2 mid-teens AUR quarters in a row now as we think about our models after the call today, since it's taken such a nice step up in the last couple of quarters?\nScott Roe: Yes. Boy, there was a lot there Michael. I can always count on you when I hear your name [indiscernible] I know you're coming my way. So first of all, I'm not sure exactly what you were saying on the gross margin. But listen, one of the reasons for our beat versus guidance is gross margin strength, and it's all driven by operational. And a lot of that is AUR, but also AUC. Again, I would say AUC is underappreciated part of our story. So, we've been consistent in finding opportunities to find efficiency, never at the expense of quality or innovation, but we're finding AUC opportunities. But a lot of the strength is in AUR, and it's all the things that Todd just said. So, there's no magic in there. There's no big mix. There's no other extraneous things. It's solid fundamentals here. Four yards and a cloud of dust. We're continuing on AUR. And so where is it coming from? It's coming from both merchandising. It's less about like-for-like price, right? I mean there is some of that, of course, and we don't think cost plus. I hope that came through and what Todd said, right? We're looking at value and innovation. So, as we merchandise new products and new drops and new colors, and continue to refresh and update and innovate around our iconic products, we're always finding opportunities to test whether that value and innovation is working with the consumer and make sure that we have the right price value relationship. And so far, because of the brand heat and all the things that are being delivered, particularly in the Coach brand, we're seeing that there's been zero resistance from a price standpoint and we're generally using our data and analytics to find the right -- to find that right balance and make sure we don't get too greedy and also that we just have the right relationships. So, that's one of the reasons we have confidence, right? The combination of brand heat, understanding the consumer receptivity to that price value relationship and being very sensitive to that. And we think we've got that dialed in pretty good, and that gives us confidence in the future. So, I don't know if I'm answering your question. As it relates to Kate, I think Kate is a really nice story of the machine, right, in the sense of supply chain, finance, working with the brand teams to even in what we would say has been a tough backdrop from a demand and top line standpoint. We're focused on quality. This is something you've heard us say along for quite a while, not chasing the last dollar. Some of the actions we're taking honestly do even have some top line impact. But we're continuing underneath that to manage inventory well and continue to grow our gross margin. So, we look at that as an indicator or a green shoot for the future, and that's an important metric that we keep an eye on.\nTodd Kahn: Sorry, I just want to jump in, just to clarify the Coach gross margin comment you made, because my team will never forgive me if I don't. We achieved 79% gross margin this last quarter, probably the -- I believe the highest gross margin in Coach's history for the third quarter. So, we feel very good about this neighborhood that we're in, and we'll continue to be in this neighborhood.\nMichael Binetti: Great job, okay. Thanks a lot guys for all the detail.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. How are unit volumes trending at the Coach brand, both in North America and internationally? Given the strong growth in AUR that you've seen, what do you think is the right medium to long-term balance between AUR and unit growth?\nTodd Kahn: I guess I'll take that. We're bringing new clients to our business. And over time, you'll continue to see us grow units. But this AUR that we've had, we've grown so materially since I’ll take a starting point of 2019. We're behind 2019. But in 2019, our AUR was about 70% lower than it is today in North America. So, each of these interactions, as I always say, one client, one customer that we interact with. I am very pleased that we are selling less product on promotion. That's just a general truism that creates sustainable brand growth. And because of that and because of these new customers, we're going to see a -- not only AUR continue to grow, but we will start seeing units to grow as well. But again, the brand positioning is one of strength. And the fact that we are not just pumping units into the market to create sales volume gives me sustainable long-term growth.\nBrooke Roach: Great, thanks so much.\nTodd Kahn: You’re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Rick Patel of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nRick Patel: Thank you and congrats on the strong execution. Can you unpack your performance and strategy across Coach full price and outlet just given the evolving macro? How do you maintain the momentum you have while remaining nimble given consumer preferences could be subject to change in the coming months?\nTodd Kahn: Thanks for the question. It's very interesting. We've been talking a lot about our performance across the fleet. And we've talked to you a little bit about our One Coach strategy where we're putting more and more what was historically full-priced product in traditional outlets at full price, and it's resonating with the consumer. As we've seen over and over again, we want to be consumer-centric, not channel centric. And what that means is when somebody comes into a Sawgrass Mall outside of Fort Lauderdale [indiscernible], that might be the only mall they go to. It might be their best mall in the area. It might be the mall that they're visiting as a tourist. They come in knowing they want the Tabby bag. And so we're giving them that opportunity at full price across the channel. And we're extending that One Coach concept into other categories like footwear. Footwear has been something that we're very, very focused on, but not just chasing any trends in footwear. We're very focused on sneaker business. And this last quarter, we launched our Soho sneaker at $145 across all channels at one price point. It's resonating really strongly, particularly with that young consumer we're going after. So, you're going to see us blur the lines more and more across channels, because the value proposition is there. It's there. It's compelling. It's recognized by the consumer. So, I think you'll hear us talk continue to build on the momentum of this One Coach idea, and blurring the channels, again, putting that consumer at the heart of everything we do.\nRick Patel: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Dana Telsey of Telsey Group.\nDana Telsey: Congratulations on the nice progress. With the uptick in acceleration in digital and store sales that you saw this quarter, -- the marketing obviously is very effective, how do you think about marketing by channel and what you're looking at? And as you look even towards next year a little bit, remodels of stores, opening new stores, what do you see as the balance of where you're looking to show up given the competitive moat that you're building around the Coach brand?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, maybe I'll kick it off and then toss it to Todd to give you some details on Coach specifically. But I appreciate you noting that we grew in our direct channels, we think our direct business is in a competitive advantage, Dana. And we do -- we are able, through our direct business, to meet consumers wherever they are. And that includes having the strong digital capabilities as well as really compelling in-store experiences. So, we grew in both channels this quarter, strong growth in digital and growth in stores and at increasing profitability across channels. So, we think that's a competitive advantage for us and we care about the experiences that we deliver to consumers in each of those channels, making sure that those channels are fit for purpose in terms of what -- how the customer interacts with our associates, their discovery, their brand discovery, the inspiration we provide. So, we spend a lot of time on that. And you asked about our media investments. And I would say marketing overall, we talk a lot about the fact that we've increased our marketing and brand-building investments over time. I think I went back to pre-pandemic levels, we were at 3% to 4% of our sales at one time, and we're approaching 10% of our sales now invested in marketing and brand building. And as we've built the capabilities, the brand-building capabilities and the experience and expertise to drive these investments into places that are driving high returns, we are very intentional about those media investments, and where we show up with what content and based on where the customer is in their journey. And that's not something will ever be done with. This is a process of continuing to improve our execution behind our media strategies and investments. What I can say, what is on display is the compounding effect of these strategies, and you can see that at Coach, as we continue to hone those capabilities, we're seeing the compounding effect of the brand building and the brand heat we're driving at Coach. In addition to all the other things that need to come together to deliver a great customer experience, including the creativity and product and the store experience and the digital experiences. And we're investing in store experiences as well, and maybe I'll pass it to Todd, and he can share a little bit about the -- some of the excitement that's happening there.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Joanne. And one thing about the marketing, as Joanne noted, historically, Coach spends about 3%. Today, we're -- as Joanne said, we're spending 10%. But I will say over the last couple of years, we've refined our thinking. We've gotten so much better at this. We are really spending across the funnel, and we're elongating our stories to have deeper, richer stories, because to cut through. One of the things we talk a lot about is you have to create sustainability and constant messaging. So years ago, we would have new messaging every month. Today, we fundamentally do 2 campaigns annually and drive that -- over and over again. So, we talk about spike and sustain, it's something we're doing very well. In terms of the physical locations, it's very interesting. Gen Z particularly -- and maybe it's because so many of their formative years were in COVID restrictions, they love being in stores. They love experiential retail. So, you've seen us roll out some new concepts like Coach Play. You've seen us lean into food and beverage with Coach coffee shops that we started in Asia, and now we're bringing to the U.S. And you're going to see us again continue to evolve our store design to speak in an authentic way, in an approachable way to this younger consumer, but also in a luxury way. We believe in this concept of Expressive Luxury. Expressive Luxury doesn't lose sight of the luxury component of what we do, because our product -- we have fashion shows, our creative director is always thinking about new ideas, new concepts. We're not following trends, we're creating trends. So, we feel very good about where Coach is and what we'll do in the future.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Altschwager of Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Altschwager: Good morning, thank you for taking my question. First with Coach, I was hoping to get a little bit better sense of some of the regional drivers. Is it the same product that's hitting at the same time across the globe here? And then China, obviously nice momentum currently. Just how are you navigating the risk of consumers potentially souring on U.S. brands?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Maybe I'll pick up the last part of your question and start with China, and then I'll toss it to Todd for the regional -- the broader regions for Coach. But to your point, our business accelerated in Greater China in the third quarter, growing mid-single digits. We're seeing that broad-based growth, right? Growth in digital and in stores, across city tiers, and we are driving Gen Z acquisition. And I will say that's in a market, to your point, that has been in our category, pressured. Some of the numbers we see is that the market was down double digits in our category, but yet we're growing. And we're doing that because we're acquiring a new and younger consumer, and we're delivering incredible value and innovation to that consumer. And it is a discerning consumer in China, and we're seeing momentum building there. So, we continue to see China as an important region. We're confident in the long-term opportunity, and we're staying close -- importantly, staying close to consumers so that we can read and deliver what they want, what they need. And we're not seeing any signs, in our business or in our global consumer work, of pressure on anti-American sentiment. Again, we're seeing strong engagement from consumers continued new customer acquisition and we're delivering growth in China. And in China, we expect to deliver low single-digit growth for the year with continued acceleration in the fourth quarter. So, our business is on track in China. We have great teams on the ground building the business. We were just there a few weeks ago talking to the teams in the region and we feel good about the opportunities ahead. And now, I'll toss it to Todd to talk about maybe more color on China, but also what's happening in the other regions.\nTodd Kahn: Yes. Thank you, Joanne. One of, I think, the reasons we're winning is we redid our strategy on regionalization. A great bag is a great bag everywhere. And Tabby and Empire and Teri, these are winning with our target consumer because of, first, the fact that we're going after -- and we have clarity, we have a news, our creative, our marketing people are always going after the customer. And the value has been well translated across all regions. One data point that gives us confidence, Gen Z are the most homogeneous generation ever to come about. Because what they're seeing, when we put Bella Hadid and put a bag on her that looks compelling, it's compelling in Shanghai, it's compelling in Paris, it's compelling in New York and it's desirable. And what that allows us to do is take our marketing dollars instead of constantly trying to regionalize stories and spread it so thinly, we're able to concentrate. And it's a little bit of a merchandising balance, to believe that every business unit needs a 30% tail of product. So one of the things we did 5 years ago, we started to cut the tail of that special product that gives us -- that creates that beautiful Coachonomics flywheel of more gross margin, less markdown, more focused on liked product that allows us to lean in on what's winning globally. So, we feel very good about this strategy, and it is working. And it allows us to capture new customers globally.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A. I will now turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat for some concluding remarks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, I want to close by first thanking our exceptional global teams for not only delivering a standout third quarter, but for the strong results they've consistently delivered over the last 5 years. As you heard, we accelerated top and bottom line growth in the third quarter and raised our outlook for the year, showcasing the strength and resiliency of our brand and our business. And while the environment is uncertain, we are well prepared and well positioned. We have momentum, strong margins and cash flow, a flexible direct-to-consumer model and agile supply chain and we offer compelling value at global scale. These advantages are underpinning our success today, and I'm confident they will continue to drive durable growth into the future. Thank you, everyone, who joined us today for your interest in our story. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes Tapestry's earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

As noted in our press release, our strong second quarter results outperformed expectations showcasing our commitment to disciplined brand building. Our exceptional teams brought innovation and craftsmanship to consumers around the world this holiday season, driving accelerated top and bottom line growth to achieve record quarterly revenue and earnings per share. From this position of strength, we increased our outlook for fiscal year 2025 while making strategic investments to extend our competitive advantages and fuel strong, durable growth and value creation into the future. Touching on the highlights of the quarter. First, we powered global growth with total revenue gains of 5% outpacing guidance. Fueled by 10% growth at Coach, by geography, all regions exceeded expectations. International revenue rose 7% at constant currency, led by an increase of 42% in Europe, where our business is strong and our runway for growth is significant. In addition, we delivered a sales increase of 1% in the total APAC region. In Greater China specifically, we returned to growth with revenue rising 2%. Importantly, we continue to bring compelling innovation, relevance, and value to consumers with a sharp focus driving long-term growth in the region and with this important consumer cohort. And in North America, revenue increased 4% compared to last year, while gross and operating margin expanded as we continue to drive a healthy business. Second, we remained focused on building new and lasting relationships with consumers. During the quarter, we drove new customer acquisition growth, welcoming approximately 2.7 million new customers in North America alone. Over half of these customers were Gen Z and millennials. And they continue to transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. Importantly, Gen Z consumers at Coach have the highest retention rate of all cohorts, reinforcing the opportunity to build lifetime value with our target consumer base. At the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America, highlighting our ability to successfully engage our existing customer base as we recruit new consumers to our brands. Third, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences underpinned by Tapestry's leading capabilities which enable us to enhance the customer experience across all touchpoints with our brands. To this end, we maintained strength in digital, which grew high single digits versus prior year and represented approximately one-third of revenue at accretive margins. Our global brick and mortar sales rose at a low single-digit rate in the quarter at strong and increasing profitability. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence. As we remain focused on bringing creativity, quality, and compelling value to consumers around the world, this is clearly on display at Coach where we delivered strong and broad-based growth in handbags with AUR gains. Underscoring the vibrancy of the brand and product offering. Our success is also reflected in our strong gross margin, as we achieved a record second quarter gross margin with further opportunity for expansion long term. Importantly, underpinning our innovation pipeline and margin gains is our agile supply chain. A key competitive advantage which enables us to deliver craftsmanship globally and powers our growth. Overall, we generated record earnings per share which exceeded our expectations and increased over 20% compared to the prior year. Importantly, our business is strong today and well-positioned for the future as we remain committed to delivering consistent long-term growth and shareholder value. Now moving to our results and strategies by brand. Coach had a breakout quarter as we continue to drive brand heat, and bring this storied brand to a new generation of consumers. Coach's success is compounding. And it demonstrates the enduring power of its expressive luxury positioning. Our growth is credit to our talented global teams who are operating with excellence and intention to deliver innovation across products, marketing, and experiences to cultivate emotional and lasting connections with consumers. To this end, during the quarter, we achieved 10% constant currency revenue gains at exceptional margins highlighted by 270 basis points of gross margin expansion and a 210 basis point lift in operating margin. Importantly, our strategies are working with three key areas underpinning our accelerated growth. First, new Gen Z customer acquisition resulting from our systematic understanding and engagement with our target consumer. Second, strength in our core leather goods category where we have authenticity and scale and our innovation is winning. Third, global outperformance led by North America and Europe and a return to growth in Greater China. These growth pillars will continue to drive our success in the future. Now touching on the strategic highlights of the second quarter in more detail. First, our results were driven by strong gains in leather goods, where we have multiple platforms for growth, given the power of our iconic handbag families and the success of new product introductions. The Tabby family once again outperformed over indexing with new and younger consumers and doubling versus last year. Building strength on strength the Tabby shoulder bag 26 continued to anchor the offering, with momentum in core Tabby, as well as new introductions, including the Times Square and Quilted Tabby. In addition, the recently launched New York family significantly outpaced expectations featuring the Brooklyn and Empire bags. During the quarter, the Brooklyn shoulder bag 28 at $295 was a top recruitment driver. While the soft Empire Carryall 40 at $695 outperformed. The New York family, a new foundation for the brand, continue to prove incremental and compelling. Providing innovation that's clearly resonating with consumers globally. Further, our Coach Originals collection featuring archival bags that celebrate the brand's legacy with a modern sensibility drove growth, notably with Gen Z consumers. And finally, bag charms and straps amplified our offerings, particularly the viral cherry charm cutting through for being emotional, highly giftable, and trend-right. Importantly, our strategies are driving strong brand heat and desire among Gen Z consumers. In fact, Coach was again recognized by The List climbing ten places to become the world's fifth hottest brand with the Brooklyn bag leading as this quarter's hottest product. Additionally, the Coach cherry bag charm entered the list as the number four hottest product. Overall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories continued to outpace the industry. Which included mid-teens AUR gains globally, led by North America. And looking forward, we remain confident in the opportunity for further sustainable growth given our brand strength and innovation pipeline as well as the compelling value and craftsmanship we offer in the luxury market. Next, we remain focused on fueling life with an emphasis on footwear. Where we are underpenetrated and have a right to win by leveraging our brand strength to drive customer recruitment, frequency, and lifetime value with our target, timeless, Gen Z consumer. During the quarter, we successfully launched the new Highline sneaker, which sold at $125 in both retail and outlet. Attracted new customers to the brand. This introduction in both retail and outlet channels builds on our one Coach learning agenda, which we successfully piloted with Tabby. Turning to marketing. We continue to drive cultural relevance through emotional storytelling that amplifies our brand and product offering. This holiday, we rolled out the next chapter of our Unlock Your Courage Campaign. And with each campaign, we're learning. Gaining deeper consumer insights that enhance our storytelling and media. This capability enables us to deliver the right content at the right time on the right platform ensuring that our messages are cutting through. This is key to driving sustainable customer acquisition and it's working globally at scale. To this end, during the quarter, we continued to increase our top of funnel marketing investments. Demonstrating the confidence we have in our brand and product offering. As a result, this helped drive greater consumer engagement and outperformance versus the industry. Particularly in our key markets of North America and China. In addition, we also cultivated enthusiasm for the brand, through unique and immersive retail experiences. Our Coach Play concept stores, which engage consumers across their five senses, continue to outperform with higher Gen Z traffic, longer dwell times, and higher return frequency. We are taking these learnings and evaluating opportunities to bring the highest impact elements of these locations to our store fleet more broadly. Overall, our holistic brand building activities helped to drive increases in new customer acquisition as we welcomed over 1.7 million new customers to Coach in North America, a strong increase versus prior year and a significant acceleration in trend. Of these new customers, nearly 60% were Gen Z and millennials. Consistent with our strategy to recruit younger customers. At the same time, our retention rate with the Gen Z cohort also increased reinforcing that we're building lasting relationships with our consumers in support of durable growth. In closing, Coach, our largest brand, is strong and differentiated. And it continues to deliver outstanding results highlighting the capabilities of Tapestry's growth engine. With consumer understanding at the center of all we do, our talented teams are delivering the blend of magic and logic that is the hallmark of the brand and the foundation of our future. From this position of strength, I'm confident our best days are still to come with significant opportunity to drive continued consistent long-term growth. Now moving to Kate Spade. While profit results met our expectations for the quarter, driven by gross margin expansion. Revenue trends declined 10%. Most importantly, together with Eva Erdman, Kate Spade's new CEO, we are moving quickly and decisively, addressing what we know is not working and laying the groundwork for a return to sustainable profitable growth. Since Eva's arrival in October, we've assessed the current state of the business and made progress in building our roadmap for the future. Informed by deeper consumer insights. The takeaway of this work is clear. We need to rebuild the brand with consumers to reignite growth. To do this, we must focus our execution and accelerate our investments. With clear priorities distorted to our largest opportunities developing emotional storytelling to fuel customer acquisition, building handbag icons and driving growth in North America, our home market. And we see the path forward as having two important stages, first, we will streamline and solidify our foundation. By editing for focus, and investing to build brand heat. This will ultimately drive customer acquisition, which will allow us to scale from a healthy foundation, which is the prerequisite for sustainable top line growth. While we are acting with urgency, we acknowledge the work to reset the brand is a multi-quarter journey. Having said that, we know the path to growth is within our control and I am confident in the plan we've developed and the significant opportunity ahead for the brand. Now let me take you through our growth strategies and learnings in more detail, which includes results from the quarter. First, we're committed to fueling brand heat. Through relevant marketing to drive consideration and accelerate customer acquisition. During the quarter, we took a step forward in our brand building efforts. And this began with streamlining. In the fall, we made the decision to reduce spending on our fall campaign based on consumer feedback during testing. Instead, we pivoted, working with speed and agility to create new, more compelling content. And in December, we launched our holiday campaign. This was a social-first campaign featuring Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Madison Beer. Consistent with our strategy to distort our marketing investments, into upper funnel campaigns with more relevant messages for our target consumer. Importantly, the tagline to the one who was pulled through creative activations on social media and in our stores. Following the campaign, we saw a significant increase in purchase intent among Gen Z consumers who engaged with the content. Reinforcing the opportunity to make incremental marketing investments to drive consideration and ultimately new customer acquisition. As a result, we are extending our brand campaign in the third quarter to sustain and amplify engagement with consumers. Importantly, our learnings will be used to inform our bigger picture efforts as we build towards a larger purpose-driven 360-degree campaign launch in the fall of 2025. Next, we are focused on sharpening and elevating our handbag offering, improving our to drive more relevancy in our assortment. In support of this ambition, we leveraged our consumer survey work which illuminated the need to streamline our offering. Clearing deselection barriers through a tighter assortment and improved styling. By simplifying our product stories and focusing our merchandising efforts, we will ensure that the big ideas in leather goods cut through with more cohesion and relevancy. With this effort, we expect to reduce the number of handbag styles by over 15% by fall. At the same time, we will work to build blockbuster handbag families informed by consumer understanding. And we have learnings from holiday. We stood firmly behind the recently launched Deco Collection and our stores and in our marketing. The Deco collection continues to over-index with new younger consumers at strong AUR and margins. We see further opportunity for this family going forward. Importantly, we know when it's rise thirty years ago, Kate Spade offered a pioneering proposition in the market along with distinctive iconic. And this is our aim today. To build on what made us unique and successful historically in a way that is modern and relevant to our consumers today. Next, are focused on maximizing omnichannel cohesiveness with one brand message across all consumer touchpoints. Importantly, we are taking steps to reduce our promotional messaging across channels. The results of the last quarter reinforce that emotion and newness are what's winning with consumers. While promotional activity is not. Therefore, decreasing our level of promotional activity will be a key building block of solidifying our brand and positioning it to scale in a healthy way. Globally over the long term. To this end, we expect our gross margin to continue to expand moving forward as we build for the future and connect consumers on our brand values, beyond simply price. In closing, we are focused on executing our strategic roadmap for durable growth, and we are accelerating our investments to do this. We acknowledge that our strategic actions will pressure the brand's near-term financial results. However, the strength of our portfolio allows us to do this while delivering enhanced growth overall. Importantly, we have conviction that we are taking the right steps to reset the brand and unlock its full potential. Kate Spade is a beloved, unique, and purpose-driven brand. And though there is significant work to do to enhance its relevancy and reconnect with consumers, the strategy to deliver this outcome is well understood and in our control. We are confident in the meaningful long-term runway for the brand the value creation opportunity it represents for Tapestry. Now turning to Stuart Weitzman. Financial results remain challenged in the quarter with net sales decreasing 16% versus prior year at constant currency. Primarily reflecting softness in Greater China and in North America direct channels. In addition, global wholesale net sales declined impacted by shipment timing, while trends at POS remained strong growing at over 20% a key indicator of strategic progress. Overall, the Stuart Weitzman team remains focused on fueling brand relevancy, driving customer engagement, and delivering improved financial results long term. In closing, Tapestry delivered a standout holiday quarter. I want to thank our teams once again for their passion, creativity, and commitment to brand building and for driving our strong results. From this position of strength, we raised our outlook for the year with a sharp focus on the path forward. We will continue to fuel momentum at Coach. While taking action to reset the Kate Spade brand for long-term growth. We are confident that our bold growth agenda will support meaningful value creation, and we look forward to sharing the details of our long-term roadmap at an investor day this fall. Our future is bright. And we have the ambition, discipline, and strategies to generate strong and durable growth and shareholder returns for years to come. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Roe: Thanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results exceeded expectations. Building on our track record of consistent execution as we unlocked accelerated growth, in the quarter, we delivered record quarterly revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share, while generating significant free cash flow. Now moving to the details of the quarter beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 5% compared to the prior year and outperformed our guidance across all regions. These results reflect gains in Europe, North America, and total APAC with international revenue growing 7%. By region, Europe revenue grew 42% above last year with growth across all brands and channels driven by increased local consumer spend, and strong new customer acquisition, notably with Gen Z. In Greater China, revenue inflected to growth of 2%. Our sequential acceleration was driven by a return to growth in our brick and mortar channel, led by an improvement in traffic, while trends in digital remained positive. Our differentiated results in China clearly demonstrate that our strategic initiatives and investments in the region are yielding returns. Positioning our brands and business for long-term sustainable growth. And in other Asia, revenue rose 11% led by growth in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Malaysia, while Japan sales declined 5%. In North America, sales increased 4% compared to the prior year, led by double-digit growth at Coach. Importantly, total gross and operating margin rose versus last year. Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 4% compared to the prior year, which included a high single-digit increase in digital revenue, and a low single-digit increase in global brick and mortar sales. And wholesale revenue grew in the quarter, in keeping with our expectations and strategy to find targeted opportunities to expand our brand's reach with consumers. Moving down the P&L, we delivered a record second quarter gross margin which was well ahead of plan and 280 basis points above prior year. This year-over-year expansion was driven by 260 basis points of operational outperformance as well as a benefit of approximately 20 basis points from lower freight expense. Our strong gross margin performance remains a core element of our value creation model providing us with flexibility and fuel to accelerate investments and drive long-term growth. Turning to SG&A, which rose 7% led by higher marketing spend versus prior year and forecast as we reinvested a portion of our profit outperformance into incremental brand building activities via top of funnel activations. Taken together, operating margin increased approximately 210 basis points in the quarter driving profit growth ahead of expectations and 15% over the prior year. At our record second quarter EPS of $2 grew 23% over prior year and exceeded our guidance by more than $0.30. To provide context on this beat, approximately $0.17 of the upside was due to operational outperformance. $0.08 was due to the net benefit of share repurchase activity, and $0.08 was related to a favorable tax rate versus plan. Now turning to our shareholder returns programs. As previously announced, following determination of the merger agreement with Capri in November, we took swift action to utilize our significant cash flow to execute a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program underscoring our outlook for growth and unwavering commitment to deliver shareholder value. Together with our dividend, which is expected at $1.40 per share for the year, we are positioned to return over $2 billion or more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2025. A testament to our strong organic business and robust cash flow generation. And now before turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, which are unchanged. We have two foundational commitments. First, to continue to invest in our brands and business to support long-term sustainable growth, second, to continue to return capital to shareholders via our dividend. As we've shared, we have a goal over time to increase the dividend at least in line with earnings to achieve our stated targeted payout ratio of 35% to 40%. Beyond these foundational commitments, our robust cash flow generation provides us with balance sheet flexibility for value creation. This includes the opportunity for share repurchase activity, which is on display this year. In addition, we have $800 million remaining on previous share repurchase authorization for future buyback activity. Finally, utilizing our rigorous four-lens framework, we consistently evaluate opportunities for strategic portfolio management. Importantly, and as previously communicated, before moving forward with any acquisitions, we will ensure Coach remains strong and Kate Spade has returned to sustainable top-line growth. These clear capital allocation priorities are underpinned by our firm commitment to a solid investment-grade rating and maintaining our long-term gross leverage target of below 2.5 times. Now turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $1 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $2.7 billion representing net debt of $1.7 billion. This includes $1.5 billion of senior notes raised during the quarter at a blended interest rate of 5.3% to help fund our ASR. At quarter end, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.6 times. Adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter was an inflow of approximately $890 million and CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing were $39 million. And inventory levels at quarter end were 14% above prior year as planned. As we move into the back half of our fiscal year, our inventory is current and well-positioned globally and by brand in support of our growth ambition. To this end, we continue to expect to end Q3 and the full year with inventory above year. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal 2025, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are raising our fiscal year 2025 revenue operating margin, EPS, and cash flow outlook. Importantly, we continue to view our outlook as prudent and achievable as we remain clear-eyed about the realities of the environment balanced with the opportunities we see for our business. For the fiscal year, we now expect revenue of over $6.85 billion representing growth of approximately 3% versus prior year on a reported basis, including an expected currency headwind of over 50 basis points. Touching on sales by region at constant currency, we expect growth in Europe in the area of 30% where we are underpenetrated and have strong traction. In other Asia, we anticipate high single-digit gains while in Japan, we're forecasting a low single-digit decline. In North America, we expect revenue to be up slightly as we continue to support healthy business. And in Greater China, we expect low single-digit growth over the prior year. In addition, our outlook now assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points versus prior year, we anticipate gross margin expansion to drive this increase. Due to improvements in both AUR and AUC, both freight and FX are still expected to have a negligible impact on gross margin changes for the full year. On SG&A, we expect expenses to increase above the pace of revenue growth driven primarily from increased marketing expense including accelerated investments at Kate Spade, while we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control, we're making deliberate growth-focused investments in our strategic priorities. Moving to below the line expectations for the year, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $35 million as compared to prior guidance of $20 million of net interest income. This change reflects the interest on our new bond issuance as well as a lower cash balance due to the execution of the ASR program. This outlook also incorporates the expectation to repay our April 2025 bonds totaling $303 million at maturity. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% to 18% and our weighted average diluted share count for the year is forecasted to be approximately 223 million shares as compared to our prior guidance of approximately 238 million shares reflecting the partial year net benefit of share repurchase activity which includes the initial delivery of approximately 28 million shares received in November. So taken together, we're raising our EPS guidance to $4.85 to $4.90 representing 13% to 14% growth compared to last year, ahead of our prior guidance of $4.50 to $4.55. This increase incorporates our Q2 operational outperformance of $0.17 full year net benefit from share repurchase activities of a dime and a net tailwind of $0.08 from favorable tax rate partially offset by a planned second half currency headwind. To briefly touch on the topic of tariffs, this guidance embeds the expectation for an additional 10% tariff on goods imported from China into the US beginning February 4th which is expected to have an immaterial impact on fiscal 2025 results given our limited manufacturing exposure to China. We continue to monitor the external landscape closely and are developing potential mitigating actions as needed. To note, we do not have production in Canada or Mexico. Moving on, we now anticipate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. Finally, we expect CapEx and cloud computing cost to be in the area of $170 million. We anticipate two-thirds of the spend to be related to store openings, renovation, and relocations, with the balance primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments. Touching on the shaping of the year, we expect revenue to increase the area of 4% in the back half of the year on a constant currency basis. Including an expected FX headwind, we anticipate revenue growth in the area of 3% for the second half with fairly balanced top-line growth between quarters. Turning to operating margin, we expect expansion versus prior year in the second half driven by gross margin improvement, while SG&A is expected to grow modestly above the pace of reported sales gains with a higher level of growth planned in Q3 relative to Q4. And this is based on the phasing of investments. And we expect our tax rate in Q3 to be below the full year average. Taken together, we expect second half EPS growth with Q3 EPS forecasted to approach $0.85. In closing, we delivered a record-breaking quarter highlighted by accelerated top and bottom line growth led by Coach, our largest brand. And from this position of strength, we raised our outlook for the year. Importantly, our commitment to disciplined brand building and our intense focus on fundamentals allows us to invest in our future growth drivers leaning into the biggest opportunities where we'll build strong gains and extend our competitive advantages while returning over $2 billion in capital to shareholders. In this fiscal year alone, we are confident in our brands, our people, our strategy, and our outlook with steadfast focus on delivering accelerated growth and enhanced shareholder value in fiscal 2025 and for years to come. I'd now like to open it up and take your questions.\nOperator: To withdraw yourself from the queue, you may press Star two. Our first question is from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim. Hi. Good morning.\nBob Drbul: Just have two questions really. The first one just on Coach, what really drove the success this quarter? Do you think that it's sustainable? And the second one is just can you expand a bit more just how you're thinking about Kate Spade going forward. Thanks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, and good morning, Bob. The record-breaking quarter we delivered shows the power of our organic growth opportunities and our brand building strategies. As you can see, our teams are confident and focused. Our strategies are working and they're compounding, and there is more growth ahead. I will say Tapestry is committed to continuing to fuel that sustainable growth at Coach, and I'll turn it to Todd to discuss Coach in more detail, and then I'll jump back in to address your question on Kate.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Joanne, and thank you, Bob, for the support. I can say without any reservation, the strong growth in revenue and profitability at Coach is sustainable. And my confidence is based on four key pillars from our brand building playbook that we've honed over the last few years. So let me run you through them. First, culture. Culture, I cannot overemphasize. We've materially changed our culture at Coach and Tapestry, which is truly foundational to our success. We have developed an environment where creativity, innovation, inform risk-taking, with a true test and learn agenda leads. And not just the opinion of the most senior person in the room. Even if that's me sometimes. Second, our deep consumer insights that inform our business strategies, products, and marketing spend. And it's scalable and markets across the brand and Tapestry. You think about it, you see this in play in North America, in China, and Europe. Third, our focus on customer acquisition with our targeted Gen Z cohort. These clients are discovering the brand at record numbers. They're transacting at higher AURs, and with greater frequency. Fourth, our key focus on handbags and leather goods. Providing incredible value, authenticity, and craftsmanship at scale. Demonstrated by the success of our icons. Such as Tabby, Brooklyn, and Terry. So if I had to summarize, something we talk about a lot here. Coach is a storied brand with over eighty years history winning today, we are winning with a modern client. We're doing this because we are understanding the consumer, we're nurturing creativity, we're operating as a high-performing team, and we're managing with financial rigor.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, Todd. Really displaying disciplined brand building, and then I appreciate it. On Kate Spade, we are taking action, and we're bringing focus to our execution, and we're accelerating our investments to drive that long-term growth. We have made changes. We have a new CEO, Eva Erdman, who's partnering with Sandeep, our chief growth officer, and we're leveraging deeper consumer insights and we're building on the learnings from Coach. You just heard Todd talk about the successes we've built at Coach. We're starting at Kate with focus and streamlining. What we've heard from our customers is the need to remove deselection barriers. Reducing our style counts and we're reducing promotional activity. At the same time, we're leaning into marketing investments to fuel brand interest and ultimately drive new customer acquisition that we know will power our growth in the future. We have work to do. This is a multi-quarter journey, but our strategies are clear and the path to long-term growth is in our control. At Tapestry, we're being disciplined about how we allocate resources and capital. So come back to where we started, we're both fueling Coach and investing across our portfolio for the future. We delivered a strong quarter and raised our outlook, and we're doing that while accelerating investments to reset Kate Spade.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question is from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Hey.\nIke Boruchow: Congrats. Great results. Glad to see it. Two from me, maybe first for Joanne, maybe second for Scott. Just kind of digging a little bit more into Coach, specifically in terms of the robust numbers you guys are putting up. Maybe can you talk about, Joanne, maybe how much did the New York family and Tabby contribute to Coach's growth? What percent of sales do these two families represent? Any more detail there might be helpful. And then follow-up for Scott. Just core drivers of potential margin expansion ahead. How are you thinking about the pace of future gross margin expansion at Coach just following all the recent strength would be helpful.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Sure. I can pick it up. And just let you know that Coach's business is based on really strong foundational principles, and the growth is broad-based. And I think I'll talk it to Todd to cover the details on the business at Coach.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks. I appreciate that. We're so pleased with our platforms. And what's so different about Coach today is we don't have a single platform. We have multiple platforms but they're still very focused. So first, no single platform counts for more than 10% of our sales. Whether that's the Tabby family, whether that's the New York family. So I see a lot of runway with those families as well as Terry in outlet. So we have foundational families that we can drive real business with. Amazing is all of them Terry, Tabby, Brooklyn, are attracting this younger consumer. And so we're attracting this younger consumer across the price spectrum. Which is phenomenal for us. You're gonna Scott's gonna talk about gross margin. I will give a plug. If you think about gross margin, the way we're thinking about it, we just came off of what typically is the highest promotional quarter in our industry. Delivered over 77% gross margin. And, again, that was the highest gross margin in the second quarter in Coach's history. I see incredible sustainable growth in gross margin over the long term. And as we continue to create desirable product, have to use price points. With the scale and the opportunities that the Tapestry supply chain provides. So both on raising price and on reducing our cost, we have a lot of runway left. Scott, hopefully, I left you something on the on the on the boat.\nScott Roe: You know, here's the great news, Todd, is we're in full alignment. Right? This management team prioritizes both gross margin and operating margin. And you know, AUR gross, AUC, which I always say is that most underappreciated part of the story. As our teams look at what consumers really value, we've got using AI for price elasticity. I mean, we're getting a lot more sophisticated as we look at these trade-offs and decisions and that plus the investment in brands brand love. And Todd always says emotion trumps price, and you see that on display, right, with the strong operational beat that we had in gross margin and how that's consolidating into near market-leading operating margins and Coach more than 33%. So what's ahead? You can expect that same basic flywheel. We're gonna grow our gross margins gonna continue to invest in engagement with consumers, which is through increasing marketing and more importantly, more effective marketing and storytelling. And we're balancing the long-term investments with short-term commitments to our shareholders. And I hope you see that's on display with record earnings in the second quarter and a strong beat and raise for the full year. What that means is 200 basis points of gross margin expansion and about 100 basis points in terms of op margin expansion. As we deliver for the short term, but also invest for the long term.\nIke Boruchow: Congrats, guys.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Ike.\nOperator: And our next question is from Adrienne Yih of Barclays.\nAdrienne Yih: Good morning. And let me add my congratulations. Really well done. Joanne, I'm gonna go back to Kate Spade. You know, often when we kind of change the strategy, just wondering who do you envision in Ava envision today is the target market target consumer, kind of how you define her specifically. And then Scott and or Todd, this is kind of a both of you question. So, within Coach, Scott, can you give us can you talk about the AUR lift? Like, how much higher on a five-year basis is AUR? But more specifically, how much of that is actually from lower markdowns how much are your initial retail prices higher versus five years ago then segues to Todd Isn't this the largest spread to pinnacle luxury mean, that we've seen ever covering the space? It just seems like that Europe is testament to the fact you have a whole new market that's sort of been abdicated by Pinnacle Luxury. If you can speak to that, that'd be great. Thanks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah. Thanks, Adrienne, and I'll jump in on Kate Spade. And I would say that it's not so much of a strategy change. The principles of brand building at Tapestry across our portfolio remain intact, and our focus is on sharpening our execution. And as we think about improving that execution, it is in through building more relevance for a target younger consumer. One of the learnings that we've had and our approach is to make sure that we're attracting new customers to the brand, but also new and younger consumers to our brands. Because we know that by 2030, 70% of the consumption in our category will be with new and younger consumers. So we see that as the lifeblood. And as we do deeper consumer research, we're listening and responding and improving our execution behind what we hear to bring more relevance to the brand both in product and in the experiences and storytelling that we develop. And some of the actions we've taken already are showing some traction. We know we need to streamline and focus. What we're hearing from the customer is removing those deselection barriers. Reducing the style counts, that allows us to take big ideas and have them cut through for the consumer and also reducing promotional activity. As we mentioned and as you know and what we see in the market, innovation is winning with the consumer. Continuously hitting the consumer over the head with price is not winning. And so we will sharpen our execution around that as we build the brand and reset the brand. We're also making investments. We're gonna reach our target consumer on the right platform with relevant messaging. And we're leaning into investments there. We see how effective that has been in building brand heat and desire and we're beginning that. We know that's not an overnight change, but we're beginning those investments. And the beauty of it is that we have a strong portfolio. We are beating our estimates. We're raising our outlook, and we're making these changes and investments. And I will end by saying that I'm really excited to partner with Ava. We've brought in a really strong brand builder and the team is very focused on moving quickly behind these actions.\nScott Roe: Yeah. Let me build on that real quick. Yeah. Just put some numbers Adrienne, on the CAE guide. So in the in the quarter, we're down about 10%. We expect the top line trend to be more or less the same. Through the second half of this year. With gross margins continuing to build, moderating a little bit from what we saw in the first. We lapped some of the cost initiatives from a year ago, but still positive in gross margin. And as Joanne just said and we indicated in prepared remarks, significant investment brand building. It'll be the highest percentage brand building as a percentage. Obviously, Coach had absolutely turned as much larger, but the largest percentage increase in what gives us conviction around making that? It's what we've seen on display in Coach. And remember, the phases of this were we're focusing on brand awareness, then we're gonna go followed by customer acquisition and finally growth. Had a beat raise for the full year. Even more importantly, don't lose the thread because we and we're able to not only make these investments in Kate Spade for the long term, but deliver in the short term. To shareholders based on the results that we just printed. I'll throw it to Todd on the AUR question. I think better served by him.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Scott. I chuckle a little bit because in the since FY19, in about the 20 quarters, we've been doing this together, I think 19 of them. We've had an AUR question. I think nine of them we've gone to AUR. So indeed. What's exciting is you and every quarter, like, I did it. Is this it? Is this it? And, you know, we keep hopefully surprising you on the upside. So first, I'm AUR this last do we do? Deliver double-digit handbag growth on AUR and even in North America. So your question is insightful. There's a couple things at play here. Obviously, value matters. And we offer incredible value against maybe traditional European luxury and people are seeing that. And you're seeing it in markets like Europe, where we're seeing double-digit growth because there's value. But I will also say, the value equation is only part of it. You have to have compelling product. You have to say your product has to stand for something. I talk a lot about value and values. Our focus, this timeless Gen Z customer. And we're our insight that we keep developing and how we continue to build on that insight. It is the cornerstone for everything we do. It's the cornerstone that informs Stuart and our design team. It's the cornerstone of our operations, and it's the cornerstone of our storytelling. So excuse me. The value in value is just clear. I see a lot of AUR growth. We obviously don't have to discount product. But also what we've done over these last couple of years is we focus on fewer stories, deeper icons. We don't have to we don't have that vicious cycle of markdowns that historically you have in our space. Because we're reinforcing fewer deeper ideas.\nAdrienne Yih: Fantastic. Well done.\nScott Roe: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.\nMatthew Boss: Thanks, and congrats on a great quarter. So Joanne, with Coach now at a position of strength, as you cited, could you speak to new customer acquisition trends in North America and Greater China and specifically elaborate on opportunities you see to further accelerate growth just given the momentum and clear move to offense. And then, Scott, on the bottom line, earnings this year raised to low to mid-teens. That's your former growth algorithm. Is there any reason that this pace is not sustainable multiyear.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: You know, we are I think that second quarter demonstrates the power of our brand building capabilities. It is the disciplines that we have on display. Coach is leading, Coach is taking share, and it does start with really leaning in to the true essence of the brand understanding our target consumer, and delivering relevant product, emotional product experiences, and storytelling to deepen the engagement with the consumer. And this is a journey that we've been on for years, and we continue to build and hone our capabilities here, and we're driving success. It's not just a customer acquisition that we're after. We're after customer acquisition with a younger consumer. And in the Coach case, with the young timeless, Gen Z consumer. And that's where you see as we get more focused on exactly who our target customer is and bring all of the capabilities of our company, including the incredible innovation and creativity that the teams are delivering. With our commercial capabilities around the world. That is cutting through with our target consumer. We're acquiring more consumers. That accelerated in the quarter. More than half, 60% at Coach for Gen Z, and millennial consumers, and what's interesting about customer acquisition, as you asked, it's these customers are coming into the brand in a healthy way. They're transacting at higher AUR than the average and they're now coming back with more frequency. So building that lifetime value that we value with the young consumer. So that is the focus. It's the focus of our brand building capabilities. And it really starts with having a systemic understanding of the consumer and a continuous learning agenda. And I would say that the teams, while they have success, they continue to stay humble and curious, and we see a second quarter demonstrates, this will drive growth. And we're just getting started. We see more growth ahead. And a lot of opportunity across our portfolio and with Coach.\nScott Roe: And I guess on the second part of the question, Matt, is it sustainable? Short answer, yes. In my opinion. And why do I have conviction? Around that? Well, Todd gave a lot of it, right, which is our continued strength in AUR, our AUC initiatives, and one of the with the best supply chain in the business, gross margin growth. We'll continue to invest, but we also read and react. I think this is an important part. We don't just invest to invest. We invest where we see those indications and that's in our control and we're balancing short term and long term as we think about those investments. And then, obviously, our commitment is to continue to grow earnings. Other thing I'd point out is the strong cash flow yield. You know, we just raised our free cash flow to $1.2 billion. We've got a very strong balance sheet and a lot of options delivering even more shareholder value in the future. Whether it be through buybacks or other actions.\nMatthew Boss: Congrats again.\nScott Roe: Yeah. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to build on the discussion around these powerful new handbag franchises. How do you balance their near-term success with also ensuring that the pipeline is full of new products to take over when those products pass peak?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Go ahead, Todd. I'll let you jump in. Yeah. I'm confident in our innovation pipeline. But, Todd, I'll let you jump in.\nTodd Kahn: You know, it's an interesting phenomenon. We and we recognize this with Tabby, and I think I might have said in prior investor calls. But from 2019, what we started to see Tabby slowdown. And, typically, what would have happened is we would have exited it, it would have gone into outlet. But we would have had the markdown liability a year later, we come out with a new bag called Gabby with the similar attribute. And we'd start the cycle all over again. We stop that cycle. What we did is we took the platform and we innovated in the platform. It was in Tabby's case. We launched Pillow Tabby. Not only did it create an entire new opportunity, it enhanced the original Tabby. We keep doing that more and more. And one of the things I looked at, it was I had a walk through yesterday for fall. The New York family, the Empire, the Brooklyn, we're seeing so much innovation under the platform. That's powerful. And it's cohesive. So when a customer comes in, their choices it tells a compelling story, and you see that with our New York family, which really we're just getting started. New York family is less than a year old. It became the number one bag in the list the first time in our history Coach had two products in the top ten in the list. Conversely, Tabby, we have so much runway. For Tabby. And what I love about Tabby is it has such a distinct hardware in the sculpted C that is ownable and desirable by our clients.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning, and thank you for taking our question. Joanne, Scott, Todd, I was hoping we could dive a little bit deeper in the momentum that you're seeing in China in particular. It sounds like you have a little bit more optimism there than last quarter on an x FX basis. What's working specifically there? What's changing in the execution of your and mortar strategy for Coach, and how should we be thinking about the opportunity to accelerate Coach as well as your other brands in that region going forward. Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Sure. Why don't I kick it off, Brooke? We were pleased to see Greater China return to growth in the second quarter. We delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter significantly outpacing the industry and I think that speaks to the success of our strategies. The brand building capabilities that are working are working globally. And it does underscore the opportunity ahead. We have strong broad-based performance across channels and city tiers in China, the team is importantly bringing the innovation and the value to consumers in that market. Our brand is positioned quite well in the market, and we're investing, including in higher levels of marketing in the region. And we're seeing consumers respond, including younger consumers. So we are driving Gen Z acquisition. So the principles of brand building that are working at Coach are working across the globe. Maybe I'll talk it to Todd if I left you any material to cover how you're thinking about China, but we remain confident in the long-term opportunity overall in China. But, Todd, any color on Coach specifically?\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Joanne. You know, again, we've been in China for over 25 years. We have a depth and a richness to China and understanding in China. We spend a lot of time there. We have amazing people and stores on the ground which really drive everything. And some of the things I've talked about, I think, last call, I mentioned the visit to Wuxi. I know many of you had a better look up where Wuxi was. Small city of nine million people with, you know, three current Coach stores, which opportunity to triple that. That story replicates itself often. This growth of the middle class is so powerful for our brand. Again, going back to value and values, both resonate with this Chinese consumer. So I was so pleased to see a return to growth in China. You're gonna see more growth coming out of China. And in addition to productivity growth as we see increases in traffic. Gonna see distribution growth. We really believe in China. We believe that the Coach brand represents something very special in China. For a number millions and millions of clients. And, again, when you think about people coming of age, eighteen, nineteen, twenty-year-olds, who wanna buy their first bag. We want more than our fair share of that client coming to Coach. We have the right to get them.\nBrooke Roach: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Binetti of Evercore.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys. Let me just add my congrats on a great holiday there, especially Coach North America. Incredible work. I'm sure you guys are proud of it. I just ask you on the path forward on AUR. Is there a point where Brooklyn and Tabby and the franchises that you've spoken about today, all the new consumers you've brought in, the good retention rates, that Joanne talked about start to translate to unit growth. I think if we, you know, back out the AURs you talked about, units are probably still so negatives. Or do you see do you still see the growth coming largely from AUR in the near that's where the momentum is and unit growth would be upside. And then, Scott, just a quick follow-up to you just to help us think about your near-term priorities for high how to think about flow through if the revenue upside does continue. I know you held the SG&A rate to what we were expecting in the quarter, but you were still you still grew the dollars when the revenue came in. It sounded like went to the top of funnel things that can drive the brand going forward. So just how to think about, you know, your priorities for SG&A if you do see upside revenues in the back half. Thanks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah. On AUR and units, your question I think Todd covered the AUR. His confidence in the AUR earlier on the call. Our innovation pipeline is strong. AUR is driving our growth, but we see the opportunity for us. It's an and, not an or. We see the opportunity to drive units going forward both with the expansion of the market and new customer acquisition as well as with, you know, category expansion as these brands continue to drive heat. And maybe toss it to Scott for the flow through.\nScott Roe: Yeah. So I, you know, I can't really give you a definitive answer other than that we will continue to see flow through my we're leaning in where we see real opportunities and for example, we mentioned the Cape where we saw some traction in the campaign with Madison Beer and some of the opportunities leaning in and certainly, we could have made more money. We expect the profit in Kate to be in the 7% range or $85 to $90 million. We could've made that a lot higher but we see the opportunity long term to make that investment. And we can do that while we're still at the Tapestry level delivering significant beats. So we're gonna look at all these investments. You will see flow through. I wouldn't expect a radical change. We've invested where we see that it's prudent, but if other things come up, we'll certainly take those.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question and answer. I will now turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat for some concluding remarks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thank you. Today, we had the opportunity to share our standout holiday results and stronger fiscal 2025 outlook. And what I want to leave you with is a reiteration of our focus and confidence. Coach is an iconic brand, and we're winning with a new generation of consumers around the world. I've never been more confident in the brand and its innovation pipeline. Our success shows that our strategies are working and that a commitment to disciplined brand building drives results. And with this momentum, we're extending our competitive advantages and bringing more focus and investment to Kate Spade. Kate Spade is a unique and beloved brand. We have new leadership, a clear roadmap for long-term growth, and the learnings from Coach to pave our way forward. There is work to do, but we're moving decisively, and we're confident that the path to growth is within our control. Overall, we have a bold ambition to drive accelerated, durable organic growth. And we're focused and confident that the value creation opportunity in front of us is compelling. For our brands, consumers, talented teams, and shareholders. Thank you again to our exceptional global teams for fueling our growth and thank you to everyone who joined us today for your interest in our story. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes Tapestry's earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

I'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry CEO. Good morning.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome everyone. As noted in our press release, our strong second quarter results outperformed expectations showcasing our commitment to disciplined brand building. Our exceptional teams brought innovation and craftsmanship to consumers around the world this holiday season, driving accelerated top and bottom line growth to achieve record quarterly revenue and earnings per share. From this position of strength, we increased our outlook for fiscal year 2025 while making strategic investments to extend our competitive advantages and fuel strong, durable growth and value creation into the future. Touching on the highlights of the quarter. First, we powered global growth with total revenue gains of 5% outpacing guidance. Fueled by 10% growth at Coach, by geography, all regions exceeded expectations. International revenue rose 7% at constant currency, led by an increase of 42% in Europe, where our business is strong and our runway for growth is significant. In addition, we delivered a sales increase of 1% in the total APAC region. In Greater China specifically, we returned to growth with revenue rising 2%. Importantly, we continue to bring compelling innovation, relevance, and value to consumers with a sharp focus driving long-term growth in the region and with this important consumer cohort. And in North America, revenue increased 4% compared to last year, while gross and operating margin expanded as we continue to drive a healthy business. Second, we remained focused on building new and lasting relationships with consumers. During the quarter, we drove new customer acquisition growth, welcoming approximately 2.7 million new customers in North America alone. Over half of these customers were Gen Z and millennials. And they continue to transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. Importantly, Gen Z consumers at Coach have the highest retention rate of all cohorts, reinforcing the opportunity to build lifetime value with our target consumer base. At the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America, highlighting our ability to successfully engage our existing customer base as we recruit new consumers to our brands. Third, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences underpinned by Tapestry's leading capabilities which enable us to enhance the customer experience across all touchpoints with our brands. To this end, we maintained strength in digital, which grew high single digits versus prior year and represented approximately one-third of revenue at accretive margins. Our global brick and mortar sales rose at a low single-digit rate in the quarter at strong and increasing profitability. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence. As we remain focused on bringing creativity, quality, and compelling value to consumers around the world, this is clearly on display at Coach where we delivered strong and broad-based growth in handbags with AUR gains. Underscoring the vibrancy of the brand and product offering. Our success is also reflected in our strong gross margin, as we achieved a record second quarter gross margin with further opportunity for expansion long term. Importantly, underpinning our innovation pipeline and margin gains is our agile supply chain. A key competitive advantage which enables us to deliver craftsmanship globally and powers our growth. Overall, we generated record earnings per share which exceeded our expectations and increased over 20% compared to the prior year. Importantly, our business is strong today and well-positioned for the future as we remain committed to delivering consistent long-term growth and shareholder value. Now moving to our results and strategies by brand. Coach had a breakout quarter as we continue to drive brand heat, and bring this storied brand to a new generation of consumers. Coach's success is compounding. And it demonstrates the enduring power of its expressive luxury positioning. Our growth is credit to our talented global teams who are operating with excellence and intention to deliver innovation across products, marketing, and experiences to cultivate emotional and lasting connections with consumers. To this end, during the quarter, we achieved 10% constant currency revenue gains at exceptional margins highlighted by 270 basis points of gross margin expansion and a 210 basis point lift in operating margin. Importantly, our strategies are working with three key areas underpinning our accelerated growth. First, new Gen Z customer acquisition resulting from our systematic understanding and engagement with our target consumer. Second, strength in our core leather goods category where we have authenticity and scale and our innovation is winning. Third, global outperformance led by North America and Europe and a return to growth in Greater China. These growth pillars will continue to drive our success in the future. Now touching on the strategic highlights of the second quarter in more detail. First, our results were driven by strong gains in leather goods, where we have multiple platforms for growth, given the power of our iconic handbag families and the success of new product introductions. The Tabby family once again outperformed over indexing with new and younger consumers and doubling versus last year. Building strength on strength the Tabby shoulder bag 26 continued to anchor the offering, with momentum in core Tabby, as well as new introductions, including the Times Square and Quilted Tabby. In addition, the recently launched New York family significantly outpaced expectations featuring the Brooklyn and Empire bags. During the quarter, the Brooklyn shoulder bag 28 at $295 was a top recruitment driver. While the soft Empire Carryall 40 at $695 outperformed. The New York family, a new foundation for the brand, continue to prove incremental and compelling. Providing innovation that's clearly resonating with consumers globally. Further, our Coach Originals collection featuring archival bags that celebrate the brand's legacy with a modern sensibility drove growth, notably with Gen Z consumers. And finally, bag charms and straps amplified our offerings, particularly the viral cherry charm cutting through for being emotional, highly giftable, and trend-right. Importantly, our strategies are driving strong brand heat and desire among Gen Z consumers. In fact, Coach was again recognized by The List climbing ten places to become the world's fifth hottest brand with the Brooklyn bag leading as this quarter's hottest product. Additionally, the Coach cherry bag charm entered the list as the number four hottest product. Overall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories continued to outpace the industry. Which included mid-teens AUR gains globally, led by North America. And looking forward, we remain confident in the opportunity for further sustainable growth given our brand strength and innovation pipeline as well as the compelling value and craftsmanship we offer in the luxury market. Next, we remain focused on fueling life with an emphasis on footwear. Where we are underpenetrated and have a right to win by leveraging our brand strength to drive customer recruitment, frequency, and lifetime value with our target, timeless, Gen Z consumer. During the quarter, we successfully launched the new Highline sneaker, which sold at $125 in both retail and outlet. Attracted new customers to the brand. This introduction in both retail and outlet channels builds on our one Coach learning agenda, which we successfully piloted with Tabby. Turning to marketing. We continue to drive cultural relevance through emotional storytelling that amplifies our brand and product offering. This holiday, we rolled out the next chapter of our Unlock Your Courage Campaign. And with each campaign, we're learning. Gaining deeper consumer insights that enhance our storytelling and media. This capability enables us to deliver the right content at the right time on the right platform ensuring that our messages are cutting through. This is key to driving sustainable customer acquisition and it's working globally at scale. To this end, during the quarter, we continued to increase our top of funnel marketing investments. Demonstrating the confidence we have in our brand and product offering. As a result, this helped drive greater consumer engagement and outperformance versus the industry. Particularly in our key markets of North America and China. In addition, we also cultivated enthusiasm for the brand, through unique and immersive retail experiences. Our Coach Play concept stores, which engage consumers across their five senses, continue to outperform with higher Gen Z traffic, longer dwell times, and higher return frequency. We are taking these learnings and evaluating opportunities to bring the highest impact elements of these locations to our store fleet more broadly. Overall, our holistic brand building activities helped to drive increases in new customer acquisition as we welcomed over 1.7 million new customers to Coach in North America, a strong increase versus prior year and a significant acceleration in trend. Of these new customers, nearly 60% were Gen Z and millennials. Consistent with our strategy to recruit younger customers. At the same time, our retention rate with the Gen Z cohort also increased reinforcing that we're building lasting relationships with our consumers in support of durable growth. In closing, Coach, our largest brand, is strong and differentiated. And it continues to deliver outstanding results highlighting the capabilities of Tapestry's growth engine. With consumer understanding at the center of all we do, our talented teams are delivering the blend of magic and logic that is the hallmark of the brand and the foundation of our future. From this position of strength, I'm confident our best days are still to come with significant opportunity to drive continued consistent long-term growth. Now moving to Kate Spade. While profit results met our expectations for the quarter, driven by gross margin expansion. Revenue trends declined 10%. Most importantly, together with Eva Erdman, Kate Spade's new CEO, we are moving quickly and decisively, addressing what we know is not working and laying the groundwork for a return to sustainable profitable growth. Since Eva's arrival in October, we've assessed the current state of the business and made progress in building our roadmap for the future. Informed by deeper consumer insights. The takeaway of this work is clear. We need to rebuild the brand with consumers to reignite growth. To do this, we must focus our execution and accelerate our investments. With clear priorities distorted to our largest opportunities developing emotional storytelling to fuel customer acquisition, building handbag icons and driving growth in North America, our home market. And we see the path forward as having two important stages, first, we will streamline and solidify our foundation. By editing for focus, and investing to build brand heat. This will ultimately drive customer acquisition, which will allow us to scale from a healthy foundation, which is the prerequisite for sustainable top line growth. While we are acting with urgency, we acknowledge the work to reset the brand is a multi-quarter journey. Having said that, we know the path to growth is within our control and I am confident in the plan we've developed and the significant opportunity ahead for the brand. Now let me take you through our growth strategies and learnings in more detail, which includes results from the quarter. First, we're committed to fueling brand heat. Through relevant marketing to drive consideration and accelerate customer acquisition. During the quarter, we took a step forward in our brand building efforts. And this began with streamlining. In the fall, we made the decision to reduce spending on our fall campaign based on consumer feedback during testing. Instead, we pivoted, working with speed and agility to create new, more compelling content. And in December, we launched our holiday campaign. This was a social-first campaign featuring Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Madison Beer. Consistent with our strategy to distort our marketing investments, into upper funnel campaigns with more relevant messages for our target consumer. Importantly, the tagline to the one who was pulled through creative activations on social media and in our stores. Following the campaign, we saw a significant increase in purchase intent among Gen Z consumers who engaged with the content. Reinforcing the opportunity to make incremental marketing investments to drive consideration and ultimately new customer acquisition. As a result, we are extending our brand campaign in the third quarter to sustain and amplify engagement with consumers. Importantly, our learnings will be used to inform our bigger picture efforts as we build towards a larger purpose-driven 360-degree campaign launch in the fall of 2025. Next, we are focused on sharpening and elevating our handbag offering, improving our to drive more relevancy in our assortment. In support of this ambition, we leveraged our consumer survey work which illuminated the need to streamline our offering. Clearing deselection barriers through a tighter assortment and improved styling. By simplifying our product stories and focusing our merchandising efforts, we will ensure that the big ideas in leather goods cut through with more cohesion and relevancy. With this effort, we expect to reduce the number of handbag styles by over 15% by fall. At the same time, we will work to build blockbuster handbag families informed by consumer understanding. And we have learnings from holiday. We stood firmly behind the recently launched Deco Collection and our stores and in our marketing. The Deco collection continues to over-index with new younger consumers at strong AUR and margins. We see further opportunity for this family going forward. Importantly, we know when it's rise thirty years ago, Kate Spade offered a pioneering proposition in the market along with distinctive iconic. And this is our aim today. To build on what made us unique and successful historically in a way that is modern and relevant to our consumers today. Next, are focused on maximizing omnichannel cohesiveness with one brand message across all consumer touchpoints. Importantly, we are taking steps to reduce our promotional messaging across channels. The results of the last quarter reinforce that emotion and newness are what's winning with consumers. While promotional activity is not. Therefore, decreasing our level of promotional activity will be a key building block of solidifying our brand and positioning it to scale in a healthy way. Globally over the long term. To this end, we expect our gross margin to continue to expand moving forward as we build for the future and connect consumers on our brand values, beyond simply price. In closing, we are focused on executing our strategic roadmap for durable growth, and we are accelerating our investments to do this. We acknowledge that our strategic actions will pressure the brand's near-term financial results. However, the strength of our portfolio allows us to do this while delivering enhanced growth overall. Importantly, we have conviction that we are taking the right steps to reset the brand and unlock its full potential. Kate Spade is a beloved, unique, and purpose-driven brand. And though there is significant work to do to enhance its relevancy and reconnect with consumers, the strategy to deliver this outcome is well understood and in our control. We are confident in the meaningful long-term runway for the brand the value creation opportunity it represents for Tapestry. Now turning to Stuart Weitzman. Financial results remain challenged in the quarter with net sales decreasing 16% versus prior year at constant currency. Primarily reflecting softness in Greater China and in North America direct channels. In addition, global wholesale net sales declined impacted by shipment timing, while trends at POS remained strong growing at over 20% a key indicator of strategic progress. Overall, the Stuart Weitzman team remains focused on fueling brand relevancy, driving customer engagement, and delivering improved financial results long term. In closing, Tapestry delivered a standout holiday quarter. I want to thank our teams once again for their passion, creativity, and commitment to brand building and for driving our strong results. From this position of strength, we raised our outlook for the year with a sharp focus on the path forward. We will continue to fuel momentum at Coach. While taking action to reset the Kate Spade brand for long-term growth. We are confident that our bold growth agenda will support meaningful value creation, and we look forward to sharing the details of our long-term roadmap at an investor day this fall. Our future is bright. And we have the ambition, discipline, and strategies to generate strong and durable growth and shareholder returns for years to come. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Roe: Thanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results exceeded expectations. Building on our track record of consistent execution as we unlocked accelerated growth, in the quarter, we delivered record quarterly revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share, while generating significant free cash flow. Now moving to the details of the quarter beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales increased 5% compared to the prior year and outperformed our guidance across all regions. These results reflect gains in Europe, North America, and total APAC with international revenue growing 7%. By region, Europe revenue grew 42% above last year with growth across all brands and channels driven by increased local consumer spend, and strong new customer acquisition, notably with Gen Z. In Greater China, revenue inflected to growth of 2%. Our sequential acceleration was driven by a return to growth in our brick and mortar channel, led by an improvement in traffic, while trends in digital remained positive. Our differentiated results in China clearly demonstrate that our strategic initiatives and investments in the region are yielding returns. Positioning our brands and business for long-term sustainable growth. And in other Asia, revenue rose 11% led by growth in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and Malaysia, while Japan sales declined 5%. In North America, sales increased 4% compared to the prior year, led by double-digit growth at Coach. Importantly, total gross and operating margin rose versus last year. Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 4% compared to the prior year, which included a high single-digit increase in digital revenue, and a low single-digit increase in global brick and mortar sales. And wholesale revenue grew in the quarter, in keeping with our expectations and strategy to find targeted opportunities to expand our brand's reach with consumers. Moving down the P&L, we delivered a record second quarter gross margin which was well ahead of plan and 280 basis points above prior year. This year-over-year expansion was driven by 260 basis points of operational outperformance as well as a benefit of approximately 20 basis points from lower freight expense. Our strong gross margin performance remains a core element of our value creation model providing us with flexibility and fuel to accelerate investments and drive long-term growth. Turning to SG&A, which rose 7% led by higher marketing spend versus prior year and forecast as we reinvested a portion of our profit outperformance into incremental brand building activities via top of funnel activations. Taken together, operating margin increased approximately 210 basis points in the quarter driving profit growth ahead of expectations and 15% over the prior year. At our record second quarter EPS of $2 grew 23% over prior year and exceeded our guidance by more than $0.30. To provide context on this beat, approximately $0.17 of the upside was due to operational outperformance. $0.08 was due to the net benefit of share repurchase activity, and $0.08 was related to a favorable tax rate versus plan. Now turning to our shareholder returns programs. As previously announced, following determination of the merger agreement with Capri in November, we took swift action to utilize our significant cash flow to execute a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program underscoring our outlook for growth and unwavering commitment to deliver shareholder value. Together with our dividend, which is expected at $1.40 per share for the year, we are positioned to return over $2 billion or more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2025. A testament to our strong organic business and robust cash flow generation. And now before turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows, I'd like to reiterate our capital allocation priorities, which are unchanged. We have two foundational commitments. First, to continue to invest in our brands and business to support long-term sustainable growth, second, to continue to return capital to shareholders via our dividend. As we've shared, we have a goal over time to increase the dividend at least in line with earnings to achieve our stated targeted payout ratio of 35% to 40%. Beyond these foundational commitments, our robust cash flow generation provides us with balance sheet flexibility for value creation. This includes the opportunity for share repurchase activity, which is on display this year. In addition, we have $800 million remaining on previous share repurchase authorization for future buyback activity. Finally, utilizing our rigorous four-lens framework, we consistently evaluate opportunities for strategic portfolio management. Importantly, and as previously communicated, before moving forward with any acquisitions, we will ensure Coach remains strong and Kate Spade has returned to sustainable top-line growth. These clear capital allocation priorities are underpinned by our firm commitment to a solid investment-grade rating and maintaining our long-term gross leverage target of below 2.5 times. Now turning to the details of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $1 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $2.7 billion representing net debt of $1.7 billion. This includes $1.5 billion of senior notes raised during the quarter at a blended interest rate of 5.3% to help fund our ASR. At quarter end, our gross debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.6 times. Adjusted free cash flow for the second quarter was an inflow of approximately $890 million and CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing were $39 million. And inventory levels at quarter end were 14% above prior year as planned. As we move into the back half of our fiscal year, our inventory is current and well-positioned globally and by brand in support of our growth ambition. To this end, we continue to expect to end Q3 and the full year with inventory above year. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal 2025, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are raising our fiscal year 2025 revenue operating margin, EPS, and cash flow outlook. Importantly, we continue to view our outlook as prudent and achievable as we remain clear-eyed about the realities of the environment balanced with the opportunities we see for our business. For the fiscal year, we now expect revenue of over $6.85 billion representing growth of approximately 3% versus prior year on a reported basis, including an expected currency headwind of over 50 basis points. Touching on sales by region at constant currency, we expect growth in Europe in the area of 30% where we are underpenetrated and have strong traction. In other Asia, we anticipate high single-digit gains while in Japan, we're forecasting a low single-digit decline. In North America, we expect revenue to be up slightly as we continue to support healthy business. And in Greater China, we expect low single-digit growth over the prior year. In addition, our outlook now assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points versus prior year, we anticipate gross margin expansion to drive this increase. Due to improvements in both AUR and AUC, both freight and FX are still expected to have a negligible impact on gross margin changes for the full year. On SG&A, we expect expenses to increase above the pace of revenue growth driven primarily from increased marketing expense including accelerated investments at Kate Spade, while we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control, we're making deliberate growth-focused investments in our strategic priorities. Moving to below the line expectations for the year, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $35 million as compared to prior guidance of $20 million of net interest income. This change reflects the interest on our new bond issuance as well as a lower cash balance due to the execution of the ASR program. This outlook also incorporates the expectation to repay our April 2025 bonds totaling $303 million at maturity. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% to 18% and our weighted average diluted share count for the year is forecasted to be approximately 223 million shares as compared to our prior guidance of approximately 238 million shares reflecting the partial year net benefit of share repurchase activity which includes the initial delivery of approximately 28 million shares received in November. So taken together, we're raising our EPS guidance to $4.85 to $4.90 representing 13% to 14% growth compared to last year, ahead of our prior guidance of $4.50 to $4.55. This increase incorporates our Q2 operational outperformance of $0.17 full year net benefit from share repurchase activities of a dime and a net tailwind of $0.08 from favorable tax rate partially offset by a planned second half currency headwind. To briefly touch on the topic of tariffs, this guidance embeds the expectation for an additional 10% tariff on goods imported from China into the US beginning February 4th which is expected to have an immaterial impact on fiscal 2025 results given our limited manufacturing exposure to China. We continue to monitor the external landscape closely and are developing potential mitigating actions as needed. To note, we do not have production in Canada or Mexico. Moving on, we now anticipate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. Finally, we expect CapEx and cloud computing cost to be in the area of $170 million. We anticipate two-thirds of the spend to be related to store openings, renovation, and relocations, with the balance primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments. Touching on the shaping of the year, we expect revenue to increase the area of 4% in the back half of the year on a constant currency basis. Including an expected FX headwind, we anticipate revenue growth in the area of 3% for the second half with fairly balanced top-line growth between quarters. Turning to operating margin, we expect expansion versus prior year in the second half driven by gross margin improvement, while SG&A is expected to grow modestly above the pace of reported sales gains with a higher level of growth planned in Q3 relative to Q4. And this is based on the phasing of investments. And we expect our tax rate in Q3 to be below the full year average. Taken together, we expect second half EPS growth with Q3 EPS forecasted to approach $0.85. In closing, we delivered a record-breaking quarter highlighted by accelerated top and bottom line growth led by Coach, our largest brand. And from this position of strength, we raised our outlook for the year. Importantly, our commitment to disciplined brand building and our intense focus on fundamentals allows us to invest in our future growth drivers leaning into the biggest opportunities where we'll build strong gains and extend our competitive advantages while returning over $2 billion in capital to shareholders. In this fiscal year alone, we are confident in our brands, our people, our strategy, and our outlook with steadfast focus on delivering accelerated growth and enhanced shareholder value in fiscal 2025 and for years to come. I'd now like to open it up and take your questions.\nOperator: To withdraw yourself from the queue, you may press Star two. Our first question is from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim. Hi. Good morning.\nBob Drbul: Just have two questions really. The first one just on Coach, what really drove the success this quarter? Do you think that it's sustainable? And the second one is just can you expand a bit more just how you're thinking about Kate Spade going forward. Thanks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, and good morning, Bob. The record-breaking quarter we delivered shows the power of our organic growth opportunities and our brand building strategies. As you can see, our teams are confident and focused. Our strategies are working and they're compounding, and there is more growth ahead. I will say Tapestry is committed to continuing to fuel that sustainable growth at Coach, and I'll turn it to Todd to discuss Coach in more detail, and then I'll jump back in to address your question on Kate.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Joanne, and thank you, Bob, for the support. I can say without any reservation, the strong growth in revenue and profitability at Coach is sustainable. And my confidence is based on four key pillars from our brand building playbook that we've honed over the last few years. So let me run you through them. First, culture. Culture, I cannot overemphasize. We've materially changed our culture at Coach and Tapestry, which is truly foundational to our success. We have developed an environment where creativity, innovation, inform risk-taking, with a true test and learn agenda leads. And not just the opinion of the most senior person in the room. Even if that's me sometimes. Second, our deep consumer insights that inform our business strategies, products, and marketing spend. And it's scalable and markets across the brand and Tapestry. You think about it, you see this in play in North America, in China, and Europe. Third, our focus on customer acquisition with our targeted Gen Z cohort. These clients are discovering the brand at record numbers. They're transacting at higher AURs, and with greater frequency. Fourth, our key focus on handbags and leather goods. Providing incredible value, authenticity, and craftsmanship at scale. Demonstrated by the success of our icons. Such as Tabby, Brooklyn, and Terry. So if I had to summarize, something we talk about a lot here. Coach is a storied brand with over eighty years history winning today, we are winning with a modern client. We're doing this because we are understanding the consumer, we're nurturing creativity, we're operating as a high-performing team, and we're managing with financial rigor.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, Todd. Really displaying disciplined brand building, and then I appreciate it. On Kate Spade, we are taking action, and we're bringing focus to our execution, and we're accelerating our investments to drive that long-term growth. We have made changes. We have a new CEO, Eva Erdman, who's partnering with Sandeep, our chief growth officer, and we're leveraging deeper consumer insights and we're building on the learnings from Coach. You just heard Todd talk about the successes we've built at Coach. We're starting at Kate with focus and streamlining. What we've heard from our customers is the need to remove deselection barriers. Reducing our style counts and we're reducing promotional activity. At the same time, we're leaning into marketing investments to fuel brand interest and ultimately drive new customer acquisition that we know will power our growth in the future. We have work to do. This is a multi-quarter journey, but our strategies are clear and the path to long-term growth is in our control. At Tapestry, we're being disciplined about how we allocate resources and capital. So come back to where we started, we're both fueling Coach and investing across our portfolio for the future. We delivered a strong quarter and raised our outlook, and we're doing that while accelerating investments to reset Kate Spade.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question is from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Hey.\nIke Boruchow: Congrats. Great results. Glad to see it. Two from me, maybe first for Joanne, maybe second for Scott. Just kind of digging a little bit more into Coach, specifically in terms of the robust numbers you guys are putting up. Maybe can you talk about, Joanne, maybe how much did the New York family and Tabby contribute to Coach's growth? What percent of sales do these two families represent? Any more detail there might be helpful. And then follow-up for Scott. Just core drivers of potential margin expansion ahead. How are you thinking about the pace of future gross margin expansion at Coach just following all the recent strength would be helpful.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Sure. I can pick it up. And just let you know that Coach's business is based on really strong foundational principles, and the growth is broad-based. And I think I'll talk it to Todd to cover the details on the business at Coach.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks. I appreciate that. We're so pleased with our platforms. And what's so different about Coach today is we don't have a single platform. We have multiple platforms but they're still very focused. So first, no single platform counts for more than 10% of our sales. Whether that's the Tabby family, whether that's the New York family. So I see a lot of runway with those families as well as Terry in outlet. So we have foundational families that we can drive real business with. Amazing is all of them Terry, Tabby, Brooklyn, are attracting this younger consumer. And so we're attracting this younger consumer across the price spectrum. Which is phenomenal for us. You're gonna Scott's gonna talk about gross margin. I will give a plug. If you think about gross margin, the way we're thinking about it, we just came off of what typically is the highest promotional quarter in our industry. Delivered over 77% gross margin. And, again, that was the highest gross margin in the second quarter in Coach's history. I see incredible sustainable growth in gross margin over the long term. And as we continue to create desirable product, have to use price points. With the scale and the opportunities that the Tapestry supply chain provides. So both on raising price and on reducing our cost, we have a lot of runway left. Scott, hopefully, I left you something on the on the on the boat.\nScott Roe: You know, here's the great news, Todd, is we're in full alignment. Right? This management team prioritizes both gross margin and operating margin. And you know, AUR gross, AUC, which I always say is that most underappreciated part of the story. As our teams look at what consumers really value, we've got using AI for price elasticity. I mean, we're getting a lot more sophisticated as we look at these trade-offs and decisions and that plus the investment in brands brand love. And Todd always says emotion trumps price, and you see that on display, right, with the strong operational beat that we had in gross margin and how that's consolidating into near market-leading operating margins and Coach more than 33%. So what's ahead? You can expect that same basic flywheel. We're gonna grow our gross margins gonna continue to invest in engagement with consumers, which is through increasing marketing and more importantly, more effective marketing and storytelling. And we're balancing the long-term investments with short-term commitments to our shareholders. And I hope you see that's on display with record earnings in the second quarter and a strong beat and raise for the full year. What that means is 200 basis points of gross margin expansion and about 100 basis points in terms of op margin expansion. As we deliver for the short term, but also invest for the long term.\nIke Boruchow: Congrats, guys.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Ike.\nOperator: And our next question is from Adrienne Yih of Barclays.\nAdrienne Yih: Good morning. And let me add my congratulations. Really well done. Joanne, I'm gonna go back to Kate Spade. You know, often when we kind of change the strategy, just wondering who do you envision in Ava envision today is the target market target consumer, kind of how you define her specifically. And then Scott and or Todd, this is kind of a both of you question. So, within Coach, Scott, can you give us can you talk about the AUR lift? Like, how much higher on a five-year basis is AUR? But more specifically, how much of that is actually from lower markdowns how much are your initial retail prices higher versus five years ago then segues to Todd Isn't this the largest spread to pinnacle luxury mean, that we've seen ever covering the space? It just seems like that Europe is testament to the fact you have a whole new market that's sort of been abdicated by Pinnacle Luxury. If you can speak to that, that'd be great. Thanks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah. Thanks, Adrienne, and I'll jump in on Kate Spade. And I would say that it's not so much of a strategy change. The principles of brand building at Tapestry across our portfolio remain intact, and our focus is on sharpening our execution. And as we think about improving that execution, it is in through building more relevance for a target younger consumer. One of the learnings that we've had and our approach is to make sure that we're attracting new customers to the brand, but also new and younger consumers to our brands. Because we know that by 2030, 70% of the consumption in our category will be with new and younger consumers. So we see that as the lifeblood. And as we do deeper consumer research, we're listening and responding and improving our execution behind what we hear to bring more relevance to the brand both in product and in the experiences and storytelling that we develop. And some of the actions we've taken already are showing some traction. We know we need to streamline and focus. What we're hearing from the customer is removing those deselection barriers. Reducing the style counts, that allows us to take big ideas and have them cut through for the consumer and also reducing promotional activity. As we mentioned and as you know and what we see in the market, innovation is winning with the consumer. Continuously hitting the consumer over the head with price is not winning. And so we will sharpen our execution around that as we build the brand and reset the brand. We're also making investments. We're gonna reach our target consumer on the right platform with relevant messaging. And we're leaning into investments there. We see how effective that has been in building brand heat and desire and we're beginning that. We know that's not an overnight change, but we're beginning those investments. And the beauty of it is that we have a strong portfolio. We are beating our estimates. We're raising our outlook, and we're making these changes and investments. And I will end by saying that I'm really excited to partner with Ava. We've brought in a really strong brand builder and the team is very focused on moving quickly behind these actions.\nScott Roe: Yeah. Let me build on that real quick. Yeah. Just put some numbers Adrienne, on the CAE guide. So in the in the quarter, we're down about 10%. We expect the top line trend to be more or less the same. Through the second half of this year. With gross margins continuing to build, moderating a little bit from what we saw in the first. We lapped some of the cost initiatives from a year ago, but still positive in gross margin. And as Joanne just said and we indicated in prepared remarks, significant investment brand building. It'll be the highest percentage brand building as a percentage. Obviously, Coach had absolutely turned as much larger, but the largest percentage increase in what gives us conviction around making that? It's what we've seen on display in Coach. And remember, the phases of this were we're focusing on brand awareness, then we're gonna go followed by customer acquisition and finally growth. Had a beat raise for the full year. Even more importantly, don't lose the thread because we and we're able to not only make these investments in Kate Spade for the long term, but deliver in the short term. To shareholders based on the results that we just printed. I'll throw it to Todd on the AUR question. I think better served by him.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Scott. I chuckle a little bit because in the since FY19, in about the 20 quarters, we've been doing this together, I think 19 of them. We've had an AUR question. I think nine of them we've gone to AUR. So indeed. What's exciting is you and every quarter, like, I did it. Is this it? Is this it? And, you know, we keep hopefully surprising you on the upside. So first, I'm AUR this last do we do? Deliver double-digit handbag growth on AUR and even in North America. So your question is insightful. There's a couple things at play here. Obviously, value matters. And we offer incredible value against maybe traditional European luxury and people are seeing that. And you're seeing it in markets like Europe, where we're seeing double-digit growth because there's value. But I will also say, the value equation is only part of it. You have to have compelling product. You have to say your product has to stand for something. I talk a lot about value and values. Our focus, this timeless Gen Z customer. And we're our insight that we keep developing and how we continue to build on that insight. It is the cornerstone for everything we do. It's the cornerstone that informs Stuart and our design team. It's the cornerstone of our operations, and it's the cornerstone of our storytelling. So excuse me. The value in value is just clear. I see a lot of AUR growth. We obviously don't have to discount product. But also what we've done over these last couple of years is we focus on fewer stories, deeper icons. We don't have to we don't have that vicious cycle of markdowns that historically you have in our space. Because we're reinforcing fewer deeper ideas.\nAdrienne Yih: Fantastic. Well done.\nScott Roe: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.\nMatthew Boss: Thanks, and congrats on a great quarter. So Joanne, with Coach now at a position of strength, as you cited, could you speak to new customer acquisition trends in North America and Greater China and specifically elaborate on opportunities you see to further accelerate growth just given the momentum and clear move to offense. And then, Scott, on the bottom line, earnings this year raised to low to mid-teens. That's your former growth algorithm. Is there any reason that this pace is not sustainable multiyear.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: You know, we are I think that second quarter demonstrates the power of our brand building capabilities. It is the disciplines that we have on display. Coach is leading, Coach is taking share, and it does start with really leaning in to the true essence of the brand understanding our target consumer, and delivering relevant product, emotional product experiences, and storytelling to deepen the engagement with the consumer. And this is a journey that we've been on for years, and we continue to build and hone our capabilities here, and we're driving success. It's not just a customer acquisition that we're after. We're after customer acquisition with a younger consumer. And in the Coach case, with the young timeless, Gen Z consumer. And that's where you see as we get more focused on exactly who our target customer is and bring all of the capabilities of our company, including the incredible innovation and creativity that the teams are delivering. With our commercial capabilities around the world. That is cutting through with our target consumer. We're acquiring more consumers. That accelerated in the quarter. More than half, 60% at Coach for Gen Z, and millennial consumers, and what's interesting about customer acquisition, as you asked, it's these customers are coming into the brand in a healthy way. They're transacting at higher AUR than the average and they're now coming back with more frequency. So building that lifetime value that we value with the young consumer. So that is the focus. It's the focus of our brand building capabilities. And it really starts with having a systemic understanding of the consumer and a continuous learning agenda. And I would say that the teams, while they have success, they continue to stay humble and curious, and we see a second quarter demonstrates, this will drive growth. And we're just getting started. We see more growth ahead. And a lot of opportunity across our portfolio and with Coach.\nScott Roe: And I guess on the second part of the question, Matt, is it sustainable? Short answer, yes. In my opinion. And why do I have conviction? Around that? Well, Todd gave a lot of it, right, which is our continued strength in AUR, our AUC initiatives, and one of the with the best supply chain in the business, gross margin growth. We'll continue to invest, but we also read and react. I think this is an important part. We don't just invest to invest. We invest where we see those indications and that's in our control and we're balancing short term and long term as we think about those investments. And then, obviously, our commitment is to continue to grow earnings. Other thing I'd point out is the strong cash flow yield. You know, we just raised our free cash flow to $1.2 billion. We've got a very strong balance sheet and a lot of options delivering even more shareholder value in the future. Whether it be through buybacks or other actions.\nMatthew Boss: Congrats again.\nScott Roe: Yeah. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to build on the discussion around these powerful new handbag franchises. How do you balance their near-term success with also ensuring that the pipeline is full of new products to take over when those products pass peak?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Go ahead, Todd. I'll let you jump in. Yeah. I'm confident in our innovation pipeline. But, Todd, I'll let you jump in.\nTodd Kahn: You know, it's an interesting phenomenon. We and we recognize this with Tabby, and I think I might have said in prior investor calls. But from 2019, what we started to see Tabby slowdown. And, typically, what would have happened is we would have exited it, it would have gone into outlet. But we would have had the markdown liability a year later, we come out with a new bag called Gabby with the similar attribute. And we'd start the cycle all over again. We stop that cycle. What we did is we took the platform and we innovated in the platform. It was in Tabby's case. We launched Pillow Tabby. Not only did it create an entire new opportunity, it enhanced the original Tabby. We keep doing that more and more. And one of the things I looked at, it was I had a walk through yesterday for fall. The New York family, the Empire, the Brooklyn, we're seeing so much innovation under the platform. That's powerful. And it's cohesive. So when a customer comes in, their choices it tells a compelling story, and you see that with our New York family, which really we're just getting started. New York family is less than a year old. It became the number one bag in the list the first time in our history Coach had two products in the top ten in the list. Conversely, Tabby, we have so much runway. For Tabby. And what I love about Tabby is it has such a distinct hardware in the sculpted C that is ownable and desirable by our clients.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning, and thank you for taking our question. Joanne, Scott, Todd, I was hoping we could dive a little bit deeper in the momentum that you're seeing in China in particular. It sounds like you have a little bit more optimism there than last quarter on an x FX basis. What's working specifically there? What's changing in the execution of your and mortar strategy for Coach, and how should we be thinking about the opportunity to accelerate Coach as well as your other brands in that region going forward. Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Sure. Why don't I kick it off, Brooke? We were pleased to see Greater China return to growth in the second quarter. We delivered low single-digit growth in the quarter significantly outpacing the industry and I think that speaks to the success of our strategies. The brand building capabilities that are working are working globally. And it does underscore the opportunity ahead. We have strong broad-based performance across channels and city tiers in China, the team is importantly bringing the innovation and the value to consumers in that market. Our brand is positioned quite well in the market, and we're investing, including in higher levels of marketing in the region. And we're seeing consumers respond, including younger consumers. So we are driving Gen Z acquisition. So the principles of brand building that are working at Coach are working across the globe. Maybe I'll talk it to Todd if I left you any material to cover how you're thinking about China, but we remain confident in the long-term opportunity overall in China. But, Todd, any color on Coach specifically?\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Joanne. You know, again, we've been in China for over 25 years. We have a depth and a richness to China and understanding in China. We spend a lot of time there. We have amazing people and stores on the ground which really drive everything. And some of the things I've talked about, I think, last call, I mentioned the visit to Wuxi. I know many of you had a better look up where Wuxi was. Small city of nine million people with, you know, three current Coach stores, which opportunity to triple that. That story replicates itself often. This growth of the middle class is so powerful for our brand. Again, going back to value and values, both resonate with this Chinese consumer. So I was so pleased to see a return to growth in China. You're gonna see more growth coming out of China. And in addition to productivity growth as we see increases in traffic. Gonna see distribution growth. We really believe in China. We believe that the Coach brand represents something very special in China. For a number millions and millions of clients. And, again, when you think about people coming of age, eighteen, nineteen, twenty-year-olds, who wanna buy their first bag. We want more than our fair share of that client coming to Coach. We have the right to get them.\nBrooke Roach: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Binetti of Evercore.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys. Let me just add my congrats on a great holiday there, especially Coach North America. Incredible work. I'm sure you guys are proud of it. I just ask you on the path forward on AUR. Is there a point where Brooklyn and Tabby and the franchises that you've spoken about today, all the new consumers you've brought in, the good retention rates, that Joanne talked about start to translate to unit growth. I think if we, you know, back out the AURs you talked about, units are probably still so negatives. Or do you see do you still see the growth coming largely from AUR in the near that's where the momentum is and unit growth would be upside. And then, Scott, just a quick follow-up to you just to help us think about your near-term priorities for high how to think about flow through if the revenue upside does continue. I know you held the SG&A rate to what we were expecting in the quarter, but you were still you still grew the dollars when the revenue came in. It sounded like went to the top of funnel things that can drive the brand going forward. So just how to think about, you know, your priorities for SG&A if you do see upside revenues in the back half. Thanks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah. On AUR and units, your question I think Todd covered the AUR. His confidence in the AUR earlier on the call. Our innovation pipeline is strong. AUR is driving our growth, but we see the opportunity for us. It's an and, not an or. We see the opportunity to drive units going forward both with the expansion of the market and new customer acquisition as well as with, you know, category expansion as these brands continue to drive heat. And maybe toss it to Scott for the flow through.\nScott Roe: Yeah. So I, you know, I can't really give you a definitive answer other than that we will continue to see flow through my we're leaning in where we see real opportunities and for example, we mentioned the Cape where we saw some traction in the campaign with Madison Beer and some of the opportunities leaning in and certainly, we could have made more money. We expect the profit in Kate to be in the 7% range or $85 to $90 million. We could've made that a lot higher but we see the opportunity long term to make that investment. And we can do that while we're still at the Tapestry level delivering significant beats. So we're gonna look at all these investments. You will see flow through. I wouldn't expect a radical change. We've invested where we see that it's prudent, but if other things come up, we'll certainly take those.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question and answer. I will now turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat for some concluding remarks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thank you. Today, we had the opportunity to share our standout holiday results and stronger fiscal 2025 outlook. And what I want to leave you with is a reiteration of our focus and confidence. Coach is an iconic brand, and we're winning with a new generation of consumers around the world. I've never been more confident in the brand and its innovation pipeline. Our success shows that our strategies are working and that a commitment to disciplined brand building drives results. And with this momentum, we're extending our competitive advantages and bringing more focus and investment to Kate Spade. Kate Spade is a unique and beloved brand. We have new leadership, a clear roadmap for long-term growth, and the learnings from Coach to pave our way forward. There is work to do, but we're moving decisively, and we're confident that the path to growth is within our control. Overall, we have a bold ambition to drive accelerated, durable organic growth. And we're focused and confident that the value creation opportunity in front of us is compelling. For our brands, consumers, talented teams, and shareholders. Thank you again to our exceptional global teams for fueling our growth and thank you to everyone who joined us today for your interest in our story. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes Tapestry's earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Global Head of Investor Relations, Christina Colone.\nChristina Colone: Good morning.

Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session, where we will be joined by Todd Kahn, CEO and Brand President of Coach. After Q&A, Joanne will conclude with brief closing remarks. I'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Good morning. Thank you, Christina and welcome everyone. As noted in our press release, our first quarter results exceeded expectations, showcasing the brand magic and operational excellence that are the foundation of our strategic growth agenda. Importantly, our strong and consistent performance is a credit to our exceptional global teams who continue to navigate the dynamic backdrop with focus and agility while positioning our brands and business for the future. Touching on the highlights of the quarter. First, we achieved total revenue in line with prior year on a constant currency basis, outpacing our outlook and reflecting the benefits of our globally diversified business model with continued solid growth at Coach. By geography, we achieved international revenue gains of 2% at constant currency which included an increase of 27% in Europe and a 2% decline in the total APAC region. In Greater China specifically, sales declined 5% consistent with the top end of our guidance range and ahead of the industry which included a sequential trend improvement throughout the quarter. Importantly, we are delivering a high level of innovation, relevance and value to consumers while continuing to invest in our brands, teams and platforms to support long-term growth in the region and with this important consumer cohort. And in North America, revenue declined 1% compared to last year including an anticipated decrease in wholesale while profit rose driven by gross and operating margin expansion. Second, we remain focused on building new and lasting relationships with consumers across our portfolio. During the quarter, we acquired approximately 1.4 million new customers in North America alone, with increases across all brands. Over half of these customers were Gen Z and Millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger consumers to our brands, and they continued to transact at a higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. At the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America, which highlights our ability to successfully engage our existing customer base as we welcome new consumers to our brands. Third, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences engaging our customers wherever they choose to shop our brands. To this end, we maintained strength in digital which grew high single digits versus prior year and represented over 25% of revenue at accretive margins. Our digital business is underpinned by Tapestry's leading capabilities which have enabled us to enhance the customer experience across their purchase journey. Our global brick and mortar sales decreased at a low single digit rate in the quarter as expected though we maintained strong profitability. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence as we remain focused on bringing creativity, quality and compelling value to consumers around the world. This is clearly on display at Coach where we delivered continued growth in handbags with AUR gains underscoring the vibrancy of the brand and product offering. Our success is also reflected in our strong gross margin as we achieved a record first quarter gross margin with further opportunity for expansion long-term. Importantly, underpinning our margin gains is our agile supply chain, a key competitive advantage which enables us to deliver craftsmanship and value globally, while effectively adapting to the rapidly evolving landscape. Overall, we generated record earnings per share which exceeded our expectations, increasing at a double-digit pace compared to the prior year while making strategic investments in our brands and business. Importantly, this outperformance enabled us to raise our guidance for the full year consistent with our commitment to driving growth and shareholder value. Before turning to a discussion of our results in more detail, I'd like to briefly address the pending acquisition of Capri. Two weeks ago, the US District Court granted the FTC's preliminary injunction, which we believe is incorrect on the law and facts. We appealed the decision consistent with our obligations under the merger agreement. While we await that outcome, it's important to reiterate that we are in a position of strength and continue to focus on our compelling organic growth plan, building powerful brands and delivering for our consumers. Now moving to our results and strategies by brand. Coach continued to deliver standout results, highlighting the enduring power and relevance of the brand and its distinctive expressive luxury positioning. Importantly, our teams are driving strong consumer engagement through innovative product, storytelling and experiences fueling our brand heat and growth. To this end, during the quarter, we achieved 2% constant currency revenue gains at exceptional margins highlighted by 330 basis points of gross margin expansion and a 90 basis point lift in operating margin with meaningful runway for growth ahead. Now touching on our progress in the first quarter, centered on our focus to deepen our connection with consumers to fuel continued desire for the brand. First, we grew our leather goods offering. Led by our iconic handbag platforms and the success of new product introductions. The Tabby family once again outperformed over indexing with new and younger consumers and nearly doubling versus last year. The Tabby shoulder bag 26 continued to anchor the offering and we further expanded the family with the introduction of Times Square Tabby. As we shared last quarter. Based on the power of Tabby and in keeping with our commitment to put the consumer at the heart of all we do, we launched a test that brought the Tabby 26 to our outlet channel at full price. This test continues to exceed plan and as a result we rolled it out to more locations with Tabby now available in over 200 outlet stores globally, again at full price. Importantly, the learnings from this test continue to inform our broader strategies for fiscal '25 and beyond as we explore additional opportunities to scale innovative products and marketing campaigns across channels. In addition, during the quarter we launched the New York Family featuring the Brooklyn and Empire bags which surpassed our expectations globally and cemented their place as new pillars for the brand. The Brooklyn shoulder bag 20 at $295 was the top recruitment driver of Gen Z consumers, while the soft Empire Carryall 40 at an AUR of $695 was a viral sensation on TikTok. Importantly, the New York Family is incremental and differentiated with new minimalist branding and soft leather that's clearly resonating with consumers globally. In fact, the early success of Brooklyn earned it a spot on the list, ranking second among the 10 hottest products. Overall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories continued to outpace the industry which included mid single digit AUR gains globally led by North America, and we see further runway longer term given our innovation pipeline and brand heat. Next, we remain focused on fueling lifestyle, expanding the brand's reach and categories including footwear ready and men's, where we are underpenetrated and have a right to win. By driving customer recruitment, purchase frequency and lifetime value. We have a strong pipeline of innovation, notably in footwear with the launch of the new Highline Sneaker in the current quarter. Turning to marketing. We continue to have meaningful conversations with consumers through purpose led marketing, driving cultural relevance and engagement with our brand. This fall we launched a new campaign Unlock Your Courage, featuring Coach ambassadors Elle Fanning, Naza, Young G, and Charles Melton in a series of short films designed to inspire authentic self-expression consistent with our brand mission. Importantly, because of our efforts, we've seen significant gains in unaided awareness, share of search and purchase intent among Gen Z consumers in the US and globally, reinforcing brand momentum and that our strategies are working. In addition, our campaigns and brand building efforts are breaking through globally. To this end, during the quarter, we made the strategic decision to increase our top of funnel marketing investments across international markets, notably in China. This reinforces the confidence we have in our brand and product offering, driving greater consumer engagement and helping to drive outperformance versus the industry in China specifically. In addition, we also drove brand desire through unique experiences. We connected with younger consumers in the world of gaming with a collaboration with Roblox and ZEPETO. Since the launch, more than 12 million unique users interacted with our content and we've seen an increase in brand consideration and purchase intent from consumers on the platform. Overall, our holistic brand building activities helped to drive increases in new customer acquisition as we welcomed approximately 930,000 new customers to Coach in North America, a strong increase versus prior year. Of these new customers, approximately 60% were Gen Z and Millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger customers. Looking ahead to holiday. We will continue to focus on brand building through customer engagement, executing our strategies with discipline. We are confident in our product pipeline, building on the traction we're driving in the business through the continuing success of Tabby, expansion of the New York Family, the launch of newness within our Coach Originals collection, and a compelling assortment of seasonal novelty, reinforced by emotional marketing campaigns that amplify our brand purpose and product. In closing, Coach is a storied brand driving modern relevance fueled by a strong team methodically building sustainable growth. With customer understanding at the heart of our work, we continue to bring to life the brand's unique creativity, purpose and value to a new generation of consumers with significant runway ahead. Now moving to Kate Spade. During the quarter, we continued to reinforce our foundation for the future. While revenue declined as expected, profit margins again expanded versus prior year, led by continued gross margin expansion and diligent expense management. Moving forward, we have a clear imperative for growth. Last month we welcomed new brand CEO, Ava Erdmann to the organization. Ava brings a strong track record of leading global consumer luxury brands and driving consistent profitable growth. Ava and I share confidence in the meaningful opportunities at Kate Spade by bringing a sharpened focus on brand building and enhanced execution. Importantly, under Ava's leadership, the team is working with intention to advance our long-term strategies while acting with urgency to address the things we can immediately improve in support of this vision. Now touching on our results for the quarter. First, we remained focused on strengthening the brand's core handbag offering key to our growth agenda. In September, we launched the Deco Collection in Specialty which is over indexing with new younger consumers at strong AUR and margins. While the Phoebe and Spade Flower programs in outlet remain foundational. At the same time, we also recognize that we need to amplify this progress through more holistic brand building initiatives, ensuring that we are distorting our efforts to telling more focused, cohesive and relevant brand and product stories to drive consumer engagement and that work remains underway. Turning to Kate Spade's lifestyle offering. During the quarter we delivered strong growth in jewelry in keeping with our strategic intent. This growth was driven by Millennial and Gen Z recruitment and we see continued opportunity ahead. Next, we remain focused on maximizing the omnichannel opportunity to drive customer engagement and grow the brand. In keeping with this focus, in October, we launched a trial on Amazon with a range of products including an emphasis on gifting. The initial learnings are promising and we see an opportunity to leverage the platform's broad consumer reach specifically with younger cohorts as we've successfully done with Coach over the last year. Turning to marketing. We are committed to fueling brand heat to drive consideration and accelerate customer acquisition. During the quarter, we acquired approximately 445,000 new customers to the brand, representing an increase versus prior year. That said, we need to drive stronger outcomes, particularly in our core category to achieve our growth ambition. To that end, over the last quarter our team launched new Consumer Insights ethnographic work to sharpen our focus and break through with the brand's target audience. And we've immediately implemented action plans for the holiday and into spring which will bring more focus to our execution, from our assortment to our styling as well as our storytelling efforts. Importantly, we will distort our marketing investment into upper funnel campaigns with more relevant messages for our target customer, capitalizing on the brand's strong unaided awareness in the US to build greater brand desire and purchase consideration. Finally, we also continue to operate with discipline and a focus on maintaining a healthy brand and business which is foundational to our ways of working and highlighted by our continued gross and operating margin expansion in the quarter. Touching on holiday, our goal is to drive customer acquisition through focus and relevancy. To do this, we will lead with gifting, a hallmark of the brand while launching a social first campaign that will celebrate the joy of the holiday season in new and unexpected ways. Overall, while results for Kate Spade met our expectations in the quarter, we're not satisfied with the performance and we're sharpening our roadmap for long-term growth. This is a unique, purpose driven brand with significant potential with consumers on a global scale, and we're leaning in with intention to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Now turning to Stuart Weitzman, we drove revenue gains for the quarter with growth in North America offsetting continued softness in Greater China. Importantly, though financial results remain challenged, we made progress in keeping with our strategic focus on brand building and delivering higher profitability long-term. Touching briefly on our focus areas across product and marketing. During the quarter, new styles including the Vinny Pump and Naomi Boot families resonated with consumers, while growth in flats continued. In addition, we refreshed our iconic styles which remain the bedrock of the brand. We launched new constructions to modernize and enhance the fit of key families including Nudist and Stuart. Product innovation drove traction at wholesale with the business growing double-digits on both a POS and net sales basis in North America in the first quarter. Further, order bookings year-to-date are up nearly 30% to last year. This will support an improvement in revenue and profitability trends this year and beyond, consistent with our strategy to drive growth in this important channel for the brand and category. Turning to marketing. During the quarter, we drove brand desire through emotional storytelling in keeping with the brand's purpose of inspiring strength and confidence. Following the brand's How Lovely to Be a Woman campaign launch featuring new, talented and multifaceted brand ambassadors, we saw an increase in customer acquisition, Google Search and organic digital traffic in North America, which reinforce brand health and represent leading indicators of stronger business results in the future. For holiday, the key boot selling season, we are focused on delivering innovation across our icons and building on the early success of new introductions while driving sustained wholesale growth where there's momentum. In addition, we will continue to deliver purpose driven marketing with the rollout of additional chapters of our How Lovely to Be a Woman campaign. Overall, we continue to see long-term potential for the brand with an empowered team focused on driving customer engagement and improved financial results. In closing, Tapestry delivered strong earnings growth in the first quarter, outperforming expectations. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of brand building, customer centricity and operational excellence. I want to reiterate my appreciation to our exceptional global teams who continue to drive our success. From this position of strength, we raised our outlook for the full year. We remain focused and confident in the bold ambition we have for our existing brands and business. I believe the best is yet to come for Tapestry. Before turning the call over to Scott, I want to take a moment to recognize Andrea Resnick. This marks Andrea's 97th and final earnings call with Tapestry, ahead of her retirement later this year. Andrea joined the company to take it public and has had a truly amazing career. She is an institution at Tapestry and a legend in the IR and Corporate Communication world. Andrea created a gold standard for thoughtful and transparent communications which have become a bedrock at our company. On behalf of everyone at Tapestry, we are grateful for her many contributions and wish her all the best in her next chapter. With that, I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Roe: Thanks, Joanne and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance continued to build on our track record of consistent and disciplined execution. To this end, in Q1, we outperformed expectations across revenue, operating income and earnings, delivering strong EPS growth and cash flow generation, despite the volatile backdrop. Now moving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales were in line with the prior year and above our guidance for the quarter. These results were led by growth internationally which grew 2% at constant currency. By region, Europe, revenue grew 27% above last year, driven by increased local consumer spend and strong new customer acquisition, notably with Gen Z. In other Asia, revenue rose 10% led by growth in Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, while Japan sales declined 4% and in Greater China revenue declined 5% at the high end of our guidance range. During the quarter, we again delivered digital growth and brick and mortar trends while negative improved throughout the quarter, supported by better traffic trends which continued into Q2. Despite the overall challenging market backdrop, we are confidently investing in the region, delivering compelling product and value and positioning our brands and business for long-term growth. In North America, sales declined 1% compared to the prior year due to a planned decrease in wholesale, while North America Direct was positive. Importantly, both gross and operating margins rose versus last year as we supported long-term brand health. Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business was in line with the prior year which included a high single digit increase in digital revenue and a low single digit decline in global brick and mortar sales. Wholesale revenue was in line with prior year which included international growth including on digital platforms where we continue to expand our reach. Moving down the P&L, we achieved a record first quarter gross margin, delivering gross margin expansion of 280 basis points versus prior year. This year-over-year increase was driven by 180 basis points of operational outperformance which exceeded plan as well as a benefit of approximately 60 basis points from lower freight expense and a 40 basis point tailwind from FX. Turning to SG&A. We continue to make ongoing strategic investments in our future. To this end, SG&A rose 3% led by higher marketing spend versus prior year and expectations in support of our brand building initiatives. So taken together, operating margin increased approximately 90 basis points in the quarter, driving operating profit growth ahead of prior year and expectations and first quarter EPS of $1.02 exceeded our guidance and represented growth of 10%. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $7.3 billion which reflects the bond financing related to the proposed acquisition of Capri of $6.1 billion. Free cash flow was an inflow of $94 million. CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing for the quarter were $30 million. Inventory levels at quarter-end were 9% above prior year, reflecting a higher level of in transits consistent with expectations as we continue to leverage the benefits of our supply chain, navigating the Red Sea and port disruptions with only modest impact. Importantly, as we enter the holiday season, our inventory is current and well-positioned globally and we continue to expect to end Q2 and the full year with inventory above prior year. Turning to our dividend program. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share, representing $80 million in dividend payments for the quarter. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to return approximately $325 million to shareholders through the dividend for an annual rate of $1.40 per share. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal year '25 which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are raising our fiscal 2025 outlook which incorporates our first quarter outperformance. We view this guidance as prudent and achievable as we remain clear eyed about the realities of the external environment, balanced with the opportunities we see for our business. For the fiscal year, we now expect revenue of over $6.75 billion representing growth of approximately 1% to 2% versus prior year on a reported and constant currency basis. Touching on sales details by region at constant currency, we expect high teens growth in Europe where we are underpenetrated and have strong traction. In other Asia, we anticipate mid single digit gains, while in Japan we're forecasting a low single digit decline. In North America, we expect revenue to be approximately in line with to slightly above prior year as we continue to support a healthy business. And in greater China, we expect revenue to be in the area of prior year. In addition, our outlook now assumes operating margin expansion of over 50 basis points versus last year. We anticipate gross margin expansion to drive this increase due to improvements in both AUR and AUC, both freight and FX are expected to have a negligible impact on gross margin changes in fiscal '25. On SG&A, we expect expenses to increase roughly in line with the pace of revenue growth for the year. Importantly, we're continuing to diligently control costs while investing in our highest impact growth initiatives including making incremental investments in marketing versus our prior outlook. For modeling purposes, you can expect a modest decline in corporate expenses versus prior year while making ongoing investments in our brands. Moving to below the line expectations for the year. Net interest income is expected to be approximately $20 million which incorporates the Fed's 50 basis point rate cut in September with some further rate cuts assumed throughout the year. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 19%, and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 238 million shares. Taken together, we're raising our EPS guidance to $4.50 to $4.55, representing mid single digit growth compared to last year and ahead of our prior guide of $4.45 to $4.5. Finally, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion excluding any deal related costs, and we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $190 million. We expect around two-thirds of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations, with the balance primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments. Touching on shaping for the year. We expect constant currency sales to be up slightly in the first half of the year with low single digit growth planned in the back half of the year. In Q2, specifically, we expect sales to grow in the area of 1% to 2% on a reported and constant currency basis. Turning to operating margin. We expect expansion in both the first and second halves, with the first half expansion led by gross margin gains and the second half increases driven by SG&A leverage. Taken together, we expect balanced EPS growth of mid single digits for the first and second halves, with Q2 forecasted to approach $1.70. Now to briefly address the proposed acquisition of Capri. We are appealing the district court's order as required by our merger agreement and have paused all integration planning efforts during this period. Given the present dynamics, we are not reaffirming the financial aspects of the deal and will provide updated comments if and as appropriate. With that, I'd like to share with you in more detail how we're thinking about our capital allocation priorities looking forward. Our capital allocation framework is focused on the goals of driving healthy growth and sustainable shareholder value. To do this, we have foundational commitments. First, to invest in our brands and businesses to support long-term sustainable growth. Second is our dividend and we expect to maintain a rate of $1.40 per share in fiscal '25 with a goal over time of increasing our dividend at least in line with earnings to achieve the stated targeted payout ratio of 35% to 40%. Beyond these foundational commitments, our robust cash flow generation provides us with balance sheet flexibility for value creation. To note, we are firmly committed to our solid investment grade rating and our long-term gross leverage target of below 2.5 times. Keeping this long-term leverage target in mind, there's a clear opportunity to utilize excess free cash flow for share repurchases. We have contingency plans ready, pending the outcome of the appeal and we believe our shares represent a compelling opportunity given the strong organic growth runway of our business and this would represent our immediate priority should we be unable to move forward with the proposed acquisition of Capri. And finally, consistent with our commitment to being disciplined financial operators and allocators of capital, we consistently evaluate opportunities for strategic portfolio management utilizing our rigorous four lens framework to ensure all actions meet our strategic and financial growth criteria. In closing, we delivered a successful quarter, demonstrating our commitment to driving disciplined growth. We achieved record gross margin and EPS with double-digit earning gains as we remained focused on executing our compelling organic growth plan, positioning us to raise our outlook for the full fiscal year. Importantly, our distinctive brands, talented global teams, data driven platform and strong cash flow are competitive advantages. Taken together, they provide us with strategic and financial flexibility to deliver accelerated organic growth and enhance shareholder value in fiscal '25 and for years to come. I'd now like to open it up and take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities.\nBob Drbul: Hi, good morning and congratulations on a great quarter. I guess, just the first question really is, can you expand a bit more on the deal, a bit more of an update on the deal. And then, in a deal break scenario, can you just talk through a bit more the vision for the company, your capital allocation priorities, including future M&A. Thanks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to you as well. As you know, on the deal, we filed an appeal as we're required to do by our agreement, and that process is ongoing. As always, we're focused on our organic business, and we're operating from a position of strength. And our outperformance in the first quarter and the outlook we raised for the full year are further evidence of our disciplined brand building and the particular strength we're seeing at Coach. And I do want to recognize the talented teams across the globe at Tapestry who are driving these outstanding results. Together, we have a bold vision for our existing business and we have tremendous runway ahead. And our performance underpins our confidence in our organic growth potential. And our focus is on our largest value creation opportunities. Those are sustaining healthy growth at Coach, while reigniting growth at Kate Spade. And I'm happy to share our thinking on capital allocation. Of course, we're awaiting the outcome of the appeals process, which we're required to do. But in the meantime, I'll give you a little additional color on what Scott walked through on the call. In any scenario, we have foundational investments, and that includes investing in our organic business. And we have much more growth to unlock. And we have a commitment to maintaining our dividend with a goal of increasing it over time. Beyond these commitments, and to directly address your question in a deal break scenario, let me give you three overarching principles that highlight both our balance sheet flexibility and our focus on shareholder return. First, we're firmly committed to our long-term leverage ratio and our investment grade rating. Second, there is meaningful opportunity to resume share repurchases. This would be our immediate priority. Given our free cash flow generation, our growth prospects and our valuation, the buyback opportunity is extremely compelling. And third, strategic portfolio management. We will be disciplined with any actions. We continue to believe our platform can support more brands, and we look forward to proving that in the future. But to be clear, if this deal does not close, we do not expect any M&A in the near term. And before moving forward with M&A, we will ensure Coach remains strong and that we've returned to sustainable top line growth at Kate Spade. We are intensely focused on our existing business and we're confident that we have the creativity, the capabilities and the culture at Tapestry to drive continued success.\nBob Drbul: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, morning everyone. Two questions from me. I'll piggyback off of Bob's. Just understanding, Joanne, very clear on what you were explaining on capacity. Could you give us more specifics? Is it as simple as you guys were kind of annualizing around $700 million in buyback back when the deal was announced. You didn't buy back anything last year. You have nothing in your plan this year. Is it simple enough just to say if the deal did not go through, we should kind of take that number times two and that's what our expectation would be for the appetite. And then the follow up question is just on China, just kind of what you saw through the quarter, what's baked in for the second quarter and just any high-level thoughts on the region would be great.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Sure. Let me take the China question first and then I'll toss it to Scott to add some color on how we're thinking about share buyback. In Greater China, we landed and delivered a quarter at the top end of our guidance range at down 5. Our performance in the region is outpacing the industry. I was just there a couple of months ago, I know Todd was just there a couple of weeks ago. And we continue to invest in the region. We're investing in marketing and our products are resonating the brand purpose, the storytelling. We're delivering exceptional value into the market. And we did see sequential improvement as we moved through the quarter, and we saw that continue into Q2. And importantly, our digital trends were positive in the market. And I think that just speaks to how well our teams on the ground are meeting the customers where they are. They're agile. We've been in the market and I think it speaks to the level of understanding that we have of the customer and the investments we continue to make in our platform and our capabilities. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity in China and in Asia overall. And I'd love to talk it to Todd, but maybe I -- all right, yes. I'll toss it to Todd to give you a little bit more color on what he's seeing in China and then we'll toss it to Scott.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Joanne. And we won't forget your question for Scott. We know how important that is to you. But in terms of China, we delivered a negative 3 in the quarter. That compares to the industry at double-digit over 20% drop. And as Joanne said to you, I've just come back from China. I spent a week there. I have come back more enthusiastic about China than I ever have been. And really, it comes down to our brand positioning of expressive luxury and the value and values that our brands stand for, really resonating with our target customer. And what I was very impressed with, I went to a small city called Wuxi, about two hours outside of Shanghai. When I say a small city, a city of over 7 million people, we have three stores there. We have the opportunity clearly to double our store count there, because we're not restricted by maybe places where only traditional European luxury will go. We're able to go where the young people are and our brand resonates. That story replicates itself in dozens of locations in China. So, I see over the next year and a half, two years, lots of distribution growth opportunity in China. So now let's get to that little question you have about stock buybacks to Scott.\nScott Roe: Yeah. I'm excited to talk about it, Ike. So, I'll start by just reminding you and everybody what Joanne said and just point to our results. I mean, we have a compelling organic story with gross profit, free cash flow and essentially zero net debt. So that means we've got a lot of capacity. And I guess, another contextual point that I would point to is some of the bright lines that we've established. So, we talked about remaining strong investment grade. That means a leverage target of less than two and a half times debt to EBITDA. But in this environment, we wouldn't push the upper limit of that boundary. But it does mean we have a lot of capacity. And some have asked, what vehicles are on the table, would we consider ASR or other things. Yeah, all vehicles are on the table. Should we be in a deal break scenario, then we'll come back with more specificity and give you better parameters around what that might look like.\nIke Boruchow: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks. And congrats on a really nice quarter.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, Matt.\nMatthew Boss: So, Joanne, on market share gains at exceptional margins, which you cited at the Coach brand, could you elaborate on the drivers of outperformance relative to what you're seeing in the category over the past 12 months? And maybe if you could just speak to recent global demand trends that you're seeing. And then, Scott, gross margin. If you could just walk through the continued gross margin opportunities for the balance of this year, and then just how best to think about opportunities remaining multiyear.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah. I'll kick it off, Matt, but also ask Todd to add a little bit of color on the Coach issues specifically. But as I look around the world and what we see in our business is very consistently a consumer that is choice and innovation and emotion, however, are continuing to win with consumers and you have to break through with emotion. We have to deliver value in the way of innovation, great quality and craftsmanship as we do and understand where the customers are, meet them where they are, and that's how we win. We've been very methodical at building the capabilities at Tapestry over time and investing behind our brands. And Coach is clearly winning. As you think about the category, the handbag and leather good category has been incredibly durable and resilient over decades. The category has grown mid single digits over decades. In the last quarter, we did see the category slow and decline in Q1, but again, in that context, Coach is clearly winning. We believe we can grow both now and into the future. And we would expect the handbag category again to resume historic growth rates over time. But even now we expect that we can grow in this environment and then we're building our business to be able to be even stronger as the category more fully recovers to historic growth rates. But I'm going to toss it to Todd to share what he's seeing at Coach.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Joanne. And I'm going to elevate for a second and really talk about Coach and really and by extension how Coach and Tapestry have always excelled at logic. Coach, though, is at its best when the magic is equally strong. I believe we are at one of those moments. And let me give you two proof points which I think speak volumes. First, our own employees are buying the Brooklyn bag in droves, even though it's exempt from our traditional employee discount. And second, in my almost 17 years at Coach, I have never seen consumer demand for a new collection as I've seen for the New York collection with literally tens of thousands of clients registering at stores and online to quote, notify them when a particular colorway or size is back in stock. And the best part is we are not seeing the New York collection cannibalize the demand for our Tabby family. So, when you think about long-term sustainable growth, one, we're acquiring new customers who are younger. Two, they're transacting more frequently at higher AURs. Three, we're creating tested purpose led campaigns that resonate with our target consumers. And four, we've increased our funding for those campaigns to allow a true spike in sustained candidates. And finally, and maybe most importantly, we have meaningful platforms in our product assortment to continue this momentum for the quarters and years ahead. So, I am very bullish on our future now. We're going to stay very close to the consumer. And I think you had a follow up question on gross margin for Scott.\nScott Roe: Yeah. I got it. Boy, that's a great lead in though Todd, in terms of giving the context of why we have such confidence in long-term gross margin growth, but a little bit of shaping, Matt. So, remember what a quarter in Q1 for gross margin with 280 basis points. A couple things to remember. First of all, we did see some benefits from freight. It was highlighted in the prepared remarks about 60 bps in the quarter and we see that turning to a very modest negative and for the full year it's really not much of an impact. But that did benefit Q1. Also as expected, we know that there was some wholesale pressure in Q1 which abates as we go through the year. That's really just a timing year-on-year thing. But obviously that mix benefited us in Q1. That said, we expect gross margins to be up for the year, be the primary driver of our Op margin expansion of about 50 basis points. And remember in the shaping of the year the first half gross margin will be the driver of our profit gain. And as we get in the second half, we start to see more leverage on the SG&A side and that's a bigger contributor in the second half to up margin. And as you look at the structural drivers, I mean, Todd said it right AUR and AUC. AUR investing in the brand's brand heat and our continued ability to get price over time is on display right now. And AUC, which I still believe is one of the underappreciated drivers of gross margin as we use consumer insights in our world-class supply chain to drive efficiency, not cheapen the product, but to get more efficiency and lower the cost throughout the value chain. And that's an additional driver of gross margin that we see on an ongoing basis.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. Joanne, you spoke of a clear imperative for growth at Kate Spade. Can you diagnose the key reasons for its recent declines and then talk to a timeline for stabilizing these sales trends?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, thanks, Lorraine. We have a lot of confidence in the Kate Spade brand and the potential we see for the brand, and the opportunities we see are in brand building and really supporting the innovation that we're delivering. We have a clear bias for action. We are excited to welcome our new CEO, Ava, to the organization last month and she is the perfect leader for the organization with a proven track record of building global luxury brands and building sustainable results. We have set an important foundation at Kate Spade. We're seeing expanded gross margins and operating margins and that's important. We are introducing new product families that are resonating with the consumer. We need to reinforce this work and make those launches and that more impactful with brand building. We're also recruiting new customers to the brand. So, the foundation is there. We need to accelerate and improve our execution. Ava will be sharpening our long-term strategic roadmap as well as improving execution. And we're acting with urgency to impact the things that we can immediately impact, and we covered those a little bit in the call. But that includes marketing, our upper funnel marketing and how we reach and where we reach consumers as well as the storytelling behind the big ideas. We're also making changes on styling and editing our SKUs to be more focused. Those are some of the immediate actions we're taking and we're confident that we have a bright future ahead for Kate.\nScott Roe: And Lorraine, it's Scott, maybe just a quick build. We don't expect growth in this fiscal year. We would expect the trend that we're seeing right now to be more or less in line for the balance of the year. Just to be a little more specific.\nLorraine Hutchinson: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Binetti of Evercore.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions here. So, I guess, just one modeling quick question. As you look at the -- it looks like there's about a $12 million drag on wholesale in the quarter. Scott, I think you referenced it for a second there. Maybe that it gets better through the year. But what was that? Is that just cycling the Amazon sell in and does that remain a drag for a couple quarters? Maybe just any context there. And then if we peel out that wholesale, it looks like Coach direct-to-consumer grew nicely. Are -- maybe just some context on whether the underlying full price and outlet stores are accelerating on an underlying basis?\nScott Roe: Yeah. Sure. You mentioned one of the factors. We did have the pipe fill last year in Amazon and frankly, Michael, it's just timing of orders and when products are dropping from a wholesale. So, I would say while it impacted the quarter there's no new news here. It doesn't represent a fundamental change in the breakdown of the business or any kind of change from a strategic standpoint. And as we look at the year, we'll see that wholesale will grow as will our direct-to-consumer. And I'll start and maybe throw it to Todd in terms of what we're seeing in terms of retail. But yeah, we did see nice growth in our omnichannel, particularly in the online channel in the first quarter, and we expect that to build and even stronger in the Coach brand when we look at the overall direct-to-consumer business. So, maybe, Todd, a little bit more there?\nTodd Kahn: Yeah. Sure. Thank you, Scott. In the first quarter if I strip out the wholesale and the pipe fill from Amazon, Coach globally delivered 3% on constant currency. So, we did better in our direct business. We are seeing good trends through the year. Obviously, led by the Empire Collection, the New York Collection with Empire in Brooklyn and then, of course, the strength of Tabby. We're really seeing great growth in North America. And while we talked about AUR growth which again goes to brand health, we actually saw AUR growth across globally and in North America. So, we're very excited to see the reaction to our product offering. And again, I reinforce this customer acquisition vehicle through our purpose campaigns is the future fuel. So, as we continue to start bringing in new consumers to the Coach family, their lifetime value is so great. It really gives us long-term runway.\nMichael Binetti: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. It's Tracy Cogan [ph] filling in for Paul. I just had a follow up on your comment on AUR. I think, Todd, you mentioned that it was up globally as well as in the US. And I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little more color on how that has varied regionally and what you're expecting for this year for AUR. Any quantification you can give. And then what's driving the AUR increases, how much of it is like for like increases versus adding maybe some bells and whistles to the product. Thanks.\nTodd Kahn: Yeah. I mean, we had mid single digit growth and it was led globally, but it was led by North America. I foresee AUR growth continued throughout the year. It's really a little less about the bells and whistles. It's a couple things. As Scott mentioned and the unsung hero here, is some of how we're going to market. Obviously, we're discounting less. That's an important contributor to it and newness with Brooklyn and the Tabby demand that shapes our business in a different way. We're going to test and see some of the benefit of putting Tabby at full price in outlet. I think that's a driver. When we spend so much on upper funnel marketing and when the focal point is the Tabby bag, the consumer comes into all of our channels of distribution looking for that. And one thing we're learning more and more is consumers don't see channels, they see brand. So, when a consumer comes to Sawgrass Mills for the first time and maybe they're a tourist coming to that Miami area or Woodbury Commons and that's their one shopping experience, they're coming cellphone in hand with a picture of Tabby, they are prepared to pay full price and are so desirous of having that in that channel. So again, once you put everything in a customer centric lens, you see things very differently than the historic norms of our industry.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rick Patel of Raymond James.\nRick Patel: Thank you. Good morning. Can you talk about the shape of growth in North America? Q1 was down 1%. Guidance suggests potential for modest growth this year. Just curious if you can provide color on the progression of growth and the drivers of the implied sequential improvement.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, maybe I'll kick it off and talk it to Scott. But as we talked about, our trends in North America were in fact better than we expected in the first quarter. And we continue to use discipline in managing the business. I would say also we're driving higher gross margins, operating margins and profit dollars, while we're also acquiring new consumers to our brands. So we're operating with a great deal of discipline. The trend in the first quarter was impacted, as we just talked about, by the wholesale drag. And that's a headwind in the first quarter that doesn't repeat for the balance of the year. But maybe, Scott, the shaping of that.\nScott Roe: Well, I think you said it. Really, the underlying trend when you take out the noise from wholesale. And I'll remind you that this is a relatively small quarter too. Right? We do see slight growth balancing the year as wholesale comes back to normal, if I use that word, and the continued underlying direct-to-consumer trends go through the balance of the year.\nRick Patel: Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Altschwager of Baird.\nMark Altschwager: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first, just following up on the channel discussion for North America, did digital outpace brick and mortar for both retail and outlet? And then what are your current thoughts on the distribution footprint for North America, considering there appears to be some increasing product and consumer overlap between the channels. And then separately, Scott, tariffs topic back on the front burner. Can you just remind us of the China sourcing mix and the material changes over the past few years for bags and other categories, and just bigger picture how we should think about mitigation strategies. Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: So let me take your question on digital. Our digital -- I'll start with our direct business. Our omnichannel business did grow or was in line with last year and the first quarter. The digital growth offset a slight decline in our stores. So, our important focus is on meeting the customer where they are and our capabilities allow us to drive our business regardless of where the customer chooses to transact. These are key capabilities that I believe are a competitive advantage for Tapestry. We're well-positioned to meet the customer in digital spaces. That's what you saw in the quarter. And our focus continues to be on our omnichannel business. So, again, omnichannel in line with last year and our wholesale business as well, in line with last year. But international growth really driving that wholesale business. And importantly, globally, the wholesale growth in international is driven by digital and we grew in digital in China. So, this underpins the opportunities that we see to meet the customer where they are. We're moving quickly to meet the customer where they are, and we're acquiring new customers in this channel, which is also very important for our brands going forward. So, a big opportunity for us in customer acquisition. We're acquiring younger customers in these channels. The digital channel for us is accretive in margins to our total. So, those are all capabilities that are important today for our business, for our P&L, but also long-term for our brand.\nScott Roe: Yeah. And let me pick up the question, Mark, on tariffs. So, first of all, I'd say we benefit from having a diverse and agile supply chain. And my goodness, we've had so many disruptions and challenges that have forced us to make adaptions based on port strikes and freight lanes, whatever it might be, tariff regimes changing over time. So, we're pretty well versed in managing through this. We'll see what comes in terms of specific tariffs and other legislation that may come. And we're monitoring that closely and certainly prepared to react. I would point out one thing though. As it relates to China specifically, we have less than 10% of our overall sourcing comes out of China. And when you look at leather goods, it's really minimal. So, from an exposure standpoint, at least as it relates to China, that's really on a relative basis, not a big concern from our standpoint.\nMark Altschwager: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dana Telsey of Telsey Group. Your line is open. Ms. Telsey, your line is open. You may want to check your mute switch.\nDana Telsey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Joanne, as you think about the complexion of the brand and the growth opportunities go forward, given the state of the consumer, how do you think of the balance between introducing newness in core collections and also existing collections? And how do you see pricing evolving and the impact of margin given the current sourcing complex that Scott just mentioned? Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Sure. I'll add my comments, but then toss it to Todd for a little bit of color on what's in fact been working for us in terms of adding newness, but also investing behind our icons. And that is a balance that we talk about and we manage. But the key is that we always have to deliver innovation even within our icons. And you see us building strength on strength in our icons at Coach. Tabby continues to get stronger because we're innovating on that platform. And the iconic original Tabby 26 continues to perform. And then, we're introducing as well newness and innovation that is also working and in fact becoming new pillars for the brand. So, as we think about AUR growth, it's a combination of this magic that Todd talked about of bringing the right product and the right innovation to market with the logic that we're bringing with consumer insights and understanding and all of the data and analytics we bring to bear across our assortment, and then the investments we're making in marketing and maybe I've stolen all of your thunder, Todd, but I'll talk it to you.\nTodd Kahn: You left a little on the bone. So, I think it's very foundational. If we go back four or five years and Joanne and I were on this journey together, we cut the tail of sort of that very one off product, that is foundational to building a future. So, we really looked at how productive every SKU was and we recognized that the big families, a good bag is a good bag globally. So, once we started with that discipline, we then started adding the magic. And Tabby, if you remember, I sent it to you in FY '20, Tabby was starting to slow down. We invigorated the family first with pillow tapping. That reinforced it. So, we're very, very focused on keeping these large families not for a quarter, not for a monthly drop, but for years. We have to balance both the core, because there's still millions of customers who have not yet benefited by owning a core Tabby, which I am keen on selling them. And our marketing people will continue to focus that in our global marketing campaigns. And then, we have our creative teams led by Stuart Vevers, who really keeps very top and center fashion trends. And you can see that evident in the New York collection, which is a completely different aesthetic than Tabby. We joked initially, the New York bag, particularly the Brooklyn bag, didn't have the natural attributes of a great Coach bag. It's not adjustable. The functioning is not as robust as we often think of in a Coach bag. It's not structured. The branding is low key, yet it was exactly the right family for the time and our marketing campaigns. And just the pickup is so strong. So, now instead of just having a Tabby platform, a signature platform, we have this entire New York collection platform that again, will invite and allow more people at compelling prices to come into the Coach family.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Aneesha Sherman of Bernstein.\nAneesha Sherman: Thank you. So, I'm hearing a lot of optimism on organic growth, especially on the Coach brand. And going back to your Investor Day in 2022, your guidance at the time was assuming growth in line with the market, which at the time was mid single digits. Given your increased optimism on customer acquisition and new growth, are you now expecting to grow top line above the market? And then I also have a second question around margin impact of your category mix, especially on Coach. You talked about the innovation pipeline, moving into ready to wear, into footwear, with the sneaker, et cetera. How do you think that's going to impact gross margins going forward? And is there an offset strategy for that? Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah. I'll start and then maybe toss it to Scott on some of your questions on category. But in terms of overall growth and growth versus the category, I think the reality is we are growing faster than the category right now. So, we see an opportunity for us to grow. This is a tremendous category that consumers have an emotional connection to. It has proven to be resilient and durable over time. We love the category we are in, and we have sharpened our execution within our category. And you see that with Coach. We have a tremendous amount of runway in the category to continue to grow Coach. Todd just talked about the opportunities, he's excited about. So, we've got a lot of runway at Coach in the category. And then, if you consider Kate Spade in the category as well, we see tremendous opportunity to continue to unlock growth in our organic business long-term. So, we're very optimistic. And then in terms of categories, I will say one thing about category growth and that is we see opportunity there. It will be incremental. And then I'll toss it to Scott to let you know how he's thinking about it.\nScott Roe: Yeah. That's really the point. I mean, like for like, we will continue to grow margins. The structural drivers AUR, AUC are there. Certain categories just have different and sometimes lower gross margins. But from an operating margin standpoint, certainly we would see that as accretive. And overall, we expect even with this category growth to maintain the exceptional margins that we enjoy today. That's our expectation.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A. Thank you. I will now turn it over to Joanne for some concluding remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, thank you for joining us and for your interest in our story. I want to leave you with three overarching messages today. One, we're operating from a position of strength which is reflected in our first quarter beat in raise. Two, Coach is strong and has momentum. Our brand building efforts and platform capabilities are working. And three, we are focused on our existing business and have competitive advantages that provide us with flexibility, ability to accelerate our organic growth and drive significant value creation. I'm confident in our future and I want to again thank our talented global teams for driving our success. Thanks again and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes Tapestry's earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

I'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Good morning. Thank you, Christina and welcome everyone. As noted in our press release, our first quarter results exceeded expectations, showcasing the brand magic and operational excellence that are the foundation of our strategic growth agenda. Importantly, our strong and consistent performance is a credit to our exceptional global teams who continue to navigate the dynamic backdrop with focus and agility while positioning our brands and business for the future. Touching on the highlights of the quarter. First, we achieved total revenue in line with prior year on a constant currency basis, outpacing our outlook and reflecting the benefits of our globally diversified business model with continued solid growth at Coach. By geography, we achieved international revenue gains of 2% at constant currency which included an increase of 27% in Europe and a 2% decline in the total APAC region. In Greater China specifically, sales declined 5% consistent with the top end of our guidance range and ahead of the industry which included a sequential trend improvement throughout the quarter. Importantly, we are delivering a high level of innovation, relevance and value to consumers while continuing to invest in our brands, teams and platforms to support long-term growth in the region and with this important consumer cohort. And in North America, revenue declined 1% compared to last year including an anticipated decrease in wholesale while profit rose driven by gross and operating margin expansion. Second, we remain focused on building new and lasting relationships with consumers across our portfolio. During the quarter, we acquired approximately 1.4 million new customers in North America alone, with increases across all brands. Over half of these customers were Gen Z and Millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger consumers to our brands, and they continued to transact at a higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. At the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America, which highlights our ability to successfully engage our existing customer base as we welcome new consumers to our brands. Third, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences engaging our customers wherever they choose to shop our brands. To this end, we maintained strength in digital which grew high single digits versus prior year and represented over 25% of revenue at accretive margins. Our digital business is underpinned by Tapestry's leading capabilities which have enabled us to enhance the customer experience across their purchase journey. Our global brick and mortar sales decreased at a low single digit rate in the quarter as expected though we maintained strong profitability. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence as we remain focused on bringing creativity, quality and compelling value to consumers around the world. This is clearly on display at Coach where we delivered continued growth in handbags with AUR gains underscoring the vibrancy of the brand and product offering. Our success is also reflected in our strong gross margin as we achieved a record first quarter gross margin with further opportunity for expansion long-term. Importantly, underpinning our margin gains is our agile supply chain, a key competitive advantage which enables us to deliver craftsmanship and value globally, while effectively adapting to the rapidly evolving landscape. Overall, we generated record earnings per share which exceeded our expectations, increasing at a double-digit pace compared to the prior year while making strategic investments in our brands and business. Importantly, this outperformance enabled us to raise our guidance for the full year consistent with our commitment to driving growth and shareholder value. Before turning to a discussion of our results in more detail, I'd like to briefly address the pending acquisition of Capri. Two weeks ago, the US District Court granted the FTC's preliminary injunction, which we believe is incorrect on the law and facts. We appealed the decision consistent with our obligations under the merger agreement. While we await that outcome, it's important to reiterate that we are in a position of strength and continue to focus on our compelling organic growth plan, building powerful brands and delivering for our consumers. Now moving to our results and strategies by brand. Coach continued to deliver standout results, highlighting the enduring power and relevance of the brand and its distinctive expressive luxury positioning. Importantly, our teams are driving strong consumer engagement through innovative product, storytelling and experiences fueling our brand heat and growth. To this end, during the quarter, we achieved 2% constant currency revenue gains at exceptional margins highlighted by 330 basis points of gross margin expansion and a 90 basis point lift in operating margin with meaningful runway for growth ahead. Now touching on our progress in the first quarter, centered on our focus to deepen our connection with consumers to fuel continued desire for the brand. First, we grew our leather goods offering. Led by our iconic handbag platforms and the success of new product introductions. The Tabby family once again outperformed over indexing with new and younger consumers and nearly doubling versus last year. The Tabby shoulder bag 26 continued to anchor the offering and we further expanded the family with the introduction of Times Square Tabby. As we shared last quarter. Based on the power of Tabby and in keeping with our commitment to put the consumer at the heart of all we do, we launched a test that brought the Tabby 26 to our outlet channel at full price. This test continues to exceed plan and as a result we rolled it out to more locations with Tabby now available in over 200 outlet stores globally, again at full price. Importantly, the learnings from this test continue to inform our broader strategies for fiscal '25 and beyond as we explore additional opportunities to scale innovative products and marketing campaigns across channels. In addition, during the quarter we launched the New York Family featuring the Brooklyn and Empire bags which surpassed our expectations globally and cemented their place as new pillars for the brand. The Brooklyn shoulder bag 20 at $295 was the top recruitment driver of Gen Z consumers, while the soft Empire Carryall 40 at an AUR of $695 was a viral sensation on TikTok. Importantly, the New York Family is incremental and differentiated with new minimalist branding and soft leather that's clearly resonating with consumers globally. In fact, the early success of Brooklyn earned it a spot on the list, ranking second among the 10 hottest products. Overall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories continued to outpace the industry which included mid single digit AUR gains globally led by North America, and we see further runway longer term given our innovation pipeline and brand heat. Next, we remain focused on fueling lifestyle, expanding the brand's reach and categories including footwear ready and men's, where we are underpenetrated and have a right to win. By driving customer recruitment, purchase frequency and lifetime value. We have a strong pipeline of innovation, notably in footwear with the launch of the new Highline Sneaker in the current quarter. Turning to marketing. We continue to have meaningful conversations with consumers through purpose led marketing, driving cultural relevance and engagement with our brand. This fall we launched a new campaign Unlock Your Courage, featuring Coach ambassadors Elle Fanning, Naza, Young G, and Charles Melton in a series of short films designed to inspire authentic self-expression consistent with our brand mission. Importantly, because of our efforts, we've seen significant gains in unaided awareness, share of search and purchase intent among Gen Z consumers in the US and globally, reinforcing brand momentum and that our strategies are working. In addition, our campaigns and brand building efforts are breaking through globally. To this end, during the quarter, we made the strategic decision to increase our top of funnel marketing investments across international markets, notably in China. This reinforces the confidence we have in our brand and product offering, driving greater consumer engagement and helping to drive outperformance versus the industry in China specifically. In addition, we also drove brand desire through unique experiences. We connected with younger consumers in the world of gaming with a collaboration with Roblox and ZEPETO. Since the launch, more than 12 million unique users interacted with our content and we've seen an increase in brand consideration and purchase intent from consumers on the platform. Overall, our holistic brand building activities helped to drive increases in new customer acquisition as we welcomed approximately 930,000 new customers to Coach in North America, a strong increase versus prior year. Of these new customers, approximately 60% were Gen Z and Millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger customers. Looking ahead to holiday. We will continue to focus on brand building through customer engagement, executing our strategies with discipline. We are confident in our product pipeline, building on the traction we're driving in the business through the continuing success of Tabby, expansion of the New York Family, the launch of newness within our Coach Originals collection, and a compelling assortment of seasonal novelty, reinforced by emotional marketing campaigns that amplify our brand purpose and product. In closing, Coach is a storied brand driving modern relevance fueled by a strong team methodically building sustainable growth. With customer understanding at the heart of our work, we continue to bring to life the brand's unique creativity, purpose and value to a new generation of consumers with significant runway ahead. Now moving to Kate Spade. During the quarter, we continued to reinforce our foundation for the future. While revenue declined as expected, profit margins again expanded versus prior year, led by continued gross margin expansion and diligent expense management. Moving forward, we have a clear imperative for growth. Last month we welcomed new brand CEO, Ava Erdmann to the organization. Ava brings a strong track record of leading global consumer luxury brands and driving consistent profitable growth. Ava and I share confidence in the meaningful opportunities at Kate Spade by bringing a sharpened focus on brand building and enhanced execution. Importantly, under Ava's leadership, the team is working with intention to advance our long-term strategies while acting with urgency to address the things we can immediately improve in support of this vision. Now touching on our results for the quarter. First, we remained focused on strengthening the brand's core handbag offering key to our growth agenda. In September, we launched the Deco Collection in Specialty which is over indexing with new younger consumers at strong AUR and margins. While the Phoebe and Spade Flower programs in outlet remain foundational. At the same time, we also recognize that we need to amplify this progress through more holistic brand building initiatives, ensuring that we are distorting our efforts to telling more focused, cohesive and relevant brand and product stories to drive consumer engagement and that work remains underway. Turning to Kate Spade's lifestyle offering. During the quarter we delivered strong growth in jewelry in keeping with our strategic intent. This growth was driven by Millennial and Gen Z recruitment and we see continued opportunity ahead. Next, we remain focused on maximizing the omnichannel opportunity to drive customer engagement and grow the brand. In keeping with this focus, in October, we launched a trial on Amazon with a range of products including an emphasis on gifting. The initial learnings are promising and we see an opportunity to leverage the platform's broad consumer reach specifically with younger cohorts as we've successfully done with Coach over the last year. Turning to marketing. We are committed to fueling brand heat to drive consideration and accelerate customer acquisition. During the quarter, we acquired approximately 445,000 new customers to the brand, representing an increase versus prior year. That said, we need to drive stronger outcomes, particularly in our core category to achieve our growth ambition. To that end, over the last quarter our team launched new Consumer Insights ethnographic work to sharpen our focus and break through with the brand's target audience. And we've immediately implemented action plans for the holiday and into spring which will bring more focus to our execution, from our assortment to our styling as well as our storytelling efforts. Importantly, we will distort our marketing investment into upper funnel campaigns with more relevant messages for our target customer, capitalizing on the brand's strong unaided awareness in the US to build greater brand desire and purchase consideration. Finally, we also continue to operate with discipline and a focus on maintaining a healthy brand and business which is foundational to our ways of working and highlighted by our continued gross and operating margin expansion in the quarter. Touching on holiday, our goal is to drive customer acquisition through focus and relevancy. To do this, we will lead with gifting, a hallmark of the brand while launching a social first campaign that will celebrate the joy of the holiday season in new and unexpected ways. Overall, while results for Kate Spade met our expectations in the quarter, we're not satisfied with the performance and we're sharpening our roadmap for long-term growth. This is a unique, purpose driven brand with significant potential with consumers on a global scale, and we're leaning in with intention to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Now turning to Stuart Weitzman, we drove revenue gains for the quarter with growth in North America offsetting continued softness in Greater China. Importantly, though financial results remain challenged, we made progress in keeping with our strategic focus on brand building and delivering higher profitability long-term. Touching briefly on our focus areas across product and marketing. During the quarter, new styles including the Vinny Pump and Naomi Boot families resonated with consumers, while growth in flats continued. In addition, we refreshed our iconic styles which remain the bedrock of the brand. We launched new constructions to modernize and enhance the fit of key families including Nudist and Stuart. Product innovation drove traction at wholesale with the business growing double-digits on both a POS and net sales basis in North America in the first quarter. Further, order bookings year-to-date are up nearly 30% to last year. This will support an improvement in revenue and profitability trends this year and beyond, consistent with our strategy to drive growth in this important channel for the brand and category. Turning to marketing. During the quarter, we drove brand desire through emotional storytelling in keeping with the brand's purpose of inspiring strength and confidence. Following the brand's How Lovely to Be a Woman campaign launch featuring new, talented and multifaceted brand ambassadors, we saw an increase in customer acquisition, Google Search and organic digital traffic in North America, which reinforce brand health and represent leading indicators of stronger business results in the future. For holiday, the key boot selling season, we are focused on delivering innovation across our icons and building on the early success of new introductions while driving sustained wholesale growth where there's momentum. In addition, we will continue to deliver purpose driven marketing with the rollout of additional chapters of our How Lovely to Be a Woman campaign. Overall, we continue to see long-term potential for the brand with an empowered team focused on driving customer engagement and improved financial results. In closing, Tapestry delivered strong earnings growth in the first quarter, outperforming expectations. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of brand building, customer centricity and operational excellence. I want to reiterate my appreciation to our exceptional global teams who continue to drive our success. From this position of strength, we raised our outlook for the full year. We remain focused and confident in the bold ambition we have for our existing brands and business. I believe the best is yet to come for Tapestry. Before turning the call over to Scott, I want to take a moment to recognize Andrea Resnick. This marks Andrea's 97th and final earnings call with Tapestry, ahead of her retirement later this year. Andrea joined the company to take it public and has had a truly amazing career. She is an institution at Tapestry and a legend in the IR and Corporate Communication world. Andrea created a gold standard for thoughtful and transparent communications which have become a bedrock at our company. On behalf of everyone at Tapestry, we are grateful for her many contributions and wish her all the best in her next chapter. With that, I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Roe: Thanks, Joanne and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance continued to build on our track record of consistent and disciplined execution. To this end, in Q1, we outperformed expectations across revenue, operating income and earnings, delivering strong EPS growth and cash flow generation, despite the volatile backdrop. Now moving to the details of the quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant currency basis. Sales were in line with the prior year and above our guidance for the quarter. These results were led by growth internationally which grew 2% at constant currency. By region, Europe, revenue grew 27% above last year, driven by increased local consumer spend and strong new customer acquisition, notably with Gen Z. In other Asia, revenue rose 10% led by growth in Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, while Japan sales declined 4% and in Greater China revenue declined 5% at the high end of our guidance range. During the quarter, we again delivered digital growth and brick and mortar trends while negative improved throughout the quarter, supported by better traffic trends which continued into Q2. Despite the overall challenging market backdrop, we are confidently investing in the region, delivering compelling product and value and positioning our brands and business for long-term growth. In North America, sales declined 1% compared to the prior year due to a planned decrease in wholesale, while North America Direct was positive. Importantly, both gross and operating margins rose versus last year as we supported long-term brand health. Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business was in line with the prior year which included a high single digit increase in digital revenue and a low single digit decline in global brick and mortar sales. Wholesale revenue was in line with prior year which included international growth including on digital platforms where we continue to expand our reach. Moving down the P&L, we achieved a record first quarter gross margin, delivering gross margin expansion of 280 basis points versus prior year. This year-over-year increase was driven by 180 basis points of operational outperformance which exceeded plan as well as a benefit of approximately 60 basis points from lower freight expense and a 40 basis point tailwind from FX. Turning to SG&A. We continue to make ongoing strategic investments in our future. To this end, SG&A rose 3% led by higher marketing spend versus prior year and expectations in support of our brand building initiatives. So taken together, operating margin increased approximately 90 basis points in the quarter, driving operating profit growth ahead of prior year and expectations and first quarter EPS of $1.02 exceeded our guidance and represented growth of 10%. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $7.3 billion which reflects the bond financing related to the proposed acquisition of Capri of $6.1 billion. Free cash flow was an inflow of $94 million. CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing for the quarter were $30 million. Inventory levels at quarter-end were 9% above prior year, reflecting a higher level of in transits consistent with expectations as we continue to leverage the benefits of our supply chain, navigating the Red Sea and port disruptions with only modest impact. Importantly, as we enter the holiday season, our inventory is current and well-positioned globally and we continue to expect to end Q2 and the full year with inventory above prior year. Turning to our dividend program. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share, representing $80 million in dividend payments for the quarter. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect to return approximately $325 million to shareholders through the dividend for an annual rate of $1.40 per share. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal year '25 which is provided on a non-GAAP basis. We are raising our fiscal 2025 outlook which incorporates our first quarter outperformance. We view this guidance as prudent and achievable as we remain clear eyed about the realities of the external environment, balanced with the opportunities we see for our business. For the fiscal year, we now expect revenue of over $6.75 billion representing growth of approximately 1% to 2% versus prior year on a reported and constant currency basis. Touching on sales details by region at constant currency, we expect high teens growth in Europe where we are underpenetrated and have strong traction. In other Asia, we anticipate mid single digit gains, while in Japan we're forecasting a low single digit decline. In North America, we expect revenue to be approximately in line with to slightly above prior year as we continue to support a healthy business. And in greater China, we expect revenue to be in the area of prior year. In addition, our outlook now assumes operating margin expansion of over 50 basis points versus last year. We anticipate gross margin expansion to drive this increase due to improvements in both AUR and AUC, both freight and FX are expected to have a negligible impact on gross margin changes in fiscal '25. On SG&A, we expect expenses to increase roughly in line with the pace of revenue growth for the year. Importantly, we're continuing to diligently control costs while investing in our highest impact growth initiatives including making incremental investments in marketing versus our prior outlook. For modeling purposes, you can expect a modest decline in corporate expenses versus prior year while making ongoing investments in our brands. Moving to below the line expectations for the year. Net interest income is expected to be approximately $20 million which incorporates the Fed's 50 basis point rate cut in September with some further rate cuts assumed throughout the year. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 19%, and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 238 million shares. Taken together, we're raising our EPS guidance to $4.50 to $4.55, representing mid single digit growth compared to last year and ahead of our prior guide of $4.45 to $4.5. Finally, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion excluding any deal related costs, and we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $190 million. We expect around two-thirds of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations, with the balance primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments. Touching on shaping for the year. We expect constant currency sales to be up slightly in the first half of the year with low single digit growth planned in the back half of the year. In Q2, specifically, we expect sales to grow in the area of 1% to 2% on a reported and constant currency basis. Turning to operating margin. We expect expansion in both the first and second halves, with the first half expansion led by gross margin gains and the second half increases driven by SG&A leverage. Taken together, we expect balanced EPS growth of mid single digits for the first and second halves, with Q2 forecasted to approach $1.70. Now to briefly address the proposed acquisition of Capri. We are appealing the district court's order as required by our merger agreement and have paused all integration planning efforts during this period. Given the present dynamics, we are not reaffirming the financial aspects of the deal and will provide updated comments if and as appropriate. With that, I'd like to share with you in more detail how we're thinking about our capital allocation priorities looking forward. Our capital allocation framework is focused on the goals of driving healthy growth and sustainable shareholder value. To do this, we have foundational commitments. First, to invest in our brands and businesses to support long-term sustainable growth. Second is our dividend and we expect to maintain a rate of $1.40 per share in fiscal '25 with a goal over time of increasing our dividend at least in line with earnings to achieve the stated targeted payout ratio of 35% to 40%. Beyond these foundational commitments, our robust cash flow generation provides us with balance sheet flexibility for value creation. To note, we are firmly committed to our solid investment grade rating and our long-term gross leverage target of below 2.5 times. Keeping this long-term leverage target in mind, there's a clear opportunity to utilize excess free cash flow for share repurchases. We have contingency plans ready, pending the outcome of the appeal and we believe our shares represent a compelling opportunity given the strong organic growth runway of our business and this would represent our immediate priority should we be unable to move forward with the proposed acquisition of Capri. And finally, consistent with our commitment to being disciplined financial operators and allocators of capital, we consistently evaluate opportunities for strategic portfolio management utilizing our rigorous four lens framework to ensure all actions meet our strategic and financial growth criteria. In closing, we delivered a successful quarter, demonstrating our commitment to driving disciplined growth. We achieved record gross margin and EPS with double-digit earning gains as we remained focused on executing our compelling organic growth plan, positioning us to raise our outlook for the full fiscal year. Importantly, our distinctive brands, talented global teams, data driven platform and strong cash flow are competitive advantages. Taken together, they provide us with strategic and financial flexibility to deliver accelerated organic growth and enhance shareholder value in fiscal '25 and for years to come. I'd now like to open it up and take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities.\nBob Drbul: Hi, good morning and congratulations on a great quarter. I guess, just the first question really is, can you expand a bit more on the deal, a bit more of an update on the deal. And then, in a deal break scenario, can you just talk through a bit more the vision for the company, your capital allocation priorities, including future M&A. Thanks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to you as well. As you know, on the deal, we filed an appeal as we're required to do by our agreement, and that process is ongoing. As always, we're focused on our organic business, and we're operating from a position of strength. And our outperformance in the first quarter and the outlook we raised for the full year are further evidence of our disciplined brand building and the particular strength we're seeing at Coach. And I do want to recognize the talented teams across the globe at Tapestry who are driving these outstanding results. Together, we have a bold vision for our existing business and we have tremendous runway ahead. And our performance underpins our confidence in our organic growth potential. And our focus is on our largest value creation opportunities. Those are sustaining healthy growth at Coach, while reigniting growth at Kate Spade. And I'm happy to share our thinking on capital allocation. Of course, we're awaiting the outcome of the appeals process, which we're required to do. But in the meantime, I'll give you a little additional color on what Scott walked through on the call. In any scenario, we have foundational investments, and that includes investing in our organic business. And we have much more growth to unlock. And we have a commitment to maintaining our dividend with a goal of increasing it over time. Beyond these commitments, and to directly address your question in a deal break scenario, let me give you three overarching principles that highlight both our balance sheet flexibility and our focus on shareholder return. First, we're firmly committed to our long-term leverage ratio and our investment grade rating. Second, there is meaningful opportunity to resume share repurchases. This would be our immediate priority. Given our free cash flow generation, our growth prospects and our valuation, the buyback opportunity is extremely compelling. And third, strategic portfolio management. We will be disciplined with any actions. We continue to believe our platform can support more brands, and we look forward to proving that in the future. But to be clear, if this deal does not close, we do not expect any M&A in the near term. And before moving forward with M&A, we will ensure Coach remains strong and that we've returned to sustainable top line growth at Kate Spade. We are intensely focused on our existing business and we're confident that we have the creativity, the capabilities and the culture at Tapestry to drive continued success.\nBob Drbul: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, morning everyone. Two questions from me. I'll piggyback off of Bob's. Just understanding, Joanne, very clear on what you were explaining on capacity. Could you give us more specifics? Is it as simple as you guys were kind of annualizing around $700 million in buyback back when the deal was announced. You didn't buy back anything last year. You have nothing in your plan this year. Is it simple enough just to say if the deal did not go through, we should kind of take that number times two and that's what our expectation would be for the appetite. And then the follow up question is just on China, just kind of what you saw through the quarter, what's baked in for the second quarter and just any high-level thoughts on the region would be great.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Sure. Let me take the China question first and then I'll toss it to Scott to add some color on how we're thinking about share buyback. In Greater China, we landed and delivered a quarter at the top end of our guidance range at down 5. Our performance in the region is outpacing the industry. I was just there a couple of months ago, I know Todd was just there a couple of weeks ago. And we continue to invest in the region. We're investing in marketing and our products are resonating the brand purpose, the storytelling. We're delivering exceptional value into the market. And we did see sequential improvement as we moved through the quarter, and we saw that continue into Q2. And importantly, our digital trends were positive in the market. And I think that just speaks to how well our teams on the ground are meeting the customers where they are. They're agile. We've been in the market and I think it speaks to the level of understanding that we have of the customer and the investments we continue to make in our platform and our capabilities. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity in China and in Asia overall. And I'd love to talk it to Todd, but maybe I -- all right, yes. I'll toss it to Todd to give you a little bit more color on what he's seeing in China and then we'll toss it to Scott.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Joanne. And we won't forget your question for Scott. We know how important that is to you. But in terms of China, we delivered a negative 3 in the quarter. That compares to the industry at double-digit over 20% drop. And as Joanne said to you, I've just come back from China. I spent a week there. I have come back more enthusiastic about China than I ever have been. And really, it comes down to our brand positioning of expressive luxury and the value and values that our brands stand for, really resonating with our target customer. And what I was very impressed with, I went to a small city called Wuxi, about two hours outside of Shanghai. When I say a small city, a city of over 7 million people, we have three stores there. We have the opportunity clearly to double our store count there, because we're not restricted by maybe places where only traditional European luxury will go. We're able to go where the young people are and our brand resonates. That story replicates itself in dozens of locations in China. So, I see over the next year and a half, two years, lots of distribution growth opportunity in China. So now let's get to that little question you have about stock buybacks to Scott.\nScott Roe: Yeah. I'm excited to talk about it, Ike. So, I'll start by just reminding you and everybody what Joanne said and just point to our results. I mean, we have a compelling organic story with gross profit, free cash flow and essentially zero net debt. So that means we've got a lot of capacity. And I guess, another contextual point that I would point to is some of the bright lines that we've established. So, we talked about remaining strong investment grade. That means a leverage target of less than two and a half times debt to EBITDA. But in this environment, we wouldn't push the upper limit of that boundary. But it does mean we have a lot of capacity. And some have asked, what vehicles are on the table, would we consider ASR or other things. Yeah, all vehicles are on the table. Should we be in a deal break scenario, then we'll come back with more specificity and give you better parameters around what that might look like.\nIke Boruchow: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks. And congrats on a really nice quarter.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, Matt.\nMatthew Boss: So, Joanne, on market share gains at exceptional margins, which you cited at the Coach brand, could you elaborate on the drivers of outperformance relative to what you're seeing in the category over the past 12 months? And maybe if you could just speak to recent global demand trends that you're seeing. And then, Scott, gross margin. If you could just walk through the continued gross margin opportunities for the balance of this year, and then just how best to think about opportunities remaining multiyear.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah. I'll kick it off, Matt, but also ask Todd to add a little bit of color on the Coach issues specifically. But as I look around the world and what we see in our business is very consistently a consumer that is choice and innovation and emotion, however, are continuing to win with consumers and you have to break through with emotion. We have to deliver value in the way of innovation, great quality and craftsmanship as we do and understand where the customers are, meet them where they are, and that's how we win. We've been very methodical at building the capabilities at Tapestry over time and investing behind our brands. And Coach is clearly winning. As you think about the category, the handbag and leather good category has been incredibly durable and resilient over decades. The category has grown mid single digits over decades. In the last quarter, we did see the category slow and decline in Q1, but again, in that context, Coach is clearly winning. We believe we can grow both now and into the future. And we would expect the handbag category again to resume historic growth rates over time. But even now we expect that we can grow in this environment and then we're building our business to be able to be even stronger as the category more fully recovers to historic growth rates. But I'm going to toss it to Todd to share what he's seeing at Coach.\nTodd Kahn: Thanks, Joanne. And I'm going to elevate for a second and really talk about Coach and really and by extension how Coach and Tapestry have always excelled at logic. Coach, though, is at its best when the magic is equally strong. I believe we are at one of those moments. And let me give you two proof points which I think speak volumes. First, our own employees are buying the Brooklyn bag in droves, even though it's exempt from our traditional employee discount. And second, in my almost 17 years at Coach, I have never seen consumer demand for a new collection as I've seen for the New York collection with literally tens of thousands of clients registering at stores and online to quote, notify them when a particular colorway or size is back in stock. And the best part is we are not seeing the New York collection cannibalize the demand for our Tabby family. So, when you think about long-term sustainable growth, one, we're acquiring new customers who are younger. Two, they're transacting more frequently at higher AURs. Three, we're creating tested purpose led campaigns that resonate with our target consumers. And four, we've increased our funding for those campaigns to allow a true spike in sustained candidates. And finally, and maybe most importantly, we have meaningful platforms in our product assortment to continue this momentum for the quarters and years ahead. So, I am very bullish on our future now. We're going to stay very close to the consumer. And I think you had a follow up question on gross margin for Scott.\nScott Roe: Yeah. I got it. Boy, that's a great lead in though Todd, in terms of giving the context of why we have such confidence in long-term gross margin growth, but a little bit of shaping, Matt. So, remember what a quarter in Q1 for gross margin with 280 basis points. A couple things to remember. First of all, we did see some benefits from freight. It was highlighted in the prepared remarks about 60 bps in the quarter and we see that turning to a very modest negative and for the full year it's really not much of an impact. But that did benefit Q1. Also as expected, we know that there was some wholesale pressure in Q1 which abates as we go through the year. That's really just a timing year-on-year thing. But obviously that mix benefited us in Q1. That said, we expect gross margins to be up for the year, be the primary driver of our Op margin expansion of about 50 basis points. And remember in the shaping of the year the first half gross margin will be the driver of our profit gain. And as we get in the second half, we start to see more leverage on the SG&A side and that's a bigger contributor in the second half to up margin. And as you look at the structural drivers, I mean, Todd said it right AUR and AUC. AUR investing in the brand's brand heat and our continued ability to get price over time is on display right now. And AUC, which I still believe is one of the underappreciated drivers of gross margin as we use consumer insights in our world-class supply chain to drive efficiency, not cheapen the product, but to get more efficiency and lower the cost throughout the value chain. And that's an additional driver of gross margin that we see on an ongoing basis.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. Joanne, you spoke of a clear imperative for growth at Kate Spade. Can you diagnose the key reasons for its recent declines and then talk to a timeline for stabilizing these sales trends?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, thanks, Lorraine. We have a lot of confidence in the Kate Spade brand and the potential we see for the brand, and the opportunities we see are in brand building and really supporting the innovation that we're delivering. We have a clear bias for action. We are excited to welcome our new CEO, Ava, to the organization last month and she is the perfect leader for the organization with a proven track record of building global luxury brands and building sustainable results. We have set an important foundation at Kate Spade. We're seeing expanded gross margins and operating margins and that's important. We are introducing new product families that are resonating with the consumer. We need to reinforce this work and make those launches and that more impactful with brand building. We're also recruiting new customers to the brand. So, the foundation is there. We need to accelerate and improve our execution. Ava will be sharpening our long-term strategic roadmap as well as improving execution. And we're acting with urgency to impact the things that we can immediately impact, and we covered those a little bit in the call. But that includes marketing, our upper funnel marketing and how we reach and where we reach consumers as well as the storytelling behind the big ideas. We're also making changes on styling and editing our SKUs to be more focused. Those are some of the immediate actions we're taking and we're confident that we have a bright future ahead for Kate.\nScott Roe: And Lorraine, it's Scott, maybe just a quick build. We don't expect growth in this fiscal year. We would expect the trend that we're seeing right now to be more or less in line for the balance of the year. Just to be a little more specific.\nLorraine Hutchinson: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Binetti of Evercore.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions here. So, I guess, just one modeling quick question. As you look at the -- it looks like there's about a $12 million drag on wholesale in the quarter. Scott, I think you referenced it for a second there. Maybe that it gets better through the year. But what was that? Is that just cycling the Amazon sell in and does that remain a drag for a couple quarters? Maybe just any context there. And then if we peel out that wholesale, it looks like Coach direct-to-consumer grew nicely. Are -- maybe just some context on whether the underlying full price and outlet stores are accelerating on an underlying basis?\nScott Roe: Yeah. Sure. You mentioned one of the factors. We did have the pipe fill last year in Amazon and frankly, Michael, it's just timing of orders and when products are dropping from a wholesale. So, I would say while it impacted the quarter there's no new news here. It doesn't represent a fundamental change in the breakdown of the business or any kind of change from a strategic standpoint. And as we look at the year, we'll see that wholesale will grow as will our direct-to-consumer. And I'll start and maybe throw it to Todd in terms of what we're seeing in terms of retail. But yeah, we did see nice growth in our omnichannel, particularly in the online channel in the first quarter, and we expect that to build and even stronger in the Coach brand when we look at the overall direct-to-consumer business. So, maybe, Todd, a little bit more there?\nTodd Kahn: Yeah. Sure. Thank you, Scott. In the first quarter if I strip out the wholesale and the pipe fill from Amazon, Coach globally delivered 3% on constant currency. So, we did better in our direct business. We are seeing good trends through the year. Obviously, led by the Empire Collection, the New York Collection with Empire in Brooklyn and then, of course, the strength of Tabby. We're really seeing great growth in North America. And while we talked about AUR growth which again goes to brand health, we actually saw AUR growth across globally and in North America. So, we're very excited to see the reaction to our product offering. And again, I reinforce this customer acquisition vehicle through our purpose campaigns is the future fuel. So, as we continue to start bringing in new consumers to the Coach family, their lifetime value is so great. It really gives us long-term runway.\nMichael Binetti: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. It's Tracy Cogan [ph] filling in for Paul. I just had a follow up on your comment on AUR. I think, Todd, you mentioned that it was up globally as well as in the US. And I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little more color on how that has varied regionally and what you're expecting for this year for AUR. Any quantification you can give. And then what's driving the AUR increases, how much of it is like for like increases versus adding maybe some bells and whistles to the product. Thanks.\nTodd Kahn: Yeah. I mean, we had mid single digit growth and it was led globally, but it was led by North America. I foresee AUR growth continued throughout the year. It's really a little less about the bells and whistles. It's a couple things. As Scott mentioned and the unsung hero here, is some of how we're going to market. Obviously, we're discounting less. That's an important contributor to it and newness with Brooklyn and the Tabby demand that shapes our business in a different way. We're going to test and see some of the benefit of putting Tabby at full price in outlet. I think that's a driver. When we spend so much on upper funnel marketing and when the focal point is the Tabby bag, the consumer comes into all of our channels of distribution looking for that. And one thing we're learning more and more is consumers don't see channels, they see brand. So, when a consumer comes to Sawgrass Mills for the first time and maybe they're a tourist coming to that Miami area or Woodbury Commons and that's their one shopping experience, they're coming cellphone in hand with a picture of Tabby, they are prepared to pay full price and are so desirous of having that in that channel. So again, once you put everything in a customer centric lens, you see things very differently than the historic norms of our industry.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rick Patel of Raymond James.\nRick Patel: Thank you. Good morning. Can you talk about the shape of growth in North America? Q1 was down 1%. Guidance suggests potential for modest growth this year. Just curious if you can provide color on the progression of growth and the drivers of the implied sequential improvement.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, maybe I'll kick it off and talk it to Scott. But as we talked about, our trends in North America were in fact better than we expected in the first quarter. And we continue to use discipline in managing the business. I would say also we're driving higher gross margins, operating margins and profit dollars, while we're also acquiring new consumers to our brands. So we're operating with a great deal of discipline. The trend in the first quarter was impacted, as we just talked about, by the wholesale drag. And that's a headwind in the first quarter that doesn't repeat for the balance of the year. But maybe, Scott, the shaping of that.\nScott Roe: Well, I think you said it. Really, the underlying trend when you take out the noise from wholesale. And I'll remind you that this is a relatively small quarter too. Right? We do see slight growth balancing the year as wholesale comes back to normal, if I use that word, and the continued underlying direct-to-consumer trends go through the balance of the year.\nRick Patel: Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Altschwager of Baird.\nMark Altschwager: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, first, just following up on the channel discussion for North America, did digital outpace brick and mortar for both retail and outlet? And then what are your current thoughts on the distribution footprint for North America, considering there appears to be some increasing product and consumer overlap between the channels. And then separately, Scott, tariffs topic back on the front burner. Can you just remind us of the China sourcing mix and the material changes over the past few years for bags and other categories, and just bigger picture how we should think about mitigation strategies. Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: So let me take your question on digital. Our digital -- I'll start with our direct business. Our omnichannel business did grow or was in line with last year and the first quarter. The digital growth offset a slight decline in our stores. So, our important focus is on meeting the customer where they are and our capabilities allow us to drive our business regardless of where the customer chooses to transact. These are key capabilities that I believe are a competitive advantage for Tapestry. We're well-positioned to meet the customer in digital spaces. That's what you saw in the quarter. And our focus continues to be on our omnichannel business. So, again, omnichannel in line with last year and our wholesale business as well, in line with last year. But international growth really driving that wholesale business. And importantly, globally, the wholesale growth in international is driven by digital and we grew in digital in China. So, this underpins the opportunities that we see to meet the customer where they are. We're moving quickly to meet the customer where they are, and we're acquiring new customers in this channel, which is also very important for our brands going forward. So, a big opportunity for us in customer acquisition. We're acquiring younger customers in these channels. The digital channel for us is accretive in margins to our total. So, those are all capabilities that are important today for our business, for our P&L, but also long-term for our brand.\nScott Roe: Yeah. And let me pick up the question, Mark, on tariffs. So, first of all, I'd say we benefit from having a diverse and agile supply chain. And my goodness, we've had so many disruptions and challenges that have forced us to make adaptions based on port strikes and freight lanes, whatever it might be, tariff regimes changing over time. So, we're pretty well versed in managing through this. We'll see what comes in terms of specific tariffs and other legislation that may come. And we're monitoring that closely and certainly prepared to react. I would point out one thing though. As it relates to China specifically, we have less than 10% of our overall sourcing comes out of China. And when you look at leather goods, it's really minimal. So, from an exposure standpoint, at least as it relates to China, that's really on a relative basis, not a big concern from our standpoint.\nMark Altschwager: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dana Telsey of Telsey Group. Your line is open. Ms. Telsey, your line is open. You may want to check your mute switch.\nDana Telsey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Joanne, as you think about the complexion of the brand and the growth opportunities go forward, given the state of the consumer, how do you think of the balance between introducing newness in core collections and also existing collections? And how do you see pricing evolving and the impact of margin given the current sourcing complex that Scott just mentioned? Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Sure. I'll add my comments, but then toss it to Todd for a little bit of color on what's in fact been working for us in terms of adding newness, but also investing behind our icons. And that is a balance that we talk about and we manage. But the key is that we always have to deliver innovation even within our icons. And you see us building strength on strength in our icons at Coach. Tabby continues to get stronger because we're innovating on that platform. And the iconic original Tabby 26 continues to perform. And then, we're introducing as well newness and innovation that is also working and in fact becoming new pillars for the brand. So, as we think about AUR growth, it's a combination of this magic that Todd talked about of bringing the right product and the right innovation to market with the logic that we're bringing with consumer insights and understanding and all of the data and analytics we bring to bear across our assortment, and then the investments we're making in marketing and maybe I've stolen all of your thunder, Todd, but I'll talk it to you.\nTodd Kahn: You left a little on the bone. So, I think it's very foundational. If we go back four or five years and Joanne and I were on this journey together, we cut the tail of sort of that very one off product, that is foundational to building a future. So, we really looked at how productive every SKU was and we recognized that the big families, a good bag is a good bag globally. So, once we started with that discipline, we then started adding the magic. And Tabby, if you remember, I sent it to you in FY '20, Tabby was starting to slow down. We invigorated the family first with pillow tapping. That reinforced it. So, we're very, very focused on keeping these large families not for a quarter, not for a monthly drop, but for years. We have to balance both the core, because there's still millions of customers who have not yet benefited by owning a core Tabby, which I am keen on selling them. And our marketing people will continue to focus that in our global marketing campaigns. And then, we have our creative teams led by Stuart Vevers, who really keeps very top and center fashion trends. And you can see that evident in the New York collection, which is a completely different aesthetic than Tabby. We joked initially, the New York bag, particularly the Brooklyn bag, didn't have the natural attributes of a great Coach bag. It's not adjustable. The functioning is not as robust as we often think of in a Coach bag. It's not structured. The branding is low key, yet it was exactly the right family for the time and our marketing campaigns. And just the pickup is so strong. So, now instead of just having a Tabby platform, a signature platform, we have this entire New York collection platform that again, will invite and allow more people at compelling prices to come into the Coach family.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Aneesha Sherman of Bernstein.\nAneesha Sherman: Thank you. So, I'm hearing a lot of optimism on organic growth, especially on the Coach brand. And going back to your Investor Day in 2022, your guidance at the time was assuming growth in line with the market, which at the time was mid single digits. Given your increased optimism on customer acquisition and new growth, are you now expecting to grow top line above the market? And then I also have a second question around margin impact of your category mix, especially on Coach. You talked about the innovation pipeline, moving into ready to wear, into footwear, with the sneaker, et cetera. How do you think that's going to impact gross margins going forward? And is there an offset strategy for that? Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah. I'll start and then maybe toss it to Scott on some of your questions on category. But in terms of overall growth and growth versus the category, I think the reality is we are growing faster than the category right now. So, we see an opportunity for us to grow. This is a tremendous category that consumers have an emotional connection to. It has proven to be resilient and durable over time. We love the category we are in, and we have sharpened our execution within our category. And you see that with Coach. We have a tremendous amount of runway in the category to continue to grow Coach. Todd just talked about the opportunities, he's excited about. So, we've got a lot of runway at Coach in the category. And then, if you consider Kate Spade in the category as well, we see tremendous opportunity to continue to unlock growth in our organic business long-term. So, we're very optimistic. And then in terms of categories, I will say one thing about category growth and that is we see opportunity there. It will be incremental. And then I'll toss it to Scott to let you know how he's thinking about it.\nScott Roe: Yeah. That's really the point. I mean, like for like, we will continue to grow margins. The structural drivers AUR, AUC are there. Certain categories just have different and sometimes lower gross margins. But from an operating margin standpoint, certainly we would see that as accretive. And overall, we expect even with this category growth to maintain the exceptional margins that we enjoy today. That's our expectation.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A. Thank you. I will now turn it over to Joanne for some concluding remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, thank you for joining us and for your interest in our story. I want to leave you with three overarching messages today. One, we're operating from a position of strength which is reflected in our first quarter beat in raise. Two, Coach is strong and has momentum. Our brand building efforts and platform capabilities are working. And three, we are focused on our existing business and have competitive advantages that provide us with flexibility, ability to accelerate our organic growth and drive significant value creation. I'm confident in our future and I want to again thank our talented global teams for driving our success. Thanks again and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes Tapestry's earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Global Head of Investor Relations, Christina Colone.\nChristina Colone: Good morning. Thank you for joining us.

Following that, we will hold a question-and-answer session, where we will be joined by Todd Kahn, CEO and Brand President of Coach. After Q&A, Joanne will conclude with brief closing remarks. I'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, our fourth quarter results exceeded expectations, capping a successful year. This is a testament to our passionate global teams whose creativity and exceptional execution continue to fuel our brands and business. They are navigating the current environment with focus and agility, while meaningfully advancing our long-term growth initiatives. Touching on the highlights of the fiscal year. First, we delivered total revenue growth of 1% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the benefits of our globally diversified business model. These top-line results were led by International growth of 6% at constant currency, with gains across key regions, including increases of 14% in Europe, 9% in Other Asia and 5% in Japan, which together represent nearly 20% of Tapestry sales with additional runway for growth. In Greater China, sales rose 3% for the year, as anticipated, which included declines in the second half as we anniversaried last year's strong growth of over 30%. Although the recovery in China has been more gradual than what we originally expected entering fiscal year '24, we continued to invest in our brands, teams and platforms to support our long-term strategic growth agenda in the region and with this important consumer cohort. And in North America, revenue declined 1% compared to last year, while profit rose, driven by gross and operating margin expansion. Second, we remained focused on building new and lasting relationships with consumers by cultivating emotional connections with our brands. During the year, we acquired over 6.5 million new customers in North America alone, of which over half were Gen Z and Millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger consumers to our brands. And we continue to see new customers transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. At the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America, which highlights our ability to successfully engage our existing customer base as we drive new customer recruitment. Third, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences, meeting and delighting our customers wherever they choose to shop. To this end, our global brick and mortar sales rose for the year on a constant currency basis. Importantly, this growth was driven by an increase in productivity across a fleet, which is highly profitable. In addition, we maintained our strong digital positioning with sales more than 3 times pre-pandemic levels, representing nearly 30% of revenue at accretive margins. Our digital business is powered by Tapestry's leading capabilities, which have enabled us to enhance the consumer experience across their purchase journey. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence as we remain focused on bringing the creativity, quality and compelling value required to win with consumers. Nowhere was this more evident than at Coach, where we delivered record annual revenue, including growth in handbags with AUR gains, underscoring the strength of our brand and product offering. Our success is also reflected in our strong gross margin delivery, as we achieved our highest annual gross margin in over 15 years. Overall, we generated record fiscal year earnings per share, which outperformed our expectations, growing at a double-digit pace compared to the prior year, while making strategic investments in our brands and business. Moving forward from this solid foundation, our organization is embracing even greater ambition for the future, reinforcing a culture of innovation and accountability. We are taking action to accelerate growth at Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, while building on the momentum of Coach, positioning us for long-term profitable growth. To this end, we've made two key changes to our executive leadership team. Sandeep Seth, CMO of Coach, has expanded his role to include a newly created position of Chief Growth Officer for Tapestry. Since joining Coach in 2021, he has been instrumental in working alongside Todd Kahn and Stuart Vevers in driving the brand's growth and evolution, including the successful launch of the expressive luxury repositioning. Sandeep will partner with me and our executive leadership team to strengthen the focus on growth across our portfolio, bringing deeper consumer insights into our strategies and building distinctive brand worlds. And earlier this month, we announced the appointment of Eva Erdmann as CEO and Brand President, Kate Spade, effective in October. Eva is a proven brand builder and transformative leader, and I look forward to welcoming her to the organization. Before turning to a discussion of our results in more detail, I'd like to address the pending acquisition of Capri. While we are confident that this combination remains an exceptional strategic fit, there is significant work to do to bring innovation to their brands and reinvigorate their business amid their disappointing decline in standalone results. We believe we're well positioned to execute our integration plans and growth strategies, and that the path to value creation is clear and compelling under our ownership, bringing meaningful benefits to our customers, employees, partners and shareholders around the world. With that, I'll now touch on results and go-forward strategies across each of our brands, starting with Coach. Coach continues to build strength on strength, highlighting the power of expressive luxury. Throughout the year, our teams fueled brand heat and desire, notably with younger consumers, enabling Coach to achieve record annual revenue, which surpassed $5 billion at exceptional margins with significant runway for growth ahead. Now touching on some details of the fourth quarter. With consumer insights at the heart of our work, our talented design and creative teams under Stuart Vevers' leadership once again delivered a range of innovative product offerings that distinguish the brand. To this end, we continued to drive growth in our handbag offering, led by our iconic platforms. The Tabby family delivered another quarter ahead of our expectations, over-indexing with new and younger consumers and nearly doubling versus last year. Quilted Tabby continued to outperform and we further expanded the family with the introduction of the Tabby Backpack. During the quarter, the success of Tabby earned it a coveted spot on the list, ranking third among the 10 hottest products globally and helping to secure Coach's position on the list index for hottest brands, where it was recognized for its unique ability to offer luxury experiences that are inclusive and attainable. Further, given the power and halo of Tabby and consistent with our goal of meeting consumers where they are, we broke the distribution paradigm through a test that brought Tabby 26 to over 100 outlet locations globally, selling at full price, and the test is exceeding our plan. Importantly, the learnings from this test are informing our broader strategies in fiscal '25 and beyond as we explore additional opportunities to scale innovative products and marketing campaigns across channels. Beyond Tabby, our heritage Willow and Rogue families remain foundational volume drivers. We also launched newness with the Juliet shoulder bag, while our viral sensation, The Coach Original Swing Zip continued to resonate strongly with Gen Z customers. Overall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories outpaced the industry for the year, which included AUR gains globally and in North America, and we see further runway longer term given our innovation pipeline and brand heat. Touching on AUR details for the fourth quarter. Coach's global handbag AUR was even with prior year at constant currency impacted by geographic mix headwinds, while North America handbag AUR growth remained positive. Next, we continued to build out the lifestyle assortment, expanding the brand's reach with consumers with the goal of powering customer recruitment, purchase frequency and ultimately lifetime value. Footwear drove outsized gains driven by the continued success of the low line sneaker as well as the recently launched Brynn Sandal. In ready to wear, we achieved growth with traction in leather jackets, amplifying Coach's positioning as America's original house of leather. And in men's, we animated the League family with the flap, backpack and messenger styles leading with consumers. Turning to marketing, we remained focused on storytelling under the brand's purpose, Courage to be Real. As part of the strategy, this spring we launched the brand's Find Your Courage campaign, featuring Coach ambassadors that inspire consumers to embrace self-expression. By extending our top of funnel activations, we're creating continuous and meaningful conversations with consumers, building emotional connections with the brand and driving cultural relevance. Importantly, as a result of these efforts, we've seen significant gains in unaided awareness, consideration and purchase intent among Gen Z consumers, reinforcing that our strategies are working. Further, we launched unique and immersive retail experiences across the globe, highlighting our commitment to consumer engagement through experiences beyond product. We're also connecting with younger consumers through immersive platforms and virtual experiences in the world of gaming, with a recently debuted collaboration with Roblox and Zepeto in keeping with our goal of innovating in new spaces for the brand. Overall, our holistic brand building activities helped to drive increases in new customer acquisition as we welcomed approximately 4.2 million new customers to Coach this year in North America. This included over 1 million new customers in the fourth quarter, of which approximately 60% were Gen Z and Millennials. At the same time, we've seen significant gains in Google search trends in the US, a clear signal of the brand's momentum. As we enter a new fiscal year, our priorities are clear. We will continue to deepen our connection with consumers, grow leather goods, fuel gains across lifestyle with a focus on footwear, lead with purpose-led storytelling through high impact and sustained brand building campaigns, and expand retail experiences to bring expressive luxury to life through engaging the five senses. These pillars have driven our success and are the right strategies to take us into the future. In closing, Coach is an iconic brand driving modern relevance with brand momentum that is translating into strong financial results. Building on our record year, we are confident in the bright future ahead and our ability to drive healthy sustainable growth as we continue to bring this storied brand to a new generation of consumers. Now moving to Kate Spade. During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategies and reinforce our foundation for the future. While top-line results were challenged, profit once again rose significantly versus prior year, led by continued gross margin expansion and disciplined expense management. Moving forward, we are laser-focused on realizing the full potential of the brand. Importantly, as mentioned, I look forward to welcoming Eva to the organization this fall. She brings a deep understanding of the rapidly evolving consumer landscape and a demonstrated ability to cultivate desire, cultural relevance and passionate communities for distinctive luxury brands. I'm confident that Eva, working alongside the team in place, will enhance our execution to drive sustainable profitable growth. Now touching on our results of the quarter in more detail. First, we remain focused on strengthening the brand's core handbag offering through innovative product and distinctive brand codes. During the quarter, we expanded the Grace family and specialty along with the Phoebe and Spade Flower programs and outlet. These families are resonating with our target consumer and will represent foundational elements of our assortment going forward as our pipeline of newness continues to grow. We also recognize that to successfully drive our product strategies, we need to amplify these efforts through more comprehensive brand building initiatives, including holistic marketing campaigns that build engagement with the brand and its products. Turning to Kate Spade's lifestyle offering, which is a differentiator for the brand. During the quarter, we delivered growth in jewelry, driven by millennial and Gen Z recruitment as well as repeat purchasing and gifting. In addition, in June, we opened the brand's first dedicated jewelry location in London, a test which will provide learnings as we explore the opportunity for growth in the category. Second, we powered the omnichannel experience to drive customer engagement. As you know, in fiscal year '24, we launched a katespadeoutlet.com site, replacing the brand's surprise site and providing a better experience for outlet consumers to discover and shop the brand online. The outlet digital channel grew in the quarter with growth in both new and existing customers at higher margins. Third, we remain focused on creating emotional marketing to fuel brand relevance and heat. During the year, we acquired nearly 2.3 million new customers in North America, including nearly 500,000 new customers during the fourth quarter. Accelerating this progress will be key to our success. To this point, we will continue to distort our investment to top- and mid-funnel marketing to support brand building and growth, particularly with younger audiences, where we are seeing unaided awareness improve with Gen Z consumers. Finally, throughout the year, we maintained a commitment to operational excellence, which underpin the brand's meaningful gross margin and profit expansion. This is structural to our business and an integral part of our go-forward strategy. Turning to our strategic initiatives for fiscal year '25, we have a clear imperative for growth. To achieve this, in the year ahead, we will fuel brand heat to drive consideration and accelerate customer acquisition, strengthen the core handbag foundation, grow lifestyle and maximize the omni channel opportunity. Overall, Kate Spade is a unique and purpose-driven brand with distinctive position in the marketplace and significant expansion opportunities. Its mission of bringing joy to consumers around the world is powerful and we continue to have a relentless drive to deliver sustainable profitable growth. Now turning to Stuart Weitzman. Our results for the year were challenged, significantly impacted by external pressures in the brand's two key markets of North America and Greater China. Despite disappointing financial results, we continued to focus on brand-building initiatives to drive awareness, growth and profitability long term. Touching briefly on our focus areas across product and marketing. During the quarter, we expanded our assortment of sophisticated casual styles, highlighted by momentum in flats. Additionally, we continued to extend the brand's reach through gains in new and emerging categories, including men's and handbags. Importantly, new innovation is driving traction at wholesale with the business growing double-digits at POS in North America in Q4. Further, order bookings through the Spring '25 season are up over 30% to last year. This will support an improvement in revenue and profitability trends in the year ahead. Finally, during the quarter, we remained focused on driving brand relevancy through emotional storytelling in keeping with the brand's ethos of inspiring strength and confidence. Overall, we saw an increase in aided awareness, Google search and social engagement in the US for both the quarter and the year, which represent leading indicators of stronger business results in the future. Looking ahead to fiscal year '25, the Stuart Weitzman team is prioritizing fueling brand relevancy with emotional storytelling, growing their icons and key item platforms while further expanding casual and new categories and accelerating growth in wholesale where there's clear traction. Overall, we see long-term potential for the brand with an empowered team focused on delivering improved top- and bottom-line performance. In closing, Tapestry delivered record full year earnings per share, outperforming expectations and once again demonstrating the power of brand-building, customer-centricity and operational excellence. I want to reiterate my gratitude to our incredible teams globally who continue to drive our success. From this position of strength, we have a bold vision for the future. We know that the landscape is rapidly evolving. Consumers have an incredible amount of choice, and they're exercising those choices every day. We also know that the most successful brands are winning on innovation and emotion. And in this environment, we're well positioned to compete and win. Beyond our organic growth opportunities, there is a clear and compelling path to value creation through the acquisition of Capri, leveraging our platform and leadership to bring meaningful benefits to customers, employees, partners and shareholders around the world. Importantly, we also understand that all great visions require great execution. The year ahead will again require agility and adaptability, controlling the factors we can and managing our business responsibly to drive long-term growth. While we are not immune to macroeconomic and other external factors, we can define our own destiny, given our distinctive brands, talented global teams and strong cash flow. These differentiators provide us with strategic and financial flexibility to continue to deliver enhanced value in fiscal year '25 and for years to come. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Roe: Thanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Looking back at our results for the fiscal year, our commitment to disciplined growth remains on display. We drove an increase in constant-currency revenue, expanded gross margin 250 basis points while investing in future growth drivers for our brands and business and grew EPS at 11% versus last year to a record earnings per share of $4.29. Now moving to the details of the fourth quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant-currency basis. Sales were in line with the prior year and above our guidance for the quarter. These results were led by growth internationally on top of strong double-digit gains from the prior year. By region, Europe grew 26% above last year with strength across channels, including higher spend from local consumers and tourists. In Other Asia, revenue rose 12% with notable growth in Malaysia, Australia and Korea. And in Japan, sales grew 2% with an increase in Chinese consumer spend. In Greater China, revenue declined 10% as anticipated, as we lapped 50% growth a year-ago and continued to navigate a more challenging consumer backdrop in the region. Importantly, and despite these headwinds, we did continue to drive growth in digital channels. In North America, sales declined 1% compared to the prior year, amid a challenging consumer backdrop, while both gross and operating margin rose significantly versus last year as we supported long-term brand health. Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business decreased 2%, amid our overall declines in North America and Greater China, while wholesale grew as expected, increasing 14%. Moving down the P&L, we delivered our strongest fourth quarter gross margin in over 15 years, beating our expectations and expanding 250 basis points versus prior year. This year-over-year expansion was driven by operational outperformance, a benefit of approximately 90 basis points from lower freight expense as well as FX tailwinds. SG&A rose 3%, including the previously disclosed timing shift of $20 million from the third quarter into Q4, which primarily related to marketing. Importantly, we continue to tightly control costs, while making ongoing strategic investments in our brands, people and business platforms. So, taken together, operating margin declined approximately 40 basis points in the quarter. And our fourth quarter EPS of $0.92 exceeded our expectations with roughly half of that beat due to operational upside and half due to a lower tax rate. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the year with $7.2 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $7.2 billion, which reflects the bond financing related to the planned acquisition of Capri of $6.1 billion as well as the early paydown of the company's $450 million term loan in the fiscal fourth quarter. Free cash flow for the year was an inflow of over $1.1 billion, or $1.3 billion excluding deal-related costs. CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing for the fiscal year were $144 million. Inventory levels at year-end were 10% below the prior year, reflecting both strong inventory control as well as a shift in receipt timing into our fiscal '25 first quarter. Looking forward, our inventory is well-controlled and current, and we continue to leverage the benefits of our supply chain, navigating the Red Sea disruption with only modest impact. While we expect inventories to be elevated in Q1 due to higher-end transits, the full year is expected to end modestly above prior year levels. Turning to our dividend program. For the fiscal year, we returned $321 million to shareholders through the dividend at an annual rate of $1.40 per share, a 17% increase compared to last year and a dividend payout ratio equal to 39% on a reported basis. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal year '25 on a non-GAAP basis. We've taken a prudent approach to our outlook, balancing the realities of the external environment with the opportunities we see for our business. It's important to note that we view this as our baseline. It does not incorporate any accretion related to the pending acquisition of Capri. For the fiscal year, we expect revenue in the area of $6.7 billion, representing growth compared to the prior year on a reported basis, including approximately 50 basis points of currency pressure. On a constant-currency basis, revenue is expected to increase approximately 1% versus the prior year, consistent with the trend in fiscal year '24. Touching on sales details by region at constant currency. We expect mid-teens growth in Europe and mid-single-digit gains in Other Asia, with North America, Greater China and Japan each planned in the area of prior year. In addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion in the area of 50 basis points versus last year. We anticipate gross margin to expand approximately 40 basis points due to operational improvements. Freight is expected to have a negligible impact on gross margin changes in fiscal year '25. On SG&A, we expect expenses to be roughly in line with the prior year, representing slight leverage. Importantly, we're continuing to diligently control costs while investing in our highest impact growth initiatives. For modeling purposes, you can expect corporate expenses to decline versus prior year and drive leverage. Moving to the below the line expectations for the year. Net interest income is expected to be approximately $20 million, which incorporates the fourth quarter paydown of our $450 million term loan and the yield on our growing cash balances with some rate cuts assumed throughout the year. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 238 million shares. So taken together, we project EPS of $4.45 to $4.50, representing mid-single-digit growth compared to last year. And bridging versus our fiscal 2025 EPS target previously provided at our Investor Day in 2022, our guidance incorporates a negative impact of $0.35 related to the suspension of share repurchase activity due to the proposed acquisition of Capri, as previously outlined, and an estimated currency headwind of approximately $0.20. Finally, before contemplating any deal-related costs, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $190 million. We expect around two-thirds of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations with the balance primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments. Touching on shaping for the year, we expect constant-currency sales to be flat in the first half of the year, with modest growth planned in the back half of the year as we anniversary easier compares in Greater China. In Q1 specifically, we expect constant-currency sales to be down in the area of 2%, due primarily to lower wholesale shipments in North America in the quarter, which is timing for the year as well as mid to high single-digit decline in Greater China. On a reported basis, we expect revenue to be down approximately 3%, including FX headwinds. As mentioned, we expect gross margin expansion for the year, led by the first half with the most significant improvement planned in Q1, benefiting from operational tailwinds. SG&A dollars are expected to be roughly flat with last year in both the first and second halves of the year, including in Q1. We anticipate leverage planned in the back half on the expected growth in revenue. Net interest income is anticipated for the first half with net zero impact planned for the second half, which assumes rate cuts as discussed. Taken together, we expect balanced EPS growth of mid-single-digits for both the first and second halves with Q1 forecasted to approach $0.95. Now to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are unchanged. First, we will invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth. Second, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We're committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. To this end, we're confirming our long-term leverage target of less than 2.5 times on a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA basis and expect to achieve that within two years of the Capri transaction close. And finally, we will return capital to shareholders through our dividend. Importantly, we believe our strong cash flow profile provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return. Following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future. Before closing, I'd like to touch on the acquisition of Capri. Since we announced the deal a year ago, the Capri business has been significantly pressured, reporting disappointing results. Having said that, it remains an excellent strategic fit and value creation opportunity. First, we continue to believe these are iconic brands with long-term growth potential. Second, as time has progressed, we've developed growing conviction in the opportunities for synergies, adapting our integration planning and strategies. In addition, over the course of the year, Tapestry's standalone business has outperformed and we expect this to continue. Therefore, in looking at the full picture, the deal remains compelling despite more near-term headwinds than expected. Importantly, we expect EPS accretion on an adjusted basis in year one, enhanced cash flow, compelling ROIC and are firmly committed to achieving our stated leverage target in 24 months post-close. In closing, we delivered a successful year advancing our strategies and building on our track record of operational excellence to drive double-digit EPS gains and strong free cash flow against a dynamic backdrop. Moving forward, we continue to focus on controlling the controllables, remaining agile and committed to driving healthy, sustainable growth and shareholder returns, leveraging the power of our operating model and talented global teams. I'd now like to open it up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities.\nBob Drbul: Hi. Good morning, and congratulations on a strong year at Tapestry. When you look at your results in comparison to Capri's recently, given that underperformance, can you just talk about your commitment to the deal and your thinking? Has it changed around the level of financial returns? I know you spoke to it a bit, Scott, but I was wondering if you guys could expand a little bit more. Thanks.\nScott Roe: Joanne, you're muted.\nOperator: And it does appear that Joanne has disconnected from the call.\nScott Roe: Okay. Let me jump in here, Bob, and just take the second part of your question first. On Capri's standalone results, yeah, you're right, the level of underperformance that they have announced is disappointing and surprising, frankly, particularly as it relates to the flow-through to profitability and cash flow. But this is really an execution opportunity. I hope you see that what we've displayed within our business is agility and the ability to get after expenses and right-size and we see this as a real opportunity. But with that, just notably to pick on the biggest brand or to point out the biggest brand, Michael Kors, despite all these declines in top-line and profitability, it's still a business that has an operating income in the high teens. Second, on the combination, as we said in the prepared remarks, it's still a strong strategic fit. But let me be clear, and financially, the metrics, it is accretive to our baseline EPS, offers double-digit ROIC over our planning horizon, and we're firmly committed to hitting our deleverage targets and maintaining investment-grade even despite the results that have been recently printed. And lastly, as you think about our approach to integration, I mean, I guess one advantage of having this time as we've gone through the FTC process is we've had even more time for integration planning, for doing outside analysis. And based on that, our conviction over the synergies continues to increase. We have even more conviction on what this combination means from a synergy standpoint. So that...\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Hey, Scott?\nScott Roe: Yeah, go ahead.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: I'm sorry about that technical glitch. I am back on the call, so I appreciate it. And to add, Bob, to the points that Scott was making, we do have conviction, but I wanted to touch for a minute on our results because you did mention the contrast in our results versus theirs. So, I think the results we delivered today where I know the results speak to our focus on brand-building, consumer centricity and the excellent execution that our teams are delivering. And I do want to remind you that we delivered the highest gross margin in the company in over 15 years. We delivered double-digit EPS growth and strong free cash flow, and we have momentum at our largest brand, Coach. And as we scan the landscape today, we know that companies and brands that are innovating and executing are winning, and you see that in our results. So that puts us in a position of strength, and it underpins our confidence in the path ahead. And to your question on the acquisition, I know Scott took us through the numbers and how we're thinking about accretion, but this combination remains an excellent strategic fit. And we see compelling long-term value creation opportunity under our ownership. To your point, their standalone results have been surprising and disappointing to us. Our priority is to reinvigorate the business and we believe we're well positioned to do that. These are iconic brands, and to drive growth will bring a stronger focus on the consumer to deliver more innovation and more relevance, and these are areas that we have a proven ability to execute. And as Scott covered the financials, we have a realistic understanding of the financials and confidence in our ability to execute and drive value creation long-term with this transaction.\nBob Drbul: Great. Thank you very much. Good luck with it.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.\nIke Boruchow: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, similar to Bob, just a question around the deal. I guess just, Scott, you kind of alluded to it to Bob's question and on the prepared remarks about synergies. I mean, is it fair to say, we're about a year into this, have you done enough work to believe that there's upside to the synergy target you guys initially guided to should the deal go through? And then, just a quick follow-up would be, what is -- if the deal does not go through, can you just help us understand what is Plan B for you guys in terms of operations, your balance sheet and use of cash? We just kind of love to know how you guys are thinking through the different scenarios. Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Maybe I'll kick it off, Ike, and then pass it to Scott again. We do have both strategic and financial strength and flexibility at Tapestry. We have multiple paths to value creation. Using your words, Plan A is this transaction and the deal is compelling and a significant value creation opportunity for us as I just outlined. But equally important is we entered this transaction from a position of strength. We have a growing organic business, strong earnings delivery and significant cash flow that allows for us to invest in our business and our brands and return capital. So, maybe I'll pass it to Scott to add any details on our capital allocation priorities.\nScott Roe: Yeah, sure. So, while Plan A is our priority, should we find ourselves in the Plan B scenario, a couple of things I'd just remind you of Ike. So first of all, our free cash flow strength, and if you look over the year just reported and our guidance for this year kind of averaging in that $1.2 billion from free cash flow, think of that as an ongoing baseline for the underlying profitability of the business, a little over $300 million in dividends, $325 million. That gives us more than $800 million of excess cash, which can be deployed against those capital allocation priorities. And should we find ourselves in that situation and given the current valuation, obviously, buybacks are a pretty compelling option for us to consider in that four-lens framework. The other question you asked me was synergies. I'm not prepared to give you a number. I would just reiterate what I said that more than $200 million, we have even more conviction. So, you can assume that means that we're looking at potentially even more synergies from this deal. Upon closing, we'll come back and give you more illumination on what that looks like.\nIke Boruchow: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Boss of JPMorgan.\nMatt Boss: Great. Thanks. So, Joanne, could you elaborate on current health of the Coach brand in North America? Maybe any changes in customer behavior in the category that you've seen so far in the first quarter? And just how current trends have shaped your view for 2025 in the region? And then quickly for Scott, on gross margin, I guess, how best to think about AUR opportunity or any change in the promotional landscape that you've embedded in your 2025 plan?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Hey, Matt. I'll touch on the consumer, but then toss it to Todd maybe for a few comments on Coach. We couldn't be more confident and excited about the positioning of Coach, but I won't steal Todd's thunder. As we look at the consumer, we're seeing consistency from what we've seen really in the last few quarters, and that's a consumer that's choiceful. What we see in the market is that innovation and emotion continue to win and that puts heightened importance on brand execution and brand heat, where we're meeting the high bar -- that customers' high bar for innovation, we're winning. We talked about the consumer acquisition in the quarter, 1.6 million customers, in the year, 6.5 million new customers to the brand. And we continue to invest in brand building and innovation to ensure we're cutting through with consumers and winning. Where we're doing that, we're seeing the consumer respond. We see it across channels and across income cohorts. So, a continuation really of what we've been seeing, particularly in North America. But Todd, do you want to touch on Coach?\nTodd Kahn: Yeah, thanks. First, in North America, Coach delivered slight growth in the fourth quarter, and it was -- at incredible margins, and it was led by our retail full price business. When you scale out for a second, there are very, very few brands that are at our level of volume that are growing, that deliver 76%-plus gross margin, and just to refresh your recollection, that's 600 basis points above FY '19. And when you get to the reasons why, we can do that because of four overarching attributes. First, expressive luxury is working with our myopic focus on timeless Gen Z. Second, product innovation. Product innovation is just incredible. You see it with Tabby. You may have noticed a recent bag we launched called Brooklyn. Brooklyn is part of the New York family. It is -- has a very different attitude than Tabby, and it's incremental. And around the shop, we like to say no sleep till Brooklyn, New York becomes the next Tabby family. And lastly, the compelling storytelling in our marketing coupled with what really is our underlying strength. We have a team of operators who know how to be commercially successful. And that bodes well for Coach's future, but it also bodes well for the bench we're creating for Tapestry's future.\nScott Roe: And a very brief add to your specific question as it relates to what's driving gross margin, it's really the structural drivers that you saw on display in the year just closed, continue into next year. Yeah, AUR is a part of that. Also AUC as we continue to find efficiencies throughout the supply chain and that's probably an underappreciated part of our gross margin story as we think about structural advantages going forward.\nMatt Boss: Great. Best of luck.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. I wanted to touch on Kate Spade for a minute. You spoke of a need to amplify the efforts there through holistic marketing campaigns. Does this imply a need for further investment to fuel a turnaround, or do you think you can continue the margin progress as you turn sales?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Good morning, Lorraine. We expect to build on the foundation that we've set over the last few years and our focus is really to accelerate the growth in the top-line. As we said in our prepared remarks, Kate is a unique brand. It has a distinctive positioning in the marketplace. And the opportunities we see to expand the top-line are very clear. We have a clear imperative for growth from here through brand building. And as we talked about, it's not just about bringing the innovation, which is required for -- from consumers today, we have to bring the innovation, but we also have to cut through with holistic marketing and brand building. We are investing in the brand. So, even as we're delivering higher gross margins, operating margins and profit dollars, which we did in fiscal '24, we're doing that while investing in the brand. So, you'll see us continue to invest in the brand, but also continue to expand margins as we work to improve the top-line performance of the brand. And we look forward to welcoming Eva in October.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning, and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping we could touch on China. Can you elaborate on the health of your brands in the China marketplace? What you're seeing in the quarter-to-date period? And perhaps outline the most important drivers of a return to growth within your outlook into the second half?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, we are building and continue to drive a healthy business. That's been our focus not only in China, but around the world and I think evidenced in our margin delivery that continues at Tapestry, but like many others, we're seeing macro headwinds impacting the landscape. Despite this, we did grow in fiscal '24. And as we think about the forward view, we are expecting the market to be basically in line in fiscal '25 with where it was in '24. But we -- our long-term view on China and the opportunity that exists in that market has not changed. We're taking a prudent approach in the short term in how we're planning and in our guidance, but we continue to stay close to the consumer. Our teams are moving as that consumer is moving. We're building the business in a very healthy way in the market. And maybe I'll toss it to Todd to give some color around what we're seeing at Coach specifically.\nTodd Kahn: Thank you, Joanne, and good morning, Brooke. Building on what Joanne said, we are very, very bullish on the mid- and long-term view on China. And we still see that as our best opportunity by region for meaningful growth. And what I particularly like is where the Coach brand is positioned. As we've seen traditional European luxury soften in China, our relevancy, we're getting -- we're giving that consumer an incredible value at a very fashionable -- with a very fashionable product. I'd say sometimes we don't need China to create 10 million millionaires. We need China to provide us with 10 million people that can buy a $500 bag. That's a materially different space. And we're -- so I see over the coming years, productivity gains, and I also see real opportunities for distribution gains in second- and third-tier cities where again we show up so well. We're very relevant to the consumer. We're very focused on their desire. So, I'm very, very bullish on China over the long term.\nBrooke Roach: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Binetti of Evercore ISI.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Just a quick one on AUR and another question. Just you said flat in the quarter, but it was largely geography mix. Maybe where you're seeing the pressure? How durable you think those pressures are? And if there's a path to AUR being up in totality in '25? And then, on the gross margin, just to unpack it a little bit more, nice increase in fourth quarter. I think you said of the 250 basis points, 90 basis points was freight. Maybe how much of it was FX? And then, what goes away as we roll into fourth quarter, what comes back? And you said the first quarter will be -- will expand the most from I think, Scott, you said operational tailwinds. Maybe just double-click on that and where you see the opportunity from here for the Coach brand multi-year, given the record levels?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, I'll start at a high level, but briefly. What supports AUR, excuse me, is the innovation and the investments we're making in brand building. And we see that today and where we're delivering that innovation, we're winning and our brand building efforts are paying off. We're acquiring new customers and younger customers importantly. And those customers are coming into our brands and at higher AUR and strong margins. So, those investments that we're making are paying off. The work that we do is structural to our business and I'm staying close to the consumer leveraging data, but it's that balance of magic and logic that we continue to bring. That's structural. And that's what gives us confidence in the future for both gross margin and AUR. But Todd, I don't know if you want to make some comments about Coach specifically.\nTodd Kahn: Yeah. You touched on so many important things, but I understand when you look at it and we love celebrating that we had the highest sales in our history and exceeded $5 billion. And 11 years ago was the last time we exceeded $5 billion or just touched on it. We're doing it in such a brand healthy way today. You see it in our gross margin. You see it in our commitment under our, what we call, Coach-genomics to put our -- that gross margin to work, reducing our non-marketing SG&A and putting it in marketing to do exactly what Joanne just said, bring in a relevant younger new customer who experiences the brand at -- with a lot of brand heat and a lot of elevation. So, I see our path forward to be really robust. We're going to do it in a careful, measured way. We're not driving sales for sales sake. We're going to do it with great gross margin and with a real view to continue to sustain long-term growth.\nScott Roe: And Michael, I think you were asking me in the four quarter, what was FX? It was about 60 bps or so favorable. So, 100 basis points of operational growth in the quarter, and that was really what drove our outperformance versus our expectation. So, those structural drivers are largely in place. As we look at next year, we guided to 40 bps for the full year. We expect to see a little bit stronger in the first half. We got a little bit of freight as a positive in the first half that turns a bit negative in the second half and similar on the FX. So, the important thing to me is the operational benefits that we've seen in gross margin continue and that's really the AUR, AUC that I referenced earlier on an ongoing basis.\nMichael Binetti: Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: And our next question is from Rick Patel of Raymond James.\nRick Patel: Again, congrats on the great progress. For Coach, can you unpack the trends that you're seeing at full price versus outlet? It sounds like you're selling -- you're doing a really good job selling full price product at outlet. So, I'm curious how we should think about the opportunity to lean into that versus what might be a more choiceful consumer shop in that channel.\nTodd Kahn: Sure. Again, we're seeing progress in all our channels. So, when -- and one of the things we're doing, as you noted from the -- from what we're doing with the Tabby bag in outlet is we're blurring the line because the consumer is channel agnostic. They don't see outlet and retail the way we in the industry have historically seen it. When we spend 9% on marketing, a lot of it on upper funnel, particularly focused on families like Tabby, that consumer is walking into our outlet stores and they want the Tabby back. That's their -- that might be their best store in that community that might be -- they maybe a tourist traveling and that's the only visit they make for shopping and they want Tabby. So, we want to meet them where they're at, and of course, we're selling it at full price. So, we're excited by this opportunity. We're doing with Tabby now. We're going to extend it to a number of other brands. In fact, the Brooklyn bag that I mentioned, next month, you'll see it in select outlets as well. So, I think the long-term opportunities of blurring the line providing great value across all our entire fleet. And by the way, we're not just doing this in North America. We've been doing this in China for a while very successfully. So, I see this as the next big unlock for us. And in the coming quarters, we'll talk more and more about it as we get the momentum behind it.\nRick Patel: Thanks very much.\nTodd Kahn: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from Aneesha Sherman of Bernstein.\nAneesha Sherman: You mentioned your capital allocation priorities, and the first one being brand investment. So, as you think about the portfolio of six brands that you hope to have next year, can you talk a little bit about which brands would be priorities for investment, and if they're relevant, geographies, so which brands and which geographies are priorities for brand investment? Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah, we -- I appreciate the question. We evaluate our investment with any capital allocation decision we make with a lot of rigor, understanding the value-creation opportunities we see. And so, you see that in how we've been managing our business at Tapestry, and we would expect to continue to invest in our brands. Our focus is ensuring that we're driving investment behind the brands in marketing. We're being very rigorous on any non-brand-building SG&A. We have and -- we have, I think, competitive advantage through our technology and digital capabilities and we continue to foster those, so that we can meet our customer where they are. And that's globally. Our data and analytics capabilities have been recently rolled out around the world in different regions, so that we have access to the data tools as well. So, those are the places that we invest. And increasingly, we see an opportunity to invest more in our store fleet, which I think you touched on a bit in our capital allocation with two-thirds of the capital we expect to invest in the next fiscal year in brick-and-mortar in expansion and relocation and remodel of our stores. So, we have, as I said, a rigorous process and an understanding of where we see and expect returns from those investments. And geographically, we are -- we definitely see opportunity in Asia, both in China over time, and we're staying close to the consumer there and making sure we understand where our brands need to show up in that region. But also Other Asia and Japan and Korea, like that market is growing in penetration and strong growth there. And we've had success in Europe, as you've seen by our results. So that's not to leave out North America. We continue to find great opportunities to expand the brand. So, I would say that we're investing in brand building first and in distribution, and we'll continue to monitor and deliver, put our money behind the investments that we see driving the best returns for our brands and our business.\nAneesha Sherman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Altschwager of Baird.\nMark Altschwager: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First, just one more on the deal, for Scott. It sounds like expectations for year one accretion have moderated a bit in light of the recent performance at Capri. Could you expand upon some of your underlying assumptions today for year one, the -- on synergized EBITDA, free cash flow and path to the target leverage ratios? And then separately, just regarding the guidance for fiscal '25, guiding to about 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion, it sounds like some leverage in corporate expense embedded in that. As we think about the balance there, any further color as we think about the opportunity at Coach versus Kate? Obviously, Coach, the largest business. So, Q4, we actually saw some margin compression at Coach, first time I think in about seven quarters, while the expansion at Kate was rather significant. So just wondering if there's anything to take away from that as we build-out our model for '25. Thank you.\nScott Roe: Yeah. Let me hit the last part of that real quick because it is a quick one, right? So remember, we had some timing between Q3 and Q4 on expenses, and we said it was related primarily to marketing and it was primarily at Coach. So, there's no news there in Q4 margin. We see a continued path on the -- what I would say, our exceptional margin performance at Coach. And that is not an indication of a trend. It's really just timing between the quarters. And we expect margins at Coach to remain at their exceptional levels and see opportunities to continue to invest and grow gross margins. So, as it relates to the Capri business, you're not wrong. Obviously, as I said and Joanne said in our prepared remarks, we're disappointed and a bit surprised at the flow-through, which all that means is your starting point is a little different and we see execution opportunities that frankly, we know how to get after and that made us reevaluate what that first 12 months looks like. That doesn't really change the destination. And hopefully, you heard that in our collective comments. We still see a very compelling value-creation opportunity. But as we run various scenarios based on where we see the starting point on the current results, we are still confident in accretion, but the exact level of that accretion will be back on closing the deal and give you more granularity there. One other thing too, as it relates to the deal, I said it earlier, but I just want to reiterate because it's important. Don't forget the underlying Tapestry business, which is running a bit ahead of our expectations in profit and cash flow, and also my comments around our increasing conviction around the synergies. So, you got to look at this holistically on the combined entity as you think about the long-term path and the returns. And that collectively is what gave the confidence on the earlier reiteration of the metrics that I laid out in the prepared remarks.\nMark Altschwager: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen.\nOliver Chen: Hi, thank you. I'm curious more broadly on the platform of Tapestry. Kate and Stuart have been works in progress. Just what gives you conviction that, that Kors will work, and any analogies from your experiences improving other brands relative to what you're going to do? And second, on Coach, what's happening with pricing with respect to good, better, best and like-for-like? It sounds like Tabby is incremental in terms of adding that to the outlet assortment? And any thoughts on the health and pricing leverage in China relative to the US? They're both pretty dynamic markets with some macro headwinds as well. Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: So, I'll start with Michael Kors. And what we're seeing in our business and what our platform has been delivering is delivering brand building. And you can see that with Coach and it's a clear example. We have important learnings as we've built the momentum in Coach. Brands win, as you know, Oliver, on emotion and innovation. And as it relates to Michael Kors, we do a lot of outside-in work, including we're doing deep consumer research. And as we've talked to consumers, we've learned that they see Michael Kors as an iconic and distinctive brand. There is a lot of love among consumers for the brand. And what we hear is that the expression of that brand has lost relevance for today's consumer. Under our ownership, we believe we can reinvigorate that through the brand-building efforts and leveraging our platform. It starts with a clear understanding of the target consumer. It's about innovating product and marketing and accelerating growth through direct channels. These are all leveraging the benefits of the Tapestry platform from our consumer insights capabilities to our supply chain to our tech stack. And as we said, we're developing integration process -- developing the integration plans and we have an increasing conviction in the synergy estimates. So, we see a lot of value to unlock and definitely see the opportunity to leverage Tapestry's capabilities to bring that to bear. On the Coach...\nTodd Kahn: As it relates to...\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah, go ahead, Todd.\nTodd Kahn: Sorry. No, thanks. Sorry. Hi, Oliver. In terms of Coach, good-better-best, I think what you've seen us do in the last four years has really raised the floor for us. And we like our positioning. We like the sweet spot of $200 to $500 bags, that range. We have offerings across the spectrum. We have bags for $1,000 and we have opening price point bags. So again, we play in a wide, wide range. We know the consumer has hundreds of choices. We have to win with innovation, which we're doing. You see it with the Tabby extensions. And again, I go back to the New York family. We just launched this Brooklyn bag, and it's incredible. We haven't even started our campaign yet and every week, we're being -- we see our sell-out in different colorways. So, it gives me a lot of good feeling about where we're playing. As it is -- as you reflected China, again, we offer incredible value in China as compared to traditional European luxury. So, I like our brand positioning. We're going to measure -- be measured on AUR growth, particularly in China. We're going to continue to watch the market. And we want to go after and really be the most relevant brand we can be in that market. So, I'm excited by our future and I'm excited by how well we're competing.\nOperator: Thank you.\nChristina Colone: So, I think that is our last question. And I'll turn it over to Joanne for some closing remarks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, Christina, and thank you all for joining us and for your continued interest in our story. As we shared today, we delivered a successful year and are operating from a position of strength. We enter our new fiscal year with a bias for action and growth and will remain maniacally focused on bringing innovation, emotion and execution required to win with consumers. Importantly, our fiscal '25 guidance is both prudent and achievable, and is only a baseline, with additional strategic financial flexibility to enhance our growth and drive significant value for all stakeholders in the months and years to come. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes Tapestry's earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

I'd now like to turn it over to Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry's CEO.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As noted in our press release, our fourth quarter results exceeded expectations, capping a successful year. This is a testament to our passionate global teams whose creativity and exceptional execution continue to fuel our brands and business. They are navigating the current environment with focus and agility, while meaningfully advancing our long-term growth initiatives. Touching on the highlights of the fiscal year. First, we delivered total revenue growth of 1% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the benefits of our globally diversified business model. These top-line results were led by International growth of 6% at constant currency, with gains across key regions, including increases of 14% in Europe, 9% in Other Asia and 5% in Japan, which together represent nearly 20% of Tapestry sales with additional runway for growth. In Greater China, sales rose 3% for the year, as anticipated, which included declines in the second half as we anniversaried last year's strong growth of over 30%. Although the recovery in China has been more gradual than what we originally expected entering fiscal year '24, we continued to invest in our brands, teams and platforms to support our long-term strategic growth agenda in the region and with this important consumer cohort. And in North America, revenue declined 1% compared to last year, while profit rose, driven by gross and operating margin expansion. Second, we remained focused on building new and lasting relationships with consumers by cultivating emotional connections with our brands. During the year, we acquired over 6.5 million new customers in North America alone, of which over half were Gen Z and Millennials, consistent with our strategy to recruit younger consumers to our brands. And we continue to see new customers transact at higher AUR than the balance of our customer base. At the same time, we improved lapsed customer reactivation in North America, which highlights our ability to successfully engage our existing customer base as we drive new customer recruitment. Third, we delivered compelling omnichannel experiences, meeting and delighting our customers wherever they choose to shop. To this end, our global brick and mortar sales rose for the year on a constant currency basis. Importantly, this growth was driven by an increase in productivity across a fleet, which is highly profitable. In addition, we maintained our strong digital positioning with sales more than 3 times pre-pandemic levels, representing nearly 30% of revenue at accretive margins. Our digital business is powered by Tapestry's leading capabilities, which have enabled us to enhance the consumer experience across their purchase journey. Fourth, we fueled fashion innovation and product excellence as we remain focused on bringing the creativity, quality and compelling value required to win with consumers. Nowhere was this more evident than at Coach, where we delivered record annual revenue, including growth in handbags with AUR gains, underscoring the strength of our brand and product offering. Our success is also reflected in our strong gross margin delivery, as we achieved our highest annual gross margin in over 15 years. Overall, we generated record fiscal year earnings per share, which outperformed our expectations, growing at a double-digit pace compared to the prior year, while making strategic investments in our brands and business. Moving forward from this solid foundation, our organization is embracing even greater ambition for the future, reinforcing a culture of innovation and accountability. We are taking action to accelerate growth at Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, while building on the momentum of Coach, positioning us for long-term profitable growth. To this end, we've made two key changes to our executive leadership team. Sandeep Seth, CMO of Coach, has expanded his role to include a newly created position of Chief Growth Officer for Tapestry. Since joining Coach in 2021, he has been instrumental in working alongside Todd Kahn and Stuart Vevers in driving the brand's growth and evolution, including the successful launch of the expressive luxury repositioning. Sandeep will partner with me and our executive leadership team to strengthen the focus on growth across our portfolio, bringing deeper consumer insights into our strategies and building distinctive brand worlds. And earlier this month, we announced the appointment of Eva Erdmann as CEO and Brand President, Kate Spade, effective in October. Eva is a proven brand builder and transformative leader, and I look forward to welcoming her to the organization. Before turning to a discussion of our results in more detail, I'd like to address the pending acquisition of Capri. While we are confident that this combination remains an exceptional strategic fit, there is significant work to do to bring innovation to their brands and reinvigorate their business amid their disappointing decline in standalone results. We believe we're well positioned to execute our integration plans and growth strategies, and that the path to value creation is clear and compelling under our ownership, bringing meaningful benefits to our customers, employees, partners and shareholders around the world. With that, I'll now touch on results and go-forward strategies across each of our brands, starting with Coach. Coach continues to build strength on strength, highlighting the power of expressive luxury. Throughout the year, our teams fueled brand heat and desire, notably with younger consumers, enabling Coach to achieve record annual revenue, which surpassed $5 billion at exceptional margins with significant runway for growth ahead. Now touching on some details of the fourth quarter. With consumer insights at the heart of our work, our talented design and creative teams under Stuart Vevers' leadership once again delivered a range of innovative product offerings that distinguish the brand. To this end, we continued to drive growth in our handbag offering, led by our iconic platforms. The Tabby family delivered another quarter ahead of our expectations, over-indexing with new and younger consumers and nearly doubling versus last year. Quilted Tabby continued to outperform and we further expanded the family with the introduction of the Tabby Backpack. During the quarter, the success of Tabby earned it a coveted spot on the list, ranking third among the 10 hottest products globally and helping to secure Coach's position on the list index for hottest brands, where it was recognized for its unique ability to offer luxury experiences that are inclusive and attainable. Further, given the power and halo of Tabby and consistent with our goal of meeting consumers where they are, we broke the distribution paradigm through a test that brought Tabby 26 to over 100 outlet locations globally, selling at full price, and the test is exceeding our plan. Importantly, the learnings from this test are informing our broader strategies in fiscal '25 and beyond as we explore additional opportunities to scale innovative products and marketing campaigns across channels. Beyond Tabby, our heritage Willow and Rogue families remain foundational volume drivers. We also launched newness with the Juliet shoulder bag, while our viral sensation, The Coach Original Swing Zip continued to resonate strongly with Gen Z customers. Overall, Coach's growth in handbags and accessories outpaced the industry for the year, which included AUR gains globally and in North America, and we see further runway longer term given our innovation pipeline and brand heat. Touching on AUR details for the fourth quarter. Coach's global handbag AUR was even with prior year at constant currency impacted by geographic mix headwinds, while North America handbag AUR growth remained positive. Next, we continued to build out the lifestyle assortment, expanding the brand's reach with consumers with the goal of powering customer recruitment, purchase frequency and ultimately lifetime value. Footwear drove outsized gains driven by the continued success of the low line sneaker as well as the recently launched Brynn Sandal. In ready to wear, we achieved growth with traction in leather jackets, amplifying Coach's positioning as America's original house of leather. And in men's, we animated the League family with the flap, backpack and messenger styles leading with consumers. Turning to marketing, we remained focused on storytelling under the brand's purpose, Courage to be Real. As part of the strategy, this spring we launched the brand's Find Your Courage campaign, featuring Coach ambassadors that inspire consumers to embrace self-expression. By extending our top of funnel activations, we're creating continuous and meaningful conversations with consumers, building emotional connections with the brand and driving cultural relevance. Importantly, as a result of these efforts, we've seen significant gains in unaided awareness, consideration and purchase intent among Gen Z consumers, reinforcing that our strategies are working. Further, we launched unique and immersive retail experiences across the globe, highlighting our commitment to consumer engagement through experiences beyond product. We're also connecting with younger consumers through immersive platforms and virtual experiences in the world of gaming, with a recently debuted collaboration with Roblox and Zepeto in keeping with our goal of innovating in new spaces for the brand. Overall, our holistic brand building activities helped to drive increases in new customer acquisition as we welcomed approximately 4.2 million new customers to Coach this year in North America. This included over 1 million new customers in the fourth quarter, of which approximately 60% were Gen Z and Millennials. At the same time, we've seen significant gains in Google search trends in the US, a clear signal of the brand's momentum. As we enter a new fiscal year, our priorities are clear. We will continue to deepen our connection with consumers, grow leather goods, fuel gains across lifestyle with a focus on footwear, lead with purpose-led storytelling through high impact and sustained brand building campaigns, and expand retail experiences to bring expressive luxury to life through engaging the five senses. These pillars have driven our success and are the right strategies to take us into the future. In closing, Coach is an iconic brand driving modern relevance with brand momentum that is translating into strong financial results. Building on our record year, we are confident in the bright future ahead and our ability to drive healthy sustainable growth as we continue to bring this storied brand to a new generation of consumers. Now moving to Kate Spade. During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategies and reinforce our foundation for the future. While top-line results were challenged, profit once again rose significantly versus prior year, led by continued gross margin expansion and disciplined expense management. Moving forward, we are laser-focused on realizing the full potential of the brand. Importantly, as mentioned, I look forward to welcoming Eva to the organization this fall. She brings a deep understanding of the rapidly evolving consumer landscape and a demonstrated ability to cultivate desire, cultural relevance and passionate communities for distinctive luxury brands. I'm confident that Eva, working alongside the team in place, will enhance our execution to drive sustainable profitable growth. Now touching on our results of the quarter in more detail. First, we remain focused on strengthening the brand's core handbag offering through innovative product and distinctive brand codes. During the quarter, we expanded the Grace family and specialty along with the Phoebe and Spade Flower programs and outlet. These families are resonating with our target consumer and will represent foundational elements of our assortment going forward as our pipeline of newness continues to grow. We also recognize that to successfully drive our product strategies, we need to amplify these efforts through more comprehensive brand building initiatives, including holistic marketing campaigns that build engagement with the brand and its products. Turning to Kate Spade's lifestyle offering, which is a differentiator for the brand. During the quarter, we delivered growth in jewelry, driven by millennial and Gen Z recruitment as well as repeat purchasing and gifting. In addition, in June, we opened the brand's first dedicated jewelry location in London, a test which will provide learnings as we explore the opportunity for growth in the category. Second, we powered the omnichannel experience to drive customer engagement. As you know, in fiscal year '24, we launched a katespadeoutlet.com site, replacing the brand's surprise site and providing a better experience for outlet consumers to discover and shop the brand online. The outlet digital channel grew in the quarter with growth in both new and existing customers at higher margins. Third, we remain focused on creating emotional marketing to fuel brand relevance and heat. During the year, we acquired nearly 2.3 million new customers in North America, including nearly 500,000 new customers during the fourth quarter. Accelerating this progress will be key to our success. To this point, we will continue to distort our investment to top- and mid-funnel marketing to support brand building and growth, particularly with younger audiences, where we are seeing unaided awareness improve with Gen Z consumers. Finally, throughout the year, we maintained a commitment to operational excellence, which underpin the brand's meaningful gross margin and profit expansion. This is structural to our business and an integral part of our go-forward strategy. Turning to our strategic initiatives for fiscal year '25, we have a clear imperative for growth. To achieve this, in the year ahead, we will fuel brand heat to drive consideration and accelerate customer acquisition, strengthen the core handbag foundation, grow lifestyle and maximize the omni channel opportunity. Overall, Kate Spade is a unique and purpose-driven brand with distinctive position in the marketplace and significant expansion opportunities. Its mission of bringing joy to consumers around the world is powerful and we continue to have a relentless drive to deliver sustainable profitable growth. Now turning to Stuart Weitzman. Our results for the year were challenged, significantly impacted by external pressures in the brand's two key markets of North America and Greater China. Despite disappointing financial results, we continued to focus on brand-building initiatives to drive awareness, growth and profitability long term. Touching briefly on our focus areas across product and marketing. During the quarter, we expanded our assortment of sophisticated casual styles, highlighted by momentum in flats. Additionally, we continued to extend the brand's reach through gains in new and emerging categories, including men's and handbags. Importantly, new innovation is driving traction at wholesale with the business growing double-digits at POS in North America in Q4. Further, order bookings through the Spring '25 season are up over 30% to last year. This will support an improvement in revenue and profitability trends in the year ahead. Finally, during the quarter, we remained focused on driving brand relevancy through emotional storytelling in keeping with the brand's ethos of inspiring strength and confidence. Overall, we saw an increase in aided awareness, Google search and social engagement in the US for both the quarter and the year, which represent leading indicators of stronger business results in the future. Looking ahead to fiscal year '25, the Stuart Weitzman team is prioritizing fueling brand relevancy with emotional storytelling, growing their icons and key item platforms while further expanding casual and new categories and accelerating growth in wholesale where there's clear traction. Overall, we see long-term potential for the brand with an empowered team focused on delivering improved top- and bottom-line performance. In closing, Tapestry delivered record full year earnings per share, outperforming expectations and once again demonstrating the power of brand-building, customer-centricity and operational excellence. I want to reiterate my gratitude to our incredible teams globally who continue to drive our success. From this position of strength, we have a bold vision for the future. We know that the landscape is rapidly evolving. Consumers have an incredible amount of choice, and they're exercising those choices every day. We also know that the most successful brands are winning on innovation and emotion. And in this environment, we're well positioned to compete and win. Beyond our organic growth opportunities, there is a clear and compelling path to value creation through the acquisition of Capri, leveraging our platform and leadership to bring meaningful benefits to customers, employees, partners and shareholders around the world. Importantly, we also understand that all great visions require great execution. The year ahead will again require agility and adaptability, controlling the factors we can and managing our business responsibly to drive long-term growth. While we are not immune to macroeconomic and other external factors, we can define our own destiny, given our distinctive brands, talented global teams and strong cash flow. These differentiators provide us with strategic and financial flexibility to continue to deliver enhanced value in fiscal year '25 and for years to come. I'll now turn it over to Scott.\nScott Roe: Thanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Looking back at our results for the fiscal year, our commitment to disciplined growth remains on display. We drove an increase in constant-currency revenue, expanded gross margin 250 basis points while investing in future growth drivers for our brands and business and grew EPS at 11% versus last year to a record earnings per share of $4.29. Now moving to the details of the fourth quarter, beginning with revenue trends on a constant-currency basis. Sales were in line with the prior year and above our guidance for the quarter. These results were led by growth internationally on top of strong double-digit gains from the prior year. By region, Europe grew 26% above last year with strength across channels, including higher spend from local consumers and tourists. In Other Asia, revenue rose 12% with notable growth in Malaysia, Australia and Korea. And in Japan, sales grew 2% with an increase in Chinese consumer spend. In Greater China, revenue declined 10% as anticipated, as we lapped 50% growth a year-ago and continued to navigate a more challenging consumer backdrop in the region. Importantly, and despite these headwinds, we did continue to drive growth in digital channels. In North America, sales declined 1% compared to the prior year, amid a challenging consumer backdrop, while both gross and operating margin rose significantly versus last year as we supported long-term brand health. Now touching on revenue by channel for the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business decreased 2%, amid our overall declines in North America and Greater China, while wholesale grew as expected, increasing 14%. Moving down the P&L, we delivered our strongest fourth quarter gross margin in over 15 years, beating our expectations and expanding 250 basis points versus prior year. This year-over-year expansion was driven by operational outperformance, a benefit of approximately 90 basis points from lower freight expense as well as FX tailwinds. SG&A rose 3%, including the previously disclosed timing shift of $20 million from the third quarter into Q4, which primarily related to marketing. Importantly, we continue to tightly control costs, while making ongoing strategic investments in our brands, people and business platforms. So, taken together, operating margin declined approximately 40 basis points in the quarter. And our fourth quarter EPS of $0.92 exceeded our expectations with roughly half of that beat due to operational upside and half due to a lower tax rate. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the year with $7.2 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $7.2 billion, which reflects the bond financing related to the planned acquisition of Capri of $6.1 billion as well as the early paydown of the company's $450 million term loan in the fiscal fourth quarter. Free cash flow for the year was an inflow of over $1.1 billion, or $1.3 billion excluding deal-related costs. CapEx and implementation costs related to cloud computing for the fiscal year were $144 million. Inventory levels at year-end were 10% below the prior year, reflecting both strong inventory control as well as a shift in receipt timing into our fiscal '25 first quarter. Looking forward, our inventory is well-controlled and current, and we continue to leverage the benefits of our supply chain, navigating the Red Sea disruption with only modest impact. While we expect inventories to be elevated in Q1 due to higher-end transits, the full year is expected to end modestly above prior year levels. Turning to our dividend program. For the fiscal year, we returned $321 million to shareholders through the dividend at an annual rate of $1.40 per share, a 17% increase compared to last year and a dividend payout ratio equal to 39% on a reported basis. Now moving to our guidance for fiscal year '25 on a non-GAAP basis. We've taken a prudent approach to our outlook, balancing the realities of the external environment with the opportunities we see for our business. It's important to note that we view this as our baseline. It does not incorporate any accretion related to the pending acquisition of Capri. For the fiscal year, we expect revenue in the area of $6.7 billion, representing growth compared to the prior year on a reported basis, including approximately 50 basis points of currency pressure. On a constant-currency basis, revenue is expected to increase approximately 1% versus the prior year, consistent with the trend in fiscal year '24. Touching on sales details by region at constant currency. We expect mid-teens growth in Europe and mid-single-digit gains in Other Asia, with North America, Greater China and Japan each planned in the area of prior year. In addition, our outlook assumes operating margin expansion in the area of 50 basis points versus last year. We anticipate gross margin to expand approximately 40 basis points due to operational improvements. Freight is expected to have a negligible impact on gross margin changes in fiscal year '25. On SG&A, we expect expenses to be roughly in line with the prior year, representing slight leverage. Importantly, we're continuing to diligently control costs while investing in our highest impact growth initiatives. For modeling purposes, you can expect corporate expenses to decline versus prior year and drive leverage. Moving to the below the line expectations for the year. Net interest income is expected to be approximately $20 million, which incorporates the fourth quarter paydown of our $450 million term loan and the yield on our growing cash balances with some rate cuts assumed throughout the year. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% and our weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 238 million shares. So taken together, we project EPS of $4.45 to $4.50, representing mid-single-digit growth compared to last year. And bridging versus our fiscal 2025 EPS target previously provided at our Investor Day in 2022, our guidance incorporates a negative impact of $0.35 related to the suspension of share repurchase activity due to the proposed acquisition of Capri, as previously outlined, and an estimated currency headwind of approximately $0.20. Finally, before contemplating any deal-related costs, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, and we expect CapEx and cloud computing costs to be in the area of $190 million. We expect around two-thirds of the spend to be related to store openings, renovations and relocations with the balance primarily related to our ongoing digital and IT investments. Touching on shaping for the year, we expect constant-currency sales to be flat in the first half of the year, with modest growth planned in the back half of the year as we anniversary easier compares in Greater China. In Q1 specifically, we expect constant-currency sales to be down in the area of 2%, due primarily to lower wholesale shipments in North America in the quarter, which is timing for the year as well as mid to high single-digit decline in Greater China. On a reported basis, we expect revenue to be down approximately 3%, including FX headwinds. As mentioned, we expect gross margin expansion for the year, led by the first half with the most significant improvement planned in Q1, benefiting from operational tailwinds. SG&A dollars are expected to be roughly flat with last year in both the first and second halves of the year, including in Q1. We anticipate leverage planned in the back half on the expected growth in revenue. Net interest income is anticipated for the first half with net zero impact planned for the second half, which assumes rate cuts as discussed. Taken together, we expect balanced EPS growth of mid-single-digits for both the first and second halves with Q1 forecasted to approach $0.95. Now to outline our capital allocation priorities looking forward, which are unchanged. First, we will invest in our brands and businesses to support sustainable growth. Second, we will utilize our strong free cash flow for rapid debt repayment. We're committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. To this end, we're confirming our long-term leverage target of less than 2.5 times on a gross debt to adjusted EBITDA basis and expect to achieve that within two years of the Capri transaction close. And finally, we will return capital to shareholders through our dividend. Importantly, we believe our strong cash flow profile provides us with further opportunity for investment and capital return. Following the achievement of our leverage target, over time, we expect to increase our dividend with the goal of achieving our stated target payout ratio of 35% to 40% and see the opportunity to resume share repurchases in the future. Before closing, I'd like to touch on the acquisition of Capri. Since we announced the deal a year ago, the Capri business has been significantly pressured, reporting disappointing results. Having said that, it remains an excellent strategic fit and value creation opportunity. First, we continue to believe these are iconic brands with long-term growth potential. Second, as time has progressed, we've developed growing conviction in the opportunities for synergies, adapting our integration planning and strategies. In addition, over the course of the year, Tapestry's standalone business has outperformed and we expect this to continue. Therefore, in looking at the full picture, the deal remains compelling despite more near-term headwinds than expected. Importantly, we expect EPS accretion on an adjusted basis in year one, enhanced cash flow, compelling ROIC and are firmly committed to achieving our stated leverage target in 24 months post-close. In closing, we delivered a successful year advancing our strategies and building on our track record of operational excellence to drive double-digit EPS gains and strong free cash flow against a dynamic backdrop. Moving forward, we continue to focus on controlling the controllables, remaining agile and committed to driving healthy, sustainable growth and shareholder returns, leveraging the power of our operating model and talented global teams. I'd now like to open it up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities.\nBob Drbul: Hi. Good morning, and congratulations on a strong year at Tapestry. When you look at your results in comparison to Capri's recently, given that underperformance, can you just talk about your commitment to the deal and your thinking? Has it changed around the level of financial returns? I know you spoke to it a bit, Scott, but I was wondering if you guys could expand a little bit more. Thanks.\nScott Roe: Joanne, you're muted.\nOperator: And it does appear that Joanne has disconnected from the call.\nScott Roe: Okay. Let me jump in here, Bob, and just take the second part of your question first. On Capri's standalone results, yeah, you're right, the level of underperformance that they have announced is disappointing and surprising, frankly, particularly as it relates to the flow-through to profitability and cash flow. But this is really an execution opportunity. I hope you see that what we've displayed within our business is agility and the ability to get after expenses and right-size and we see this as a real opportunity. But with that, just notably to pick on the biggest brand or to point out the biggest brand, Michael Kors, despite all these declines in top-line and profitability, it's still a business that has an operating income in the high teens. Second, on the combination, as we said in the prepared remarks, it's still a strong strategic fit. But let me be clear, and financially, the metrics, it is accretive to our baseline EPS, offers double-digit ROIC over our planning horizon, and we're firmly committed to hitting our deleverage targets and maintaining investment-grade even despite the results that have been recently printed. And lastly, as you think about our approach to integration, I mean, I guess one advantage of having this time as we've gone through the FTC process is we've had even more time for integration planning, for doing outside analysis. And based on that, our conviction over the synergies continues to increase. We have even more conviction on what this combination means from a synergy standpoint. So that...\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Hey, Scott?\nScott Roe: Yeah, go ahead.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: I'm sorry about that technical glitch. I am back on the call, so I appreciate it. And to add, Bob, to the points that Scott was making, we do have conviction, but I wanted to touch for a minute on our results because you did mention the contrast in our results versus theirs. So, I think the results we delivered today where I know the results speak to our focus on brand-building, consumer centricity and the excellent execution that our teams are delivering. And I do want to remind you that we delivered the highest gross margin in the company in over 15 years. We delivered double-digit EPS growth and strong free cash flow, and we have momentum at our largest brand, Coach. And as we scan the landscape today, we know that companies and brands that are innovating and executing are winning, and you see that in our results. So that puts us in a position of strength, and it underpins our confidence in the path ahead. And to your question on the acquisition, I know Scott took us through the numbers and how we're thinking about accretion, but this combination remains an excellent strategic fit. And we see compelling long-term value creation opportunity under our ownership. To your point, their standalone results have been surprising and disappointing to us. Our priority is to reinvigorate the business and we believe we're well positioned to do that. These are iconic brands, and to drive growth will bring a stronger focus on the consumer to deliver more innovation and more relevance, and these are areas that we have a proven ability to execute. And as Scott covered the financials, we have a realistic understanding of the financials and confidence in our ability to execute and drive value creation long-term with this transaction.\nBob Drbul: Great. Thank you very much. Good luck with it.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.\nIke Boruchow: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, similar to Bob, just a question around the deal. I guess just, Scott, you kind of alluded to it to Bob's question and on the prepared remarks about synergies. I mean, is it fair to say, we're about a year into this, have you done enough work to believe that there's upside to the synergy target you guys initially guided to should the deal go through? And then, just a quick follow-up would be, what is -- if the deal does not go through, can you just help us understand what is Plan B for you guys in terms of operations, your balance sheet and use of cash? We just kind of love to know how you guys are thinking through the different scenarios. Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Maybe I'll kick it off, Ike, and then pass it to Scott again. We do have both strategic and financial strength and flexibility at Tapestry. We have multiple paths to value creation. Using your words, Plan A is this transaction and the deal is compelling and a significant value creation opportunity for us as I just outlined. But equally important is we entered this transaction from a position of strength. We have a growing organic business, strong earnings delivery and significant cash flow that allows for us to invest in our business and our brands and return capital. So, maybe I'll pass it to Scott to add any details on our capital allocation priorities.\nScott Roe: Yeah, sure. So, while Plan A is our priority, should we find ourselves in the Plan B scenario, a couple of things I'd just remind you of Ike. So first of all, our free cash flow strength, and if you look over the year just reported and our guidance for this year kind of averaging in that $1.2 billion from free cash flow, think of that as an ongoing baseline for the underlying profitability of the business, a little over $300 million in dividends, $325 million. That gives us more than $800 million of excess cash, which can be deployed against those capital allocation priorities. And should we find ourselves in that situation and given the current valuation, obviously, buybacks are a pretty compelling option for us to consider in that four-lens framework. The other question you asked me was synergies. I'm not prepared to give you a number. I would just reiterate what I said that more than $200 million, we have even more conviction. So, you can assume that means that we're looking at potentially even more synergies from this deal. Upon closing, we'll come back and give you more illumination on what that looks like.\nIke Boruchow: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Boss of JPMorgan.\nMatt Boss: Great. Thanks. So, Joanne, could you elaborate on current health of the Coach brand in North America? Maybe any changes in customer behavior in the category that you've seen so far in the first quarter? And just how current trends have shaped your view for 2025 in the region? And then quickly for Scott, on gross margin, I guess, how best to think about AUR opportunity or any change in the promotional landscape that you've embedded in your 2025 plan?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Hey, Matt. I'll touch on the consumer, but then toss it to Todd maybe for a few comments on Coach. We couldn't be more confident and excited about the positioning of Coach, but I won't steal Todd's thunder. As we look at the consumer, we're seeing consistency from what we've seen really in the last few quarters, and that's a consumer that's choiceful. What we see in the market is that innovation and emotion continue to win and that puts heightened importance on brand execution and brand heat, where we're meeting the high bar -- that customers' high bar for innovation, we're winning. We talked about the consumer acquisition in the quarter, 1.6 million customers, in the year, 6.5 million new customers to the brand. And we continue to invest in brand building and innovation to ensure we're cutting through with consumers and winning. Where we're doing that, we're seeing the consumer respond. We see it across channels and across income cohorts. So, a continuation really of what we've been seeing, particularly in North America. But Todd, do you want to touch on Coach?\nTodd Kahn: Yeah, thanks. First, in North America, Coach delivered slight growth in the fourth quarter, and it was -- at incredible margins, and it was led by our retail full price business. When you scale out for a second, there are very, very few brands that are at our level of volume that are growing, that deliver 76%-plus gross margin, and just to refresh your recollection, that's 600 basis points above FY '19. And when you get to the reasons why, we can do that because of four overarching attributes. First, expressive luxury is working with our myopic focus on timeless Gen Z. Second, product innovation. Product innovation is just incredible. You see it with Tabby. You may have noticed a recent bag we launched called Brooklyn. Brooklyn is part of the New York family. It is -- has a very different attitude than Tabby, and it's incremental. And around the shop, we like to say no sleep till Brooklyn, New York becomes the next Tabby family. And lastly, the compelling storytelling in our marketing coupled with what really is our underlying strength. We have a team of operators who know how to be commercially successful. And that bodes well for Coach's future, but it also bodes well for the bench we're creating for Tapestry's future.\nScott Roe: And a very brief add to your specific question as it relates to what's driving gross margin, it's really the structural drivers that you saw on display in the year just closed, continue into next year. Yeah, AUR is a part of that. Also AUC as we continue to find efficiencies throughout the supply chain and that's probably an underappreciated part of our gross margin story as we think about structural advantages going forward.\nMatt Boss: Great. Best of luck.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. I wanted to touch on Kate Spade for a minute. You spoke of a need to amplify the efforts there through holistic marketing campaigns. Does this imply a need for further investment to fuel a turnaround, or do you think you can continue the margin progress as you turn sales?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Good morning, Lorraine. We expect to build on the foundation that we've set over the last few years and our focus is really to accelerate the growth in the top-line. As we said in our prepared remarks, Kate is a unique brand. It has a distinctive positioning in the marketplace. And the opportunities we see to expand the top-line are very clear. We have a clear imperative for growth from here through brand building. And as we talked about, it's not just about bringing the innovation, which is required for -- from consumers today, we have to bring the innovation, but we also have to cut through with holistic marketing and brand building. We are investing in the brand. So, even as we're delivering higher gross margins, operating margins and profit dollars, which we did in fiscal '24, we're doing that while investing in the brand. So, you'll see us continue to invest in the brand, but also continue to expand margins as we work to improve the top-line performance of the brand. And we look forward to welcoming Eva in October.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning, and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping we could touch on China. Can you elaborate on the health of your brands in the China marketplace? What you're seeing in the quarter-to-date period? And perhaps outline the most important drivers of a return to growth within your outlook into the second half?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, we are building and continue to drive a healthy business. That's been our focus not only in China, but around the world and I think evidenced in our margin delivery that continues at Tapestry, but like many others, we're seeing macro headwinds impacting the landscape. Despite this, we did grow in fiscal '24. And as we think about the forward view, we are expecting the market to be basically in line in fiscal '25 with where it was in '24. But we -- our long-term view on China and the opportunity that exists in that market has not changed. We're taking a prudent approach in the short term in how we're planning and in our guidance, but we continue to stay close to the consumer. Our teams are moving as that consumer is moving. We're building the business in a very healthy way in the market. And maybe I'll toss it to Todd to give some color around what we're seeing at Coach specifically.\nTodd Kahn: Thank you, Joanne, and good morning, Brooke. Building on what Joanne said, we are very, very bullish on the mid- and long-term view on China. And we still see that as our best opportunity by region for meaningful growth. And what I particularly like is where the Coach brand is positioned. As we've seen traditional European luxury soften in China, our relevancy, we're getting -- we're giving that consumer an incredible value at a very fashionable -- with a very fashionable product. I'd say sometimes we don't need China to create 10 million millionaires. We need China to provide us with 10 million people that can buy a $500 bag. That's a materially different space. And we're -- so I see over the coming years, productivity gains, and I also see real opportunities for distribution gains in second- and third-tier cities where again we show up so well. We're very relevant to the consumer. We're very focused on their desire. So, I'm very, very bullish on China over the long term.\nBrooke Roach: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Binetti of Evercore ISI.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Just a quick one on AUR and another question. Just you said flat in the quarter, but it was largely geography mix. Maybe where you're seeing the pressure? How durable you think those pressures are? And if there's a path to AUR being up in totality in '25? And then, on the gross margin, just to unpack it a little bit more, nice increase in fourth quarter. I think you said of the 250 basis points, 90 basis points was freight. Maybe how much of it was FX? And then, what goes away as we roll into fourth quarter, what comes back? And you said the first quarter will be -- will expand the most from I think, Scott, you said operational tailwinds. Maybe just double-click on that and where you see the opportunity from here for the Coach brand multi-year, given the record levels?\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Well, I'll start at a high level, but briefly. What supports AUR, excuse me, is the innovation and the investments we're making in brand building. And we see that today and where we're delivering that innovation, we're winning and our brand building efforts are paying off. We're acquiring new customers and younger customers importantly. And those customers are coming into our brands and at higher AUR and strong margins. So, those investments that we're making are paying off. The work that we do is structural to our business and I'm staying close to the consumer leveraging data, but it's that balance of magic and logic that we continue to bring. That's structural. And that's what gives us confidence in the future for both gross margin and AUR. But Todd, I don't know if you want to make some comments about Coach specifically.\nTodd Kahn: Yeah. You touched on so many important things, but I understand when you look at it and we love celebrating that we had the highest sales in our history and exceeded $5 billion. And 11 years ago was the last time we exceeded $5 billion or just touched on it. We're doing it in such a brand healthy way today. You see it in our gross margin. You see it in our commitment under our, what we call, Coach-genomics to put our -- that gross margin to work, reducing our non-marketing SG&A and putting it in marketing to do exactly what Joanne just said, bring in a relevant younger new customer who experiences the brand at -- with a lot of brand heat and a lot of elevation. So, I see our path forward to be really robust. We're going to do it in a careful, measured way. We're not driving sales for sales sake. We're going to do it with great gross margin and with a real view to continue to sustain long-term growth.\nScott Roe: And Michael, I think you were asking me in the four quarter, what was FX? It was about 60 bps or so favorable. So, 100 basis points of operational growth in the quarter, and that was really what drove our outperformance versus our expectation. So, those structural drivers are largely in place. As we look at next year, we guided to 40 bps for the full year. We expect to see a little bit stronger in the first half. We got a little bit of freight as a positive in the first half that turns a bit negative in the second half and similar on the FX. So, the important thing to me is the operational benefits that we've seen in gross margin continue and that's really the AUR, AUC that I referenced earlier on an ongoing basis.\nMichael Binetti: Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: And our next question is from Rick Patel of Raymond James.\nRick Patel: Again, congrats on the great progress. For Coach, can you unpack the trends that you're seeing at full price versus outlet? It sounds like you're selling -- you're doing a really good job selling full price product at outlet. So, I'm curious how we should think about the opportunity to lean into that versus what might be a more choiceful consumer shop in that channel.\nTodd Kahn: Sure. Again, we're seeing progress in all our channels. So, when -- and one of the things we're doing, as you noted from the -- from what we're doing with the Tabby bag in outlet is we're blurring the line because the consumer is channel agnostic. They don't see outlet and retail the way we in the industry have historically seen it. When we spend 9% on marketing, a lot of it on upper funnel, particularly focused on families like Tabby, that consumer is walking into our outlet stores and they want the Tabby back. That's their -- that might be their best store in that community that might be -- they maybe a tourist traveling and that's the only visit they make for shopping and they want Tabby. So, we want to meet them where they're at, and of course, we're selling it at full price. So, we're excited by this opportunity. We're doing with Tabby now. We're going to extend it to a number of other brands. In fact, the Brooklyn bag that I mentioned, next month, you'll see it in select outlets as well. So, I think the long-term opportunities of blurring the line providing great value across all our entire fleet. And by the way, we're not just doing this in North America. We've been doing this in China for a while very successfully. So, I see this as the next big unlock for us. And in the coming quarters, we'll talk more and more about it as we get the momentum behind it.\nRick Patel: Thanks very much.\nTodd Kahn: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from Aneesha Sherman of Bernstein.\nAneesha Sherman: You mentioned your capital allocation priorities, and the first one being brand investment. So, as you think about the portfolio of six brands that you hope to have next year, can you talk a little bit about which brands would be priorities for investment, and if they're relevant, geographies, so which brands and which geographies are priorities for brand investment? Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah, we -- I appreciate the question. We evaluate our investment with any capital allocation decision we make with a lot of rigor, understanding the value-creation opportunities we see. And so, you see that in how we've been managing our business at Tapestry, and we would expect to continue to invest in our brands. Our focus is ensuring that we're driving investment behind the brands in marketing. We're being very rigorous on any non-brand-building SG&A. We have and -- we have, I think, competitive advantage through our technology and digital capabilities and we continue to foster those, so that we can meet our customer where they are. And that's globally. Our data and analytics capabilities have been recently rolled out around the world in different regions, so that we have access to the data tools as well. So, those are the places that we invest. And increasingly, we see an opportunity to invest more in our store fleet, which I think you touched on a bit in our capital allocation with two-thirds of the capital we expect to invest in the next fiscal year in brick-and-mortar in expansion and relocation and remodel of our stores. So, we have, as I said, a rigorous process and an understanding of where we see and expect returns from those investments. And geographically, we are -- we definitely see opportunity in Asia, both in China over time, and we're staying close to the consumer there and making sure we understand where our brands need to show up in that region. But also Other Asia and Japan and Korea, like that market is growing in penetration and strong growth there. And we've had success in Europe, as you've seen by our results. So that's not to leave out North America. We continue to find great opportunities to expand the brand. So, I would say that we're investing in brand building first and in distribution, and we'll continue to monitor and deliver, put our money behind the investments that we see driving the best returns for our brands and our business.\nAneesha Sherman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Altschwager of Baird.\nMark Altschwager: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First, just one more on the deal, for Scott. It sounds like expectations for year one accretion have moderated a bit in light of the recent performance at Capri. Could you expand upon some of your underlying assumptions today for year one, the -- on synergized EBITDA, free cash flow and path to the target leverage ratios? And then separately, just regarding the guidance for fiscal '25, guiding to about 50 bps of EBIT margin expansion, it sounds like some leverage in corporate expense embedded in that. As we think about the balance there, any further color as we think about the opportunity at Coach versus Kate? Obviously, Coach, the largest business. So, Q4, we actually saw some margin compression at Coach, first time I think in about seven quarters, while the expansion at Kate was rather significant. So just wondering if there's anything to take away from that as we build-out our model for '25. Thank you.\nScott Roe: Yeah. Let me hit the last part of that real quick because it is a quick one, right? So remember, we had some timing between Q3 and Q4 on expenses, and we said it was related primarily to marketing and it was primarily at Coach. So, there's no news there in Q4 margin. We see a continued path on the -- what I would say, our exceptional margin performance at Coach. And that is not an indication of a trend. It's really just timing between the quarters. And we expect margins at Coach to remain at their exceptional levels and see opportunities to continue to invest and grow gross margins. So, as it relates to the Capri business, you're not wrong. Obviously, as I said and Joanne said in our prepared remarks, we're disappointed and a bit surprised at the flow-through, which all that means is your starting point is a little different and we see execution opportunities that frankly, we know how to get after and that made us reevaluate what that first 12 months looks like. That doesn't really change the destination. And hopefully, you heard that in our collective comments. We still see a very compelling value-creation opportunity. But as we run various scenarios based on where we see the starting point on the current results, we are still confident in accretion, but the exact level of that accretion will be back on closing the deal and give you more granularity there. One other thing too, as it relates to the deal, I said it earlier, but I just want to reiterate because it's important. Don't forget the underlying Tapestry business, which is running a bit ahead of our expectations in profit and cash flow, and also my comments around our increasing conviction around the synergies. So, you got to look at this holistically on the combined entity as you think about the long-term path and the returns. And that collectively is what gave the confidence on the earlier reiteration of the metrics that I laid out in the prepared remarks.\nMark Altschwager: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen.\nOliver Chen: Hi, thank you. I'm curious more broadly on the platform of Tapestry. Kate and Stuart have been works in progress. Just what gives you conviction that, that Kors will work, and any analogies from your experiences improving other brands relative to what you're going to do? And second, on Coach, what's happening with pricing with respect to good, better, best and like-for-like? It sounds like Tabby is incremental in terms of adding that to the outlet assortment? And any thoughts on the health and pricing leverage in China relative to the US? They're both pretty dynamic markets with some macro headwinds as well. Thank you.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: So, I'll start with Michael Kors. And what we're seeing in our business and what our platform has been delivering is delivering brand building. And you can see that with Coach and it's a clear example. We have important learnings as we've built the momentum in Coach. Brands win, as you know, Oliver, on emotion and innovation. And as it relates to Michael Kors, we do a lot of outside-in work, including we're doing deep consumer research. And as we've talked to consumers, we've learned that they see Michael Kors as an iconic and distinctive brand. There is a lot of love among consumers for the brand. And what we hear is that the expression of that brand has lost relevance for today's consumer. Under our ownership, we believe we can reinvigorate that through the brand-building efforts and leveraging our platform. It starts with a clear understanding of the target consumer. It's about innovating product and marketing and accelerating growth through direct channels. These are all leveraging the benefits of the Tapestry platform from our consumer insights capabilities to our supply chain to our tech stack. And as we said, we're developing integration process -- developing the integration plans and we have an increasing conviction in the synergy estimates. So, we see a lot of value to unlock and definitely see the opportunity to leverage Tapestry's capabilities to bring that to bear. On the Coach...\nTodd Kahn: As it relates to...\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Yeah, go ahead, Todd.\nTodd Kahn: Sorry. No, thanks. Sorry. Hi, Oliver. In terms of Coach, good-better-best, I think what you've seen us do in the last four years has really raised the floor for us. And we like our positioning. We like the sweet spot of $200 to $500 bags, that range. We have offerings across the spectrum. We have bags for $1,000 and we have opening price point bags. So again, we play in a wide, wide range. We know the consumer has hundreds of choices. We have to win with innovation, which we're doing. You see it with the Tabby extensions. And again, I go back to the New York family. We just launched this Brooklyn bag, and it's incredible. We haven't even started our campaign yet and every week, we're being -- we see our sell-out in different colorways. So, it gives me a lot of good feeling about where we're playing. As it is -- as you reflected China, again, we offer incredible value in China as compared to traditional European luxury. So, I like our brand positioning. We're going to measure -- be measured on AUR growth, particularly in China. We're going to continue to watch the market. And we want to go after and really be the most relevant brand we can be in that market. So, I'm excited by our future and I'm excited by how well we're competing.\nOperator: Thank you.\nChristina Colone: So, I think that is our last question. And I'll turn it over to Joanne for some closing remarks.\nJoanne Crevoiserat: Thanks, Christina, and thank you all for joining us and for your continued interest in our story. As we shared today, we delivered a successful year and are operating from a position of strength. We enter our new fiscal year with a bias for action and growth and will remain maniacally focused on bringing innovation, emotion and execution required to win with consumers. Importantly, our fiscal '25 guidance is both prudent and achievable, and is only a baseline, with additional strategic financial flexibility to enhance our growth and drive significant value for all stakeholders in the months and years to come. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes Tapestry's earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation.",
