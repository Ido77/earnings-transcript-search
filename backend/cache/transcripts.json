    "fullTranscript": "Suhasini Chandramouli: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of tariffs and other trade measures and macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Additional information will also be in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 29, 2025 to be filed tomorrow and in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, we are reporting 95.4 billion in revenue, up 5% from a year ago and at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter record. Services achieved an all-time revenue record, growing 12% compared to the prior year. We also set a number of quarterly records in countries and regions across the world, including the UK, Spain, Finland, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, Poland, India, and the Philippines. We are as dedicated as ever to the innovation and ingenuity that will enrich our customers' lives and help us leave the world better than we found it. And we are proud to increase our impact around the world, including here in the United States, where we recently announced plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years. We're going to be expanding our teams in our facilities in several states, including Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. And we're going to be opening a new factory for advanced server manufacturing in Texas. During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year. We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company. All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the U.S. across all 50 states. Now I'll turn to products, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago. During the quarter, we introduced iPhone 16e, a great new entry-level addition to our iPhone 16 lineup. It's powered by our latest generation A18 chip and includes the all-new Apple-designed C1 modem, the most energy-efficient modem ever in an iPhone, allowing iPhone 16e to have the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone. Meanwhile, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus users are exploring how they can use Camera Control, whether capturing stunning images or exploring the world with Visual Intelligence. And our iPhone 16 Pro models continue to be a hit with our users. They are turbocharged by the remarkable capabilities and efficiency of A18 Pro and feature larger displays, an advanced camera system and a beautiful design. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, 7% higher year-over-year, another great quarter for Mac. During the quarter, we introduced significant new updates to our lineup. The world's most popular laptop just got even better. The M4-powered MacBook Air features a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera and delivers a massive boost in performance. And now it comes in a beautiful new sky blue color. The new Mac Studio is the most powerful Mac we've ever shipped, equipped with M4 Max and our new M3 Ultra chip. It's a true AI powerhouse capable of running large language models with over 600 billion parameters entirely in memory. Apple Intelligence brings great capabilities to the Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and get more done. Turning to iPad. Revenue for the quarter was $6.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago, another strong quarter of double digit growth. Our iPad lineup continues to help users learn, work, play, and go wherever their imaginations take them. The new iPad Air with M3 combines powerful performance and exceptional portability, whether you're taking it across the street or around the world. And Apple Intelligence and Apple Pencil Pro are a perfect match, with features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions, and Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% from a year ago. From walking trails to bike paths, Apple Watch Series 10 is an essential partner wherever you are on the health and fitness journey. And AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation delivers an extraordinary experience in an open-ear design. Customers continue to tell me how important our Hearing Health features for AirPods Pro 2 are to them, and we've been expanding their availability to reach even more users around the world. Millions have already taken hearing tests and the stories we received about the new hearing aid feature are deeply moving, showing how these innovations are making a real difference in people's daily lives. It's a powerful reminder of the impact technology can have when it's designed with care. Meanwhile, Apple Vision Pro takes the concert experience to a whole new level with Metallica, our latest Apple immersive video, which you have to see to believe. And visionOS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users while inviting them to explore a curated and regularly updated collection of spatial experiences with the Spatial Gallery app. In retail, in addition to the two stores we opened during the quarter, we're also looking forward to a new retail store in the UAE, the arrival of the online store in Saudi Arabia and new retail stores in India starting later this year. Let's now turn to Services, where we achieved an all-time revenue record of $26.6 billion, up 12% from a year ago with strong performance across all of our categories. From starting their morning with their podcast of choice to buying a coffee with Apple Pay to spending an afternoon reading the latest bestseller on Apple Books to using their favorite app from the App Store or an evening workout with Fitness+, Apple Services are enriching our users' lives all throughout their day. With incredible shows like The Studio, Your Friends & Neighbors and the culture-shaping Severance, Apple TV+ has become a must-see destination with record viewership during the quarter. And we're excited for our upcoming movie F1 starring Brad Pitt, which will hit theaters this summer and gives an incredible inside look at one of the most intense sports on Earth. And there is so much more to come this year. It's no wonder Apple TV+ has earned more than 2,500 award nominations and 560 wins. We're also reaching sports fans in more ways than ever, from watching our favorite teams go to bat on Friday Night Baseball to cheering on their local team with MLS Season Pass to following the results of every Grand Prix with Formula 1 now on the Apple Sports app. Turning to software. We just released iOS 18.4, which brought Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese as well as localized English to Singapore and India. AI and machine learning are core to so many profound features we've rolled out over the years to help our users live a better day. It's why we designed Apple Silicon with a neural engine that powers so many AI features across our products and third-party apps. It's also what makes Apple products the best devices for generative AI. At WWDC 24, we announced Apple Intelligence and shared our vision for integrating generative AI across our ecosystem into the apps and features our users rely on every day. To achieve this goal, we built our own highly capable foundation models that are specialized for everyday tasks. We designed helpful features that are right where our users need them and are easy to use. And we went to great lengths to build a system that protects user privacy, whether requests are processed on-device or in the cloud with Private Cloud Compute, an extraordinary step forward for privacy and AI. Since we launched iOS 18, we've released a number of Apple Intelligence features from helpful Writing Tools to Genmoji, Image Playground, Image Wand, Clean Up, Visual Intelligence and a seamless connection to ChatGPT, we made it possible for users to create movies of their memories with a simple prompt and added AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, summaries for mail, messages and more. We've also expanded these capabilities to more languages and regions. With regard to the more personal Siri features we announced, we need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high-quality bar. We are making progress and we look forward to getting these features into customers' hands. Turning to sustainability. We just celebrated Earth Day, and we were proud to announce that we've cut our emissions by 60% from our 2015 levels. Today, we're using more clean energy across our operations and more recycled materials in our products than ever. We have worked with suppliers to bring 17.8 gigawatts of renewable electricity online. We're also saving billions of gallons of freshwater and redirecting millions of metric tons of waste from landfills. All of this will help us make important progress towards our goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the life cycle of our products by 2030. Now let me walk you through the impacts of tariffs in the March quarter and give you some color on what we expect for the June quarter. For the March quarter, we had a limited impact from tariffs as we were able to optimize our supply chain and inventory. For the June quarter, currently, we are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter. However, for some color, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter. For our part, we will manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to innovation and the possibilities it creates. As we look ahead, we remain confident, confident that we will continue to build the world's best products and services, confident in our ability to innovate and enrich our users' lives, and confident that we can continue to run our business in a way that has always set Apple apart. Next month, we can't wait to welcome our developer community for the Worldwide Developers Conference, and we look forward to revealing some exciting announcements. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.\nKevan Parekh: Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter revenue of $95.4 billion was up 5% year-over-year despite a headwind of almost 2.5 percentage points from foreign exchange. We also grew in the majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $68.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year despite over 2 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds. And as Tim mentioned, this was an all-time revenue record. We also grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 47.1%, in the middle of our guidance range and up 20 basis points sequentially primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 35.9%, down 340 basis points sequentially, driven by mix, foreign exchange and a seasonal loss of leverage. Services gross margin was 75.7%, up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a different mix, partly offset by foreign exchange. Operating expenses landed at $15.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was $24.8 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter record. Operating cash flow was also strong at $24 billion. Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% year- over-year driven by the iPhone 16 family. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total and in every geographic segment, and iPhone upgraders grew double-digits year-over-year. According to a recent survey from Kantar, during the March quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. And we continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 97% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year, driven by the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini models. This performance was broad-based with every geographic segment growing year-over-year. Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw strong growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Customer satisfaction was reported at 95% in the U.S. iPad revenue was $6.4 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new M3-powered iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Keep in mind, we did face a more difficult compare against the launch of the Apple Vision Pro in the year ago quarter as well as the Watch Ultra 2 launched last year. At the same time, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And customer satisfaction for Watch in the U.S. was recently measured at 95%. Our Services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year. This growth rate was comparable to the December quarter year-over-year growth rate when we removed the negative impact from foreign exchange. We saw strong momentum in the March quarter and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our Services offerings also continue to grow. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our service offerings from additional features in News+ to new games available on Arcade. Apple Pay continues to help our customers with an easy, secure and private payment solution, and we were pleased to see that our active users in Apple Pay reached an all-time record, up double-digits year-over-year. Turning to enterprise. Organizations are investing more on Apple products and services to drive productivity and employee engagement. For example, KPMG recently rolled out iPhone 16 for all U.S. employees, reflecting their confidence in Apple's security and privacy features. We also continue to see strong Mac performance in enterprise. New Bank, the largest digital bank in Latin America has selected MacBook Air as a standard computer for their thousands of employees. With Vision Pro, companies are continuing to find new and innovative ways to leverage this technology. Dassault Systèmes, a leading provider for engineering and 3D design software has natively integrated Apple Vision Pro into their next-generation platform, bringing a powerful and immersive spatial experience to thousands of enterprise customers. Now let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $3 billion in debt maturities and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $98 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $35 billion. During the quarter, we returned $29 billion to shareholders. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 108 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today, our Board authorized an additional $100 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.26 per share of common stock, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we have done for the last 13 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2025. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call. And the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today for the current quarter. Despite the overall uncertain environment, we will still be providing color at the total company level, subject to these assumptions and the risk factors that we referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, which includes the estimated impact of the $900 million of tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: Great, thanks so much guys for taking my questions. Tim, I'd love to maybe touch on the tariff point first. There were comments from you earlier on CNBC talking about 50% of iPhones for the U.S. currently coming from India. Where do you expect the mix of India-sourced iPhones for the U.S. to be by the end of your fiscal year? And is it the goal to source 100% of your U.S.-bound iPhones from India? Can you just help us understand kind of how we should expect that to trend as we look beyond just the June quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, Erik, hi. It's Tim. The existing tariffs that apply to Apple today are based on the product's country of origin as you alluded to. For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the -- also sold in the U.S. China would continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of total product sales outside the U.S. And so if you look at the categories of tariffs that are applicable to us today, for the June quarter, most of our tariff exposure relates to the February IEEPA-related tariff at the rate of 20%, which applies to imports to the U.S. for products that have China as their country of origin. In addition, for China, there was an additional 125% tariff for imports of certain categories of products announced in April. And for us, that's some of our U.S. AppleCare and Accessories businesses and brings the total rate in China for these products to at least 145%. Also for transparency and clarity, the vast majority of our products, including iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Vision Pro, are currently not subject to the global reciprocal tariffs that were announced in April as the Commerce Department has initiated a Section 232 investigation into imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and downstream products that contain semiconductors. And so if you -- for the June quarter, as I talked about in the -- in my opening comments, we estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff, rates, policies and applications don't change for the balance of the quarter, to be 900 million to our costs. I wouldn't want to predict the mix of production in the future, but I wanted to give you clarity for the June quarter of where the country of origins are so you can use that for your modeling.\nErik Woodring: Okay. I appreciate that color. Thank, Tim. And then maybe my follow-up is there were a number of reports during the quarter that Apple had pulled forward sell-in into the channel to get ahead of tariffs. So can you just help us better kind of understand or clarify if sell-in and sell-through were aligned in the March quarter? If you're assuming that they would be aligned in the June quarter guide? And ultimately, do you believe that consumers are accelerating hardware purchases to get ahead of any potential pricing increases or was behavior normal? Thank you so much, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes. Thanks, Erik, for the question. There are several questions there. One, in terms of the pull forward in demand, if you look at the March quarter, we don't believe that we saw obvious evidence of a significant pull forward in demand in the March quarter due to tariffs. If you look at our channel inventory, from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, the unit channel inventory was similar, not only for iPhone but for the balance of our products. Again, for transparency, you will see that we did build ahead inventory, and that's reflected in our manufacturing purchase obligations that you'll see on the quarterly filing when it comes out. So I hope that makes the -- answers all your questions.\nErik Woodring: Thank you so much, Tim. Good Luck.\nTim Cook: Thanks.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Eric. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hi, thanks a lot. Tim, if you had told me that on April 2 that your hit from tariffs was only a nickel-ish a quarter at 900 million, that would have been a pretty good outcome, given the panic that ensued. I'm surprised that it's that low. But then you did make a comment about after the June quarter, and sorry to push you on that, but could it be a multiple of that figure or is it just completely unknown? We're all just trying to figure out what happens after June. And if there's just any guidance you guys can possibly give that it's bigger, smaller or what? And hoping you can just give us a little color on that. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yes, Ben. Thanks for the question. I tried to give you some information in the previous question about the country of origin, which currently is the key factor in determining the tariffs that we're paying. I don't want to predict the future because I'm not sure what will happen with the tariffs, and there is the Section 232 investigation going on. And so it's very difficult to predict beyond June. And June has the assumptions in it that I had mentioned earlier.\nBen Reitzes: All right, Tim. And then just with regard to China down 2%, I mean, you intuitively would have thought there would have been an increased nationalism there and perhaps it would have been worse than that. And the trajectory there improving even with subsidies because subsidies benefited your competitors, too. Just wondering if I could get a little more color there. Can it keep improving? What are you thinking with regard to that trajectory in China, given all the geopolitical tensions? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yes, we were down 2%, as you point out, for the March quarter. And to provide a little more transparency around that, we were roughly flat when you remove the headwinds from foreign exchange. And so we did see quite a bit of sequential improvement from the December quarter, which was down 11. And again, for going out of the way for transparency, the channel inventory at the end of March, the unit channel inventory was similar to where we started the quarter. So there wasn't a build of channel inventory in there. I do believe that the subsidies played a favorable impact on the results. It's difficult to estimate with precision as to exactly how much, but I think it was positive. Some of our products are included. Some of them are not. Generally, on iPhone, if something is priced above RMB6,000, it is not eligible for the subsidy and the other products have different rules. But I do think it helped. And I think it's helping others as well, I'm sure. iPhone was the key driver of the improvement sequentially. And so hopefully, that provides you some color. The other thing I would say is that the Mac, the iPad, and the Watch are attracting a majority of customers new to that product. And so that continues to look quite good in China. And iPhone was the top two models in urban China, and iPad was the top two tablets in urban China. So there's some positive nuggets there.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes. Thank you, Ben.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your responses on some of this trade policy uncertainty. I appreciated the transparency around building ahead with inventory. Will you continue to do that in this interim period until we get some clarity on Section 232 investigation? And could you talk a little bit about your philosophy on pricing, elevated costs to the extent that comes through, whether that be to resellers or end consumers and other efficiency efforts that you might be able to pursue? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. Obviously, we're very engaged on the tariff discussions. We believe in engagement and we'll continue to engage. On the pricing piece, we have nothing to announce today. And I'll just say that the operational team has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain and the inventory. And we'll obviously continue to do those things to the degree that we can.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up for Kevan, on product gross margins, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the factors that may have impacted product gross margins in the quarter. Obviously, down sequentially on seasonal factors but there was a year-over-year decline as well. So any additional color would be helpful? Thank you.\nKevan Parekh: Yes, Michael, thanks. This is Kevan. So on the sequential, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had a decrease in the product gross margin by 340 basis points sequentially. That was primarily driven by mix, seasonal loss of leverage, foreign exchange and that was partly offset by cost savings. And when we look at the year-on-year performance, we were down 70 basis points on a year-on- year basis. And that was driven by a different mix and foreign exchange.\nMichael Ng: Thank you.\nKevan Parekh: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. I guess I'll have to start with a tariff question as well. Tim, I think when you talked about the 900 million impact to your cost of goods sold, you sort of had a statement that there are certain unique factors that benefit you in the June quarter related to that number. Can you just talk about what are these unique factors that are benefiting you in the June quarter? And what would the impact be without those benefits essentially?\nTim Cook: I wouldn't want to go through all of them. But as an example, the build ahead that is -- I mentioned earlier that's in the manufacturing purchase obligations is -- were helpful.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then as I think about the June quarter guide of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, I was wondering, do you folks expect services growth to remain in the double-digit range as you go into the back half of the year? I imagine FX is a bit of a benefit as you go to the back half. I would love to just understand, within that framework, how do you think services stacks up as you go through the June quarter?\nKevan Parekh: Yes, Amit. Hi, it's Kevan. So I think when we talk about the overall June quarter, we talk about the low to mid-single digits year- over-year. We do expect foreign exchange in the June quarter to improve sequentially. However, we are expecting it to be a slight headwind to revenue on a year-on-year basis. With respect to services, given the uncertainty we see from several factors, we aren't providing the category level of color today.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. Thank you.\nKevan Parekh: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Tim or Kevan, how should investors think about the gross margin trajectory as you source more from the U.S. in particular or other supply chain changes that you are making, including in India? How should those kind of play into the cost structure and how should we think about that gross margin trajectory and I will follow-up?\nTim Cook: We're excited about bringing more production to the U.S. As you know, we've been very key in the TSMC project in Arizona and are the largest and first customer getting product out of that. And that's the SoC that's coming out of there. We also have glass coming out of the U.S. and the Face ID module and loads of chips. In fact, there's 19 billion chips coming out across 12 states. This is down to the resistor and capacitor level, obviously. And so there's some that is already built into the margins that Kevan has quoted. And we don't really forecast beyond the current quarter as you know.\nKevan Parekh: Yes, maybe I'll add a couple of more points as we think about just the margin going forward. A couple of observations I'd mention is every product cycle is different and over the years we have managed gross margin well. We've made good decisions balancing units revenue margins. When we launch new products, they tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace as we introduce new features and technologies. We do have a good track record of reducing those costs and structures over the life of the product. And our products and services all have different levels of profitability and their relative success in the marketplace has an impact on the overall gross margin. So I hope that's helpful color and context for you.\nWamsi Mohan: No, that's super helpful. Thank you. I guess you just noted that you weren't going to give services maybe a growth forecast here in light of some of the uncertain news. But maybe, Tim, could you share any color around what you have seen in developer behavior in areas like Europe where there has now been emergence of alternate app stores for a little more time? What have you seen anecdotally or within your data in terms of maybe develop a behavior, whether it's large or small? Any color you can share on what has like actually happened?\nTim Cook: It's embedded in our results that Kevan talked about earlier and embedded in the overall company color that was provided. But as you know, the Digital Markets Act went into effect in, I believe it was March of last year. And so the Digital Markets Act has been enacted for a bit over a year and there's been alternate app stores for some period of time of that. And so it's -- at this point in Europe, there are some embedded in the actuals. There may be more to come and so forth. I don't want to predict beyond the current quarter.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Wamsi. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I've got two as well, and Tim, this is more of a big picture supply chain philosophical question. So can you maybe update us on your thoughts on how you're thinking about your resiliency and redundancy, following the change that you guys talked about earlier on the call? I guess what I'm trying to understand is how do we think about where your supply chain is two to three years from now? And is there any risk, at least in the near term, of maybe some export control issues in your outlook for the balance of this year? And I'll give you my second one at the same time. You quantified a $900 million hit from tariffs. Or Kevan, is there any impact in how you're thinking about the demand backdrop in your outlook for the June quarter on the revenue line holistically? Thanks.\nTim Cook: In terms of the resiliency and risk, et cetera, there -- we have a complex supply chain. There's always risk in the supply chain. And so I wouldn't tell you anything different than that. What we learned some time ago was that having everything in one location had too much risk with it. And so we have, over time, with certain parts of the supply chain, not the whole thing, but certain parts of it opened up new sources of supply. And you could see that kind of thing continuing in the future. I'll let Kevan answer the other question.\nKevan Parekh: Hi, David. On the other question, I would say that our best thinking is captured in the outlook that we provided. However, I did want to reemphasize the point that the assumptions we made on the outlook do assume that the global tariff rates, the policies and application remain the same as they are today as of this call and that the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today.\nDavid Vogt: Okay. But no quantifiable impact on demand to date, at least from where we are over the last month? Is there a way to kind of think about that from early April to early May?\nKevan Parekh: I would say our best thinking is reflected in the range that we provided.\nDavid Vogt: Okay. Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, guys.\nKevan Parekh: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Tim, you made a comment on the last earnings call about Apple Intelligence making a visible impact on iPhone sales in the countries where it was available. I'm just curious if you continue to see that play out similarly in the more broader number of countries you've rolled that out. Or the delays that you talked about related to Siri, personalized Siri features, has that had an impact in terms of consumer willingness to upgrade? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, thank you for the question. During the March quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. A lot of the languages that I think you're referring to rolled out in April and so they actually rolled out in Q3.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. Then maybe for my follow-up, I mean, you have a lot of insights now in terms of what consumers or how consumers are reacting to the overall macro. And I know you prefaced all your guidance with macro remaining consistent. But how -- what are you seeing in terms of the U.S. consumer? And what's the reaction there in terms of the tariff impact? We saw U.S. GDP also shrink here in 1Q. When you look at velocity at the stores or trade down within the iPhone portfolio mix, what are you seeing in terms of how the consumer is reacting to the macro at this point? Thank you.\nTim Cook: I'm not an economist and so I'd start by saying that. In terms of the -- as you can see from a total company point of view, our results accelerated sequentially to the 5% level. And the U.S. is obviously the vast majority of the Americas segment, and you can see how the Americas performed during the quarter. And so that's all I want to say about that. I don't want to try to predict what happens in the months from now. The past, I'm quite pleased with the results from Q2.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them, too. Tim, thanks for that information on the $500 billion U.S. investment. I'm kind of curious how to think about the composition of that? How much is CapEx versus R&D? How much is going into like the Texas server? How much is going into maybe TSMC Arizona? Any kind of color you can give on that $500 billion investment would be helpful. And then I had a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Well, there's lots of all of it is what I would say. We're not giving out the exact split, but as we expand facilities in the different states from Michigan to Texas to California and Arizona and Nevada and Iowa and Oregon and North Carolina and Washington, there will be CapEx involved in that and OpEx involved in it. And standing up a server -- advanced server manufacturing in Texas, we did that through a partner. We do our manufacturing through a partner, but we'll be putting a fair amount in cost of goods sold to do that and some OpEx as well, and I'm sure some CapEx as well. And so it's a bit of all of it.\nKrish Sankar: Got it, got it. And then kind of had like a long term, more like a philosophical question. When you look at -- in the past, you've spoken about AI on the Edge. Obviously, it's very topical to hear from both the iPhone angle and the Mac angle. But I'm just kind of curious, when you look at AI on Edge, are the current smartphone specs or improved hardware and silicon specs good enough to meet future Edge LLM for inference? Or do you think you need somewhat of a whole new different kind of device? Just kind of curious how to think about the evolution of the Edge devices from here.\nTim Cook: Yes. As you know, we're shipping an LLM on the iPhone 16 today. And there are -- some of the queries that are being used by our customers are on-device, and then others go to the private cloud where we've essentially mimicked the security and privacy of the device into the cloud. And then others, for world knowledge, are with the integration with ChatGPT. And so there's -- we continue to be very excited about the opportunities here. We are very excited about the road map, and we are pleased with the progress that we're making.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, sir.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thank you very much. Wanted to ask about tariffs. Tim, given your recognition that a new Siri system is taking longer than you thought to deliver, I'd like to go back to my question from the last call and ask about what some of the learnings you had from those delays and whether you attribute them to organizational factors, to your legacy software stack? Or is it a matter of R&D spending? And what are some of the key gating factors investors should look for either at WWDC or beyond to have a sense that Apple can deliver on some of the promises of the announcements of the prior WWDC? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you sort of step back from what we said at WWDC, we talked about a number of different features that would launch with iOS 18. And we've released a slew of those from Writing Tools to seamlessly connecting to ChatGPT to Genmoji to Image Playground to Image Wand to Clean Up and Visual Intelligence, making movies or movies of your memories with a simple prompt, AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, the list goes on. And so we've delivered a lot, and we've just recently, just a few weeks ago, expanded it into several different languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, simplified Chinese as well as localized English for both Singapore and India. So we've delivered a lot. However, with regard to the more personal Siri, as you mentioned, we just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar. And there's not a lot of other reason for it. It's just taking a bit longer than we thought. But we are making progress, and we're extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there.\nKevan Parekh: And Richard, I'll just add that on your question about investment that we don't underestimate -- underinvest in our business. We make significant investments in R&D. That continues to grow. We're continuing to grow our R&D investment. And so we definitely are making all the investments we think we need to enable our road map.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks. And Kevan, 1 for you. I mean, it's hard to ignore some of the ongoing very high-profile legal cases that touch on Apple, be it yesterday's Epic case injunction or the Google antitrust trial touching on default search. And investors are clearly concerned that these might have material impacts on your Services business. Do you feel now that you have ample ways in which you might be able to mitigate some of the potential negative impacts on Apple Services business that might come about from what's been proposed or might come about in legal rather than commercial pressures that the business faces?\nTim Cook: Let me make a couple of comments on that before Kevan. The case yesterday, we strongly disagree with. We've complied with the court's order and we're going to appeal. In the DOJ case that you referenced with Google, that case is ongoing and I don't really have anything to add beyond that. And so we're monitoring these closely. But there -- as you point out, there's risk associated with them and the outcome is unclear.\nKevan Parekh: Yes, I think Tim answered it really well. I don't have anything to add to that.\nRichard Kramer: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. Operator, we will take our last question, please.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our last question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the AI strategy a little bit. I know, Tim, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned building some of your own foundational models. And I'm curious of how important you think it is for Apple to have their own foundational models. And kind of dovetailed with that is that, how do you think about your data center footprint when we look at Apple spending, call it, 3 billion a quarter relative to some of these other companies spending multiples of that. How does the strategy play out in your opinion?\nTim Cook: Well, we -- on the data center side, we have a hybrid strategy. And so we utilize third parties in addition to the data center investments that we're making. And as I've mentioned in the 500 billion, there's a number of states that we're expanding in. Some of those are data center investments. And so we do plan on making investments in that area and we're not gating it. We invest in the business first, as Kevan talked about, is our most important thing to do. In terms of the foundation models, we want to have certain models and we'll partner as well. And so I don't view it as a -- all of one or all of the other. We've been working on foundation models for quite some time and are shipping some today, obviously, with what's on-device and what's in the Private Cloud Compute.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And then as a follow-up, I'm curious with the iPhone 16e launching this quarter, internalizing your C1 modem, I'm curious of how you see kind of the modem strategy playing out or maybe just the continual deepening of that internal silicon opportunity for Apple?\nTim Cook: We're super excited to ship the first 1 and get it out there and it's gone well. We love that we can produce better products from a point of view of really focusing on battery life and other things that customers want. And so we're -- we have started on a journey is the way I would put it.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Aaron.

      "transcript": "Suhasini Chandramouli: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of tariffs and other trade measures and macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Additional information will also be in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 29, 2025 to be filed tomorrow and in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, we are reporting 95.4 billion in revenue, up 5% from a year ago and at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter record. Services achieved an all-time revenue record, growing 12% compared to the prior year. We also set a number of quarterly records in countries and regions across the world, including the UK, Spain, Finland, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, Poland, India, and the Philippines. We are as dedicated as ever to the innovation and ingenuity that will enrich our customers' lives and help us leave the world better than we found it. And we are proud to increase our impact around the world, including here in the United States, where we recently announced plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years. We're going to be expanding our teams in our facilities in several states, including Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. And we're going to be opening a new factory for advanced server manufacturing in Texas. During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year. We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company. All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the U.S. across all 50 states. Now I'll turn to products, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago. During the quarter, we introduced iPhone 16e, a great new entry-level addition to our iPhone 16 lineup. It's powered by our latest generation A18 chip and includes the all-new Apple-designed C1 modem, the most energy-efficient modem ever in an iPhone, allowing iPhone 16e to have the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone. Meanwhile, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus users are exploring how they can use Camera Control, whether capturing stunning images or exploring the world with Visual Intelligence. And our iPhone 16 Pro models continue to be a hit with our users. They are turbocharged by the remarkable capabilities and efficiency of A18 Pro and feature larger displays, an advanced camera system and a beautiful design. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, 7% higher year-over-year, another great quarter for Mac. During the quarter, we introduced significant new updates to our lineup. The world's most popular laptop just got even better. The M4-powered MacBook Air features a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera and delivers a massive boost in performance. And now it comes in a beautiful new sky blue color. The new Mac Studio is the most powerful Mac we've ever shipped, equipped with M4 Max and our new M3 Ultra chip. It's a true AI powerhouse capable of running large language models with over 600 billion parameters entirely in memory. Apple Intelligence brings great capabilities to the Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and get more done. Turning to iPad. Revenue for the quarter was $6.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago, another strong quarter of double digit growth. Our iPad lineup continues to help users learn, work, play, and go wherever their imaginations take them. The new iPad Air with M3 combines powerful performance and exceptional portability, whether you're taking it across the street or around the world. And Apple Intelligence and Apple Pencil Pro are a perfect match, with features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions, and Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% from a year ago. From walking trails to bike paths, Apple Watch Series 10 is an essential partner wherever you are on the health and fitness journey. And AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation delivers an extraordinary experience in an open-ear design. Customers continue to tell me how important our Hearing Health features for AirPods Pro 2 are to them, and we've been expanding their availability to reach even more users around the world. Millions have already taken hearing tests and the stories we received about the new hearing aid feature are deeply moving, showing how these innovations are making a real difference in people's daily lives. It's a powerful reminder of the impact technology can have when it's designed with care. Meanwhile, Apple Vision Pro takes the concert experience to a whole new level with Metallica, our latest Apple immersive video, which you have to see to believe. And visionOS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users while inviting them to explore a curated and regularly updated collection of spatial experiences with the Spatial Gallery app. In retail, in addition to the two stores we opened during the quarter, we're also looking forward to a new retail store in the UAE, the arrival of the online store in Saudi Arabia and new retail stores in India starting later this year. Let's now turn to Services, where we achieved an all-time revenue record of $26.6 billion, up 12% from a year ago with strong performance across all of our categories. From starting their morning with their podcast of choice to buying a coffee with Apple Pay to spending an afternoon reading the latest bestseller on Apple Books to using their favorite app from the App Store or an evening workout with Fitness+, Apple Services are enriching our users' lives all throughout their day. With incredible shows like The Studio, Your Friends & Neighbors and the culture-shaping Severance, Apple TV+ has become a must-see destination with record viewership during the quarter. And we're excited for our upcoming movie F1 starring Brad Pitt, which will hit theaters this summer and gives an incredible inside look at one of the most intense sports on Earth. And there is so much more to come this year. It's no wonder Apple TV+ has earned more than 2,500 award nominations and 560 wins. We're also reaching sports fans in more ways than ever, from watching our favorite teams go to bat on Friday Night Baseball to cheering on their local team with MLS Season Pass to following the results of every Grand Prix with Formula 1 now on the Apple Sports app. Turning to software. We just released iOS 18.4, which brought Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese as well as localized English to Singapore and India. AI and machine learning are core to so many profound features we've rolled out over the years to help our users live a better day. It's why we designed Apple Silicon with a neural engine that powers so many AI features across our products and third-party apps. It's also what makes Apple products the best devices for generative AI. At WWDC 24, we announced Apple Intelligence and shared our vision for integrating generative AI across our ecosystem into the apps and features our users rely on every day. To achieve this goal, we built our own highly capable foundation models that are specialized for everyday tasks. We designed helpful features that are right where our users need them and are easy to use. And we went to great lengths to build a system that protects user privacy, whether requests are processed on-device or in the cloud with Private Cloud Compute, an extraordinary step forward for privacy and AI. Since we launched iOS 18, we've released a number of Apple Intelligence features from helpful Writing Tools to Genmoji, Image Playground, Image Wand, Clean Up, Visual Intelligence and a seamless connection to ChatGPT, we made it possible for users to create movies of their memories with a simple prompt and added AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, summaries for mail, messages and more. We've also expanded these capabilities to more languages and regions. With regard to the more personal Siri features we announced, we need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high-quality bar. We are making progress and we look forward to getting these features into customers' hands. Turning to sustainability. We just celebrated Earth Day, and we were proud to announce that we've cut our emissions by 60% from our 2015 levels. Today, we're using more clean energy across our operations and more recycled materials in our products than ever. We have worked with suppliers to bring 17.8 gigawatts of renewable electricity online. We're also saving billions of gallons of freshwater and redirecting millions of metric tons of waste from landfills. All of this will help us make important progress towards our goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the life cycle of our products by 2030. Now let me walk you through the impacts of tariffs in the March quarter and give you some color on what we expect for the June quarter. For the March quarter, we had a limited impact from tariffs as we were able to optimize our supply chain and inventory. For the June quarter, currently, we are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter. However, for some color, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter. For our part, we will manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to innovation and the possibilities it creates. As we look ahead, we remain confident, confident that we will continue to build the world's best products and services, confident in our ability to innovate and enrich our users' lives, and confident that we can continue to run our business in a way that has always set Apple apart. Next month, we can't wait to welcome our developer community for the Worldwide Developers Conference, and we look forward to revealing some exciting announcements. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.\nKevan Parekh: Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter revenue of $95.4 billion was up 5% year-over-year despite a headwind of almost 2.5 percentage points from foreign exchange. We also grew in the majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $68.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year despite over 2 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds. And as Tim mentioned, this was an all-time revenue record. We also grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 47.1%, in the middle of our guidance range and up 20 basis points sequentially primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 35.9%, down 340 basis points sequentially, driven by mix, foreign exchange and a seasonal loss of leverage. Services gross margin was 75.7%, up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a different mix, partly offset by foreign exchange. Operating expenses landed at $15.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was $24.8 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter record. Operating cash flow was also strong at $24 billion. Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% year- over-year driven by the iPhone 16 family. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total and in every geographic segment, and iPhone upgraders grew double-digits year-over-year. According to a recent survey from Kantar, during the March quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. And we continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 97% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year, driven by the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini models. This performance was broad-based with every geographic segment growing year-over-year. Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw strong growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Customer satisfaction was reported at 95% in the U.S. iPad revenue was $6.4 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new M3-powered iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Keep in mind, we did face a more difficult compare against the launch of the Apple Vision Pro in the year ago quarter as well as the Watch Ultra 2 launched last year. At the same time, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And customer satisfaction for Watch in the U.S. was recently measured at 95%. Our Services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year. This growth rate was comparable to the December quarter year-over-year growth rate when we removed the negative impact from foreign exchange. We saw strong momentum in the March quarter and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our Services offerings also continue to grow. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our service offerings from additional features in News+ to new games available on Arcade. Apple Pay continues to help our customers with an easy, secure and private payment solution, and we were pleased to see that our active users in Apple Pay reached an all-time record, up double-digits year-over-year. Turning to enterprise. Organizations are investing more on Apple products and services to drive productivity and employee engagement. For example, KPMG recently rolled out iPhone 16 for all U.S. employees, reflecting their confidence in Apple's security and privacy features. We also continue to see strong Mac performance in enterprise. New Bank, the largest digital bank in Latin America has selected MacBook Air as a standard computer for their thousands of employees. With Vision Pro, companies are continuing to find new and innovative ways to leverage this technology. Dassault Systèmes, a leading provider for engineering and 3D design software has natively integrated Apple Vision Pro into their next-generation platform, bringing a powerful and immersive spatial experience to thousands of enterprise customers. Now let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $3 billion in debt maturities and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $98 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $35 billion. During the quarter, we returned $29 billion to shareholders. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 108 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today, our Board authorized an additional $100 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.26 per share of common stock, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we have done for the last 13 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2025. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call. And the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today for the current quarter. Despite the overall uncertain environment, we will still be providing color at the total company level, subject to these assumptions and the risk factors that we referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, which includes the estimated impact of the $900 million of tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: Great, thanks so much guys for taking my questions. Tim, I'd love to maybe touch on the tariff point first. There were comments from you earlier on CNBC talking about 50% of iPhones for the U.S. currently coming from India. Where do you expect the mix of India-sourced iPhones for the U.S. to be by the end of your fiscal year? And is it the goal to source 100% of your U.S.-bound iPhones from India? Can you just help us understand kind of how we should expect that to trend as we look beyond just the June quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, Erik, hi. It's Tim. The existing tariffs that apply to Apple today are based on the product's country of origin as you alluded to. For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the -- also sold in the U.S. China would continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of total product sales outside the U.S. And so if you look at the categories of tariffs that are applicable to us today, for the June quarter, most of our tariff exposure relates to the February IEEPA-related tariff at the rate of 20%, which applies to imports to the U.S. for products that have China as their country of origin. In addition, for China, there was an additional 125% tariff for imports of certain categories of products announced in April. And for us, that's some of our U.S. AppleCare and Accessories businesses and brings the total rate in China for these products to at least 145%. Also for transparency and clarity, the vast majority of our products, including iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Vision Pro, are currently not subject to the global reciprocal tariffs that were announced in April as the Commerce Department has initiated a Section 232 investigation into imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and downstream products that contain semiconductors. And so if you -- for the June quarter, as I talked about in the -- in my opening comments, we estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff, rates, policies and applications don't change for the balance of the quarter, to be 900 million to our costs. I wouldn't want to predict the mix of production in the future, but I wanted to give you clarity for the June quarter of where the country of origins are so you can use that for your modeling.\nErik Woodring: Okay. I appreciate that color. Thank, Tim. And then maybe my follow-up is there were a number of reports during the quarter that Apple had pulled forward sell-in into the channel to get ahead of tariffs. So can you just help us better kind of understand or clarify if sell-in and sell-through were aligned in the March quarter? If you're assuming that they would be aligned in the June quarter guide? And ultimately, do you believe that consumers are accelerating hardware purchases to get ahead of any potential pricing increases or was behavior normal? Thank you so much, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes. Thanks, Erik, for the question. There are several questions there. One, in terms of the pull forward in demand, if you look at the March quarter, we don't believe that we saw obvious evidence of a significant pull forward in demand in the March quarter due to tariffs. If you look at our channel inventory, from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, the unit channel inventory was similar, not only for iPhone but for the balance of our products. Again, for transparency, you will see that we did build ahead inventory, and that's reflected in our manufacturing purchase obligations that you'll see on the quarterly filing when it comes out. So I hope that makes the -- answers all your questions.\nErik Woodring: Thank you so much, Tim. Good Luck.\nTim Cook: Thanks.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Eric. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hi, thanks a lot. Tim, if you had told me that on April 2 that your hit from tariffs was only a nickel-ish a quarter at 900 million, that would have been a pretty good outcome, given the panic that ensued. I'm surprised that it's that low. But then you did make a comment about after the June quarter, and sorry to push you on that, but could it be a multiple of that figure or is it just completely unknown? We're all just trying to figure out what happens after June. And if there's just any guidance you guys can possibly give that it's bigger, smaller or what? And hoping you can just give us a little color on that. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yes, Ben. Thanks for the question. I tried to give you some information in the previous question about the country of origin, which currently is the key factor in determining the tariffs that we're paying. I don't want to predict the future because I'm not sure what will happen with the tariffs, and there is the Section 232 investigation going on. And so it's very difficult to predict beyond June. And June has the assumptions in it that I had mentioned earlier.\nBen Reitzes: All right, Tim. And then just with regard to China down 2%, I mean, you intuitively would have thought there would have been an increased nationalism there and perhaps it would have been worse than that. And the trajectory there improving even with subsidies because subsidies benefited your competitors, too. Just wondering if I could get a little more color there. Can it keep improving? What are you thinking with regard to that trajectory in China, given all the geopolitical tensions? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yes, we were down 2%, as you point out, for the March quarter. And to provide a little more transparency around that, we were roughly flat when you remove the headwinds from foreign exchange. And so we did see quite a bit of sequential improvement from the December quarter, which was down 11. And again, for going out of the way for transparency, the channel inventory at the end of March, the unit channel inventory was similar to where we started the quarter. So there wasn't a build of channel inventory in there. I do believe that the subsidies played a favorable impact on the results. It's difficult to estimate with precision as to exactly how much, but I think it was positive. Some of our products are included. Some of them are not. Generally, on iPhone, if something is priced above RMB6,000, it is not eligible for the subsidy and the other products have different rules. But I do think it helped. And I think it's helping others as well, I'm sure. iPhone was the key driver of the improvement sequentially. And so hopefully, that provides you some color. The other thing I would say is that the Mac, the iPad, and the Watch are attracting a majority of customers new to that product. And so that continues to look quite good in China. And iPhone was the top two models in urban China, and iPad was the top two tablets in urban China. So there's some positive nuggets there.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes. Thank you, Ben.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your responses on some of this trade policy uncertainty. I appreciated the transparency around building ahead with inventory. Will you continue to do that in this interim period until we get some clarity on Section 232 investigation? And could you talk a little bit about your philosophy on pricing, elevated costs to the extent that comes through, whether that be to resellers or end consumers and other efficiency efforts that you might be able to pursue? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. Obviously, we're very engaged on the tariff discussions. We believe in engagement and we'll continue to engage. On the pricing piece, we have nothing to announce today. And I'll just say that the operational team has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain and the inventory. And we'll obviously continue to do those things to the degree that we can.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up for Kevan, on product gross margins, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the factors that may have impacted product gross margins in the quarter. Obviously, down sequentially on seasonal factors but there was a year-over-year decline as well. So any additional color would be helpful? Thank you.\nKevan Parekh: Yes, Michael, thanks. This is Kevan. So on the sequential, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had a decrease in the product gross margin by 340 basis points sequentially. That was primarily driven by mix, seasonal loss of leverage, foreign exchange and that was partly offset by cost savings. And when we look at the year-on-year performance, we were down 70 basis points on a year-on- year basis. And that was driven by a different mix and foreign exchange.\nMichael Ng: Thank you.\nKevan Parekh: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. I guess I'll have to start with a tariff question as well. Tim, I think when you talked about the 900 million impact to your cost of goods sold, you sort of had a statement that there are certain unique factors that benefit you in the June quarter related to that number. Can you just talk about what are these unique factors that are benefiting you in the June quarter? And what would the impact be without those benefits essentially?\nTim Cook: I wouldn't want to go through all of them. But as an example, the build ahead that is -- I mentioned earlier that's in the manufacturing purchase obligations is -- were helpful.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then as I think about the June quarter guide of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, I was wondering, do you folks expect services growth to remain in the double-digit range as you go into the back half of the year? I imagine FX is a bit of a benefit as you go to the back half. I would love to just understand, within that framework, how do you think services stacks up as you go through the June quarter?\nKevan Parekh: Yes, Amit. Hi, it's Kevan. So I think when we talk about the overall June quarter, we talk about the low to mid-single digits year- over-year. We do expect foreign exchange in the June quarter to improve sequentially. However, we are expecting it to be a slight headwind to revenue on a year-on-year basis. With respect to services, given the uncertainty we see from several factors, we aren't providing the category level of color today.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. Thank you.\nKevan Parekh: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Tim or Kevan, how should investors think about the gross margin trajectory as you source more from the U.S. in particular or other supply chain changes that you are making, including in India? How should those kind of play into the cost structure and how should we think about that gross margin trajectory and I will follow-up?\nTim Cook: We're excited about bringing more production to the U.S. As you know, we've been very key in the TSMC project in Arizona and are the largest and first customer getting product out of that. And that's the SoC that's coming out of there. We also have glass coming out of the U.S. and the Face ID module and loads of chips. In fact, there's 19 billion chips coming out across 12 states. This is down to the resistor and capacitor level, obviously. And so there's some that is already built into the margins that Kevan has quoted. And we don't really forecast beyond the current quarter as you know.\nKevan Parekh: Yes, maybe I'll add a couple of more points as we think about just the margin going forward. A couple of observations I'd mention is every product cycle is different and over the years we have managed gross margin well. We've made good decisions balancing units revenue margins. When we launch new products, they tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace as we introduce new features and technologies. We do have a good track record of reducing those costs and structures over the life of the product. And our products and services all have different levels of profitability and their relative success in the marketplace has an impact on the overall gross margin. So I hope that's helpful color and context for you.\nWamsi Mohan: No, that's super helpful. Thank you. I guess you just noted that you weren't going to give services maybe a growth forecast here in light of some of the uncertain news. But maybe, Tim, could you share any color around what you have seen in developer behavior in areas like Europe where there has now been emergence of alternate app stores for a little more time? What have you seen anecdotally or within your data in terms of maybe develop a behavior, whether it's large or small? Any color you can share on what has like actually happened?\nTim Cook: It's embedded in our results that Kevan talked about earlier and embedded in the overall company color that was provided. But as you know, the Digital Markets Act went into effect in, I believe it was March of last year. And so the Digital Markets Act has been enacted for a bit over a year and there's been alternate app stores for some period of time of that. And so it's -- at this point in Europe, there are some embedded in the actuals. There may be more to come and so forth. I don't want to predict beyond the current quarter.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Wamsi. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I've got two as well, and Tim, this is more of a big picture supply chain philosophical question. So can you maybe update us on your thoughts on how you're thinking about your resiliency and redundancy, following the change that you guys talked about earlier on the call? I guess what I'm trying to understand is how do we think about where your supply chain is two to three years from now? And is there any risk, at least in the near term, of maybe some export control issues in your outlook for the balance of this year? And I'll give you my second one at the same time. You quantified a $900 million hit from tariffs. Or Kevan, is there any impact in how you're thinking about the demand backdrop in your outlook for the June quarter on the revenue line holistically? Thanks.\nTim Cook: In terms of the resiliency and risk, et cetera, there -- we have a complex supply chain. There's always risk in the supply chain. And so I wouldn't tell you anything different than that. What we learned some time ago was that having everything in one location had too much risk with it. And so we have, over time, with certain parts of the supply chain, not the whole thing, but certain parts of it opened up new sources of supply. And you could see that kind of thing continuing in the future. I'll let Kevan answer the other question.\nKevan Parekh: Hi, David. On the other question, I would say that our best thinking is captured in the outlook that we provided. However, I did want to reemphasize the point that the assumptions we made on the outlook do assume that the global tariff rates, the policies and application remain the same as they are today as of this call and that the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today.\nDavid Vogt: Okay. But no quantifiable impact on demand to date, at least from where we are over the last month? Is there a way to kind of think about that from early April to early May?\nKevan Parekh: I would say our best thinking is reflected in the range that we provided.\nDavid Vogt: Okay. Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, guys.\nKevan Parekh: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Tim, you made a comment on the last earnings call about Apple Intelligence making a visible impact on iPhone sales in the countries where it was available. I'm just curious if you continue to see that play out similarly in the more broader number of countries you've rolled that out. Or the delays that you talked about related to Siri, personalized Siri features, has that had an impact in terms of consumer willingness to upgrade? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, thank you for the question. During the March quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. A lot of the languages that I think you're referring to rolled out in April and so they actually rolled out in Q3.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. Then maybe for my follow-up, I mean, you have a lot of insights now in terms of what consumers or how consumers are reacting to the overall macro. And I know you prefaced all your guidance with macro remaining consistent. But how -- what are you seeing in terms of the U.S. consumer? And what's the reaction there in terms of the tariff impact? We saw U.S. GDP also shrink here in 1Q. When you look at velocity at the stores or trade down within the iPhone portfolio mix, what are you seeing in terms of how the consumer is reacting to the macro at this point? Thank you.\nTim Cook: I'm not an economist and so I'd start by saying that. In terms of the -- as you can see from a total company point of view, our results accelerated sequentially to the 5% level. And the U.S. is obviously the vast majority of the Americas segment, and you can see how the Americas performed during the quarter. And so that's all I want to say about that. I don't want to try to predict what happens in the months from now. The past, I'm quite pleased with the results from Q2.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them, too. Tim, thanks for that information on the $500 billion U.S. investment. I'm kind of curious how to think about the composition of that? How much is CapEx versus R&D? How much is going into like the Texas server? How much is going into maybe TSMC Arizona? Any kind of color you can give on that $500 billion investment would be helpful. And then I had a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Well, there's lots of all of it is what I would say. We're not giving out the exact split, but as we expand facilities in the different states from Michigan to Texas to California and Arizona and Nevada and Iowa and Oregon and North Carolina and Washington, there will be CapEx involved in that and OpEx involved in it. And standing up a server -- advanced server manufacturing in Texas, we did that through a partner. We do our manufacturing through a partner, but we'll be putting a fair amount in cost of goods sold to do that and some OpEx as well, and I'm sure some CapEx as well. And so it's a bit of all of it.\nKrish Sankar: Got it, got it. And then kind of had like a long term, more like a philosophical question. When you look at -- in the past, you've spoken about AI on the Edge. Obviously, it's very topical to hear from both the iPhone angle and the Mac angle. But I'm just kind of curious, when you look at AI on Edge, are the current smartphone specs or improved hardware and silicon specs good enough to meet future Edge LLM for inference? Or do you think you need somewhat of a whole new different kind of device? Just kind of curious how to think about the evolution of the Edge devices from here.\nTim Cook: Yes. As you know, we're shipping an LLM on the iPhone 16 today. And there are -- some of the queries that are being used by our customers are on-device, and then others go to the private cloud where we've essentially mimicked the security and privacy of the device into the cloud. And then others, for world knowledge, are with the integration with ChatGPT. And so there's -- we continue to be very excited about the opportunities here. We are very excited about the road map, and we are pleased with the progress that we're making.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, sir.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thank you very much. Wanted to ask about tariffs. Tim, given your recognition that a new Siri system is taking longer than you thought to deliver, I'd like to go back to my question from the last call and ask about what some of the learnings you had from those delays and whether you attribute them to organizational factors, to your legacy software stack? Or is it a matter of R&D spending? And what are some of the key gating factors investors should look for either at WWDC or beyond to have a sense that Apple can deliver on some of the promises of the announcements of the prior WWDC? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you sort of step back from what we said at WWDC, we talked about a number of different features that would launch with iOS 18. And we've released a slew of those from Writing Tools to seamlessly connecting to ChatGPT to Genmoji to Image Playground to Image Wand to Clean Up and Visual Intelligence, making movies or movies of your memories with a simple prompt, AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, the list goes on. And so we've delivered a lot, and we've just recently, just a few weeks ago, expanded it into several different languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, simplified Chinese as well as localized English for both Singapore and India. So we've delivered a lot. However, with regard to the more personal Siri, as you mentioned, we just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar. And there's not a lot of other reason for it. It's just taking a bit longer than we thought. But we are making progress, and we're extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there.\nKevan Parekh: And Richard, I'll just add that on your question about investment that we don't underestimate -- underinvest in our business. We make significant investments in R&D. That continues to grow. We're continuing to grow our R&D investment. And so we definitely are making all the investments we think we need to enable our road map.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks. And Kevan, 1 for you. I mean, it's hard to ignore some of the ongoing very high-profile legal cases that touch on Apple, be it yesterday's Epic case injunction or the Google antitrust trial touching on default search. And investors are clearly concerned that these might have material impacts on your Services business. Do you feel now that you have ample ways in which you might be able to mitigate some of the potential negative impacts on Apple Services business that might come about from what's been proposed or might come about in legal rather than commercial pressures that the business faces?\nTim Cook: Let me make a couple of comments on that before Kevan. The case yesterday, we strongly disagree with. We've complied with the court's order and we're going to appeal. In the DOJ case that you referenced with Google, that case is ongoing and I don't really have anything to add beyond that. And so we're monitoring these closely. But there -- as you point out, there's risk associated with them and the outcome is unclear.\nKevan Parekh: Yes, I think Tim answered it really well. I don't have anything to add to that.\nRichard Kramer: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. Operator, we will take our last question, please.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our last question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the AI strategy a little bit. I know, Tim, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned building some of your own foundational models. And I'm curious of how important you think it is for Apple to have their own foundational models. And kind of dovetailed with that is that, how do you think about your data center footprint when we look at Apple spending, call it, 3 billion a quarter relative to some of these other companies spending multiples of that. How does the strategy play out in your opinion?\nTim Cook: Well, we -- on the data center side, we have a hybrid strategy. And so we utilize third parties in addition to the data center investments that we're making. And as I've mentioned in the 500 billion, there's a number of states that we're expanding in. Some of those are data center investments. And so we do plan on making investments in that area and we're not gating it. We invest in the business first, as Kevan talked about, is our most important thing to do. In terms of the foundation models, we want to have certain models and we'll partner as well. And so I don't view it as a -- all of one or all of the other. We've been working on foundation models for quite some time and are shipping some today, obviously, with what's on-device and what's in the Private Cloud Compute.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And then as a follow-up, I'm curious with the iPhone 16e launching this quarter, internalizing your C1 modem, I'm curious of how you see kind of the modem strategy playing out or maybe just the continual deepening of that internal silicon opportunity for Apple?\nTim Cook: We're super excited to ship the first 1 and get it out there and it's gone well. We love that we can produce better products from a point of view of really focusing on battery life and other things that customers want. And so we're -- we have started on a journey is the way I would put it.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Aaron.

    "fullTranscript": "Suhasini Chandramouli: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness Plus, Beats and more LA is home to many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts and we will continue to support our teams and the local community. Now turning to the quarter. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, up 4% from a year ago, and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see momentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among others. In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record, and in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business. I'm also pleased to announce that we reached a new record for our installed base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now users can discover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use writing tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with clean up. We introduced visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings. Users can also seamlessly access chat GPT across iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international expansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence even further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India. And we'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable Siri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple Intelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like Private Cloud Compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud. Apple Intelligence opens up an exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative tools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching all-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions. Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and Apple Intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in battery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays and a pro camera system so advanced it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher year-over-year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup. The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launchpad to enable users to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of chips to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the super portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly capable, but is our first carbon neutral Mac. All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple Silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers, who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad from the ultra-portal iPad Mini, built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users whenever they need it and wherever they go and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup. Wearables home and accessories revenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect companion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year. From the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an ever-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips and watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to continuing to advance this work, because we know how much it matters to our users. We've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2, and new sleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. During the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are enjoying incredible immersive entertainment experiences and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display. Vision Pro is also supercharging the creative process and the incredibly talented director John M. Chu recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie Wicked to life. Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan. Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible storytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season of Severance earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like The Studio and Your Friends and Neighbors. And we can't wait for the premiere of Formula 1 starring Brad Pitt on June 27, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that Apple TV+ continues to draw attention and accolades. To-date, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the quarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My Service that can help our users when they lose their luggage. For the first time, if you put an air tag in your suitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines, so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our teams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season. We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain, and the U.S. and we were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE and bringing our online store to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning in 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members. There's an incredible energy and passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I recently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father was an AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment. Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. And there are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing health feature like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren. These are the kind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and potential. We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good and putting all of our energy and ingenuity into making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.\nKevan Parekh: Thanks Tim, and good afternoon everyone. I'm going to cover the results for the first quarter of our fiscal year. We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac. Thanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments and is now over 2.35 billion active devices. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We grew in every geographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high-end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix. Operating expenses of $15.4 billion landed at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 7% year-over-year. This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of the $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision. Now, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year. We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total in an average geographic segment. We also set an all-time record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Kantar during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 96% as measured by 451 research. Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year. We saw strength across our lineup from the new Mac Mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. This incredible performance was broad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple Silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw a double-digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the U.S. was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new iPad Mini and latest iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the U.S. based on the latest reports from 451 Research. Wearable's home and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4 and the latest hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2. On watch, although we face a difficult compare against the watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for watch in the U.S. was reported at 94%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Services continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services offerings, from new games on Apple Arcade to exciting new programming on Fitness Plus, and the continued expansion of features like Tap to Pay, now live in 20 markets. Turning to enterprise, we have seen businesses continue to expand their deployments of our products and services. Deutsche Bank launched its Mac as Choice program for the developers and also issued the latest MacBook Air as a standard computer for their entire mortgage lending division. And we're excited to see leading enterprises such as SAP leverage Apple Intelligence in the U.S., with features like writing tools, summarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences. We also see strong demand in our emerging markets. For example, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed 1,000 of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation. In Vision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise, with Cisco's new spatial meetings delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning. Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar is strengthened significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single-digits year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow low-double-digits year-over-year. When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025. With that, let's open to call the questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Kevin. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: Certainly, we will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Great guys, Thanks so much for taking my questions. Tim, in your prepared remarks, you had noted that iPhone 16 models are selling better in markets where Apple Intelligence is available? And I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment a bit and share any other details you believe could better help us understand how Apple Intelligence is really impacting iPhone demand and/or what features you find that users are using most often already? And then I just have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, Eric. Hi, it's Tim. The -- we did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. In terms of the features that people are using, they're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments from writing tools to image playground and Genmoji to visual intelligence and more. And so we see all of those being used. The cleanup is another one that is popular and people love seeing that one demoed in the stores as well. We only had 2, 2.5 weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of [18.2] (ph) and then only had the U.K. and the other English language countries for the 2.5 weeks. And so we've got just the early indications at the moment, but we were glad…\nErik Woodring: Okay, that's really helpful.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nErik Woodring: Okay, thank you for that, Tim. It's helpful. And then, you know, if we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently, if we set aside China Macro, which I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that that Apple faces, whether that's, you know, shifting preferences for Western technology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is, you know, not necessarily helping replacement cycles. Just maybe double clicking on, on what you think and what you're hearing in China as a regard as it relates to the iPhone. Thanks so much.\nTim Cook: Yes, sure. If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year-over-year. And over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And of course on the Apple intelligence side we have not rolled out in China and as we just talked about we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in. And of course, it's the most competitive market in the world. And so all of those things are true. In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced in very recently in January that did not affect the December quarter. There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was announced, I believe, on January 20. And it does cover the categories that we have products in from smartphones to tablets and PCs and smart watches up to a certain, a maximum price point. And so we do see fiscal stimulus occurring and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much, Tim. Good luck.\nTim Cook: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Eric. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. And, hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you who -- you knew this one was coming, but there's a perception that you're a big beneficiary of lower cost of compute and I was wondering if you could give your worldly perspective here on the DeepSeek situation and if you are going to, if you, if anything's happened to change your views in terms of a tailwind to margins and your ability to execute even due to the potential for cost to come down due to that development and probably what was going to happen anyway. But I'd love your perspective on that and then have a quick follow-up. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Sure. In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. And that's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well. As you know, we do things on the device, and we do things in the private cloud and which mimics from a architectural point of view the -- what happens on the device. And from a CapEx point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure and we continue to leverage a hybrid model, which I think continues to serve us well.\nBen Reitzes: Oh, great. All right. Thanks, Tim. And then, you know, just with regard to, you know, the iPhone trajectory, do you feel like, I guess, what is -- you obviously don't talk about new products and stuff like that, but do you feel that there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future? Or do you feel that the current lineup kind of it shows where you're going? I guess without pulling punches wondering if you, you thought you know in terms of the phone innovation if there's a lot more to come and you could see the kind of current market changing a bit over the next two to three years. Thanks.\nTim Cook: I think, Ben, I think there's a lot more to come and I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline. So I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes, thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I have two as well. First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone upgraders, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you would attribute this upgrade strength to? Has Apple Intelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yes, thank you for the question. If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The installed base hit a new all-time high as well. And if you look at the 16, compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is across now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15. And so I think you can conclude from that, that there are compelling reasons to upgrade. And in the markets where we had launched Apple Intelligence, they outperformed the markets that we did not. So lots…\nMichael Ng: Great, thank you, Tim. That's…\nTim Cook: Yes, lots of good color there.\nMichael Ng: Great, thank you, Tim. That's very clear. And then I had one about the iPad Pro and for the thinner version. I was just wondering if you could talk about that thin form factor for the iPad Pro. How did it help iPad sales overall and what did your kind of marketing consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor? Thank you.\nTim Cook: It's a good question. iPad overall grew 15% for the quarter and it was more driven by iPad Air and the entry level iPad than it was the top level iPad. But overall we could not be more pleased with the iPad category growing 15%. It's a great achievement for the quarter. And probably what is most important is that over half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the iPad. So that tells us that there's a good amount of customers there to attract.\nMichael Ng: Thank you very much, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon, everyone. I have two as well. Maybe to start with, you folks are seeing some very robust growth trends in emerging markets right now for Apple products? Can you just add a high level, just talk about the durability of growth that you see in emerging markets? And then do you think the summation of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or perhaps starting to grow fast enough that it can actually offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?\nTim Cook: We have great results in a number of emerging markets. And as you know from past calls, I'm particularly keen on India. India set a December quarter record during the quarter. And we're opening more stores there. We've announced that we're going to open four new stores there. We also, the iPhone was the top selling model in India for the quarter. And it's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the third largest for PCs and tablets and so there's a huge market and we are -- we have very modest share in these markets. And so I think there's lots of upside there. And that's just one of the emerging markets.\nKevan Parekh: Yes, maybe I'll add, Amit, that in emerging markets we're also seeing double-digit growth on the install base, both in total and for the iPhone as well. So that's also an encouraging sign.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you. And then, you know, just a question on gross margins for the March quarter. You folks are guiding gross margin is flattish on a sequential basis. Typically, I think it tends to be guided up a little bit, 50 basis points, so sequentially. Can we just touch on like, what are the offsets of the puts and takes you see here on gross margins? And Kevan, maybe you can just talked about its FX having an outsized impact in your margin profile as well in March?\nKevan Parekh: Yes, Amit, let me take that One. You know, as we mentioned in my remarks, we're guiding to 46.5% to 47.5%. So we think it's, you know, we're very pleased with that level of guidance. As you mentioned, there's always puts and takes. We do think there's going to be some FX headwinds, which we talked about, that's going to affect, you know, our revenue growth as well. You know, it'll have an impact here on the margin, a sequential impact on margins. But we think that's going to be offset by favorable costs and the relative mix of services. We also, as you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, especially on the product side, because Q1 is such a large quarter for a products business, we do have a loss of leverage. So there are some puts and takes, and I think we feel good about the range. We think it's a very, very strong guide for gross margin.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Tim, I want to follow-up on your comment about channel inventory in China. I was wondering if you could maybe address more broadly if channel inventory across your different product lines and regions? Do you feel they're elevated or out of range in any other regions? And given the clearing event that kind of happened in China, I guess in the quarter, should we think of a more normal progression quarter-on-quarter into the March quarter in China in particular, and I will follow.\nTim Cook: Yes, I don't want to project sales for the current quarter by region, but if you if you look at the channel inventory and look at iPhone in the aggregate, so on a worldwide basis we're very comfortable with our channel inventory position in the -- in China my point was that our channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that was over half of the reduction in the reported results. And so if you look, part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, that's very clear. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, thank you.\nWamsi Mohan: And then maybe as my follow-up, your services growth has been very strong and I know you've kind of been navigating some pretty challenging regulatory burdens on the business globally. So how should investors think about maybe either a top line or margin headwind that let's say you're currently absorbing in your results that could potentially maybe reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment? Thank you so much.\nKevan Parekh: Yes. So I think one, I just wanted to kind of reiterate the fact that, you know, our services business had an all-time record for December quarter of 14%. And that was a one strength that we saw across all geographic segments and also was very broad base across all of our services. So we have, as you know, a very broad services portfolio. And so we do see, you know, good momentum across the board. And as well, we continue to see increasing engagement across the customer base, across all of the service offerings, both transacting and paid accounts. We talked about reaching all-time highs, and we have over now 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services platform.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess for the first one, if I -- I mean, you had a great quarter on Macs and iPads both. And I'm just curious, in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double-digit growth that you saw in both the product lines, and more interest are also here, we are talking about Apple Intelligence sort of influencing volumes on iPhones, but any thoughts on sort of how -- what does that influence look like in terms of volumes for Macs, for example, where I think there's a lot of conversation on AI PCs, how you're thinking about the impact there? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at Mac, Mac was up 16% and on iPad, we were up 15%. The Mac was driven by the very strong uptake on our new products during the quarter and the continued success of the MacBook Air. And so as you know, we've launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac and a Mac Mini during the quarter. We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads. The silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads. And so I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And Tim, I'm going to use your earlier discussion about India as a strong emerging market to sort of ask you about the supply chain planning there in terms of how much of the supply chain planning there that you're doing is more of a reflection of the growth expectations from that market relative to in terms of diversification of the supply chain? And how should we sort of think about that strategy in terms of that particular country? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at the manufacturing we do there, we do manufacturing both for the domestic market, and we export. And so in -- our business needs a certain economies of scale for it to make sense to manufacture in country. And so that really means that we're going to be both a use for the domestic market and an export market.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, thanks.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great, thanks, guys, for taking my question. So maybe, Tim, this is for you. I'm trying to think about your commentary around Apple Intelligence being sort of a momentum driver for the iPhone business. But when I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter, if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the last couple of years, kind of, feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter last year? So how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years? And then second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, obviously, you've done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you think we sit in terms of, on the services side at least, where margins could go? It looks like the 75% margin has been incredibly successful quarter. But just trying to get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the intermediate term? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was, that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. And so that gives us -- it's a positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling reasons to upgrade. And the other thing I would say, that I think I mentioned earlier, is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and so that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family. And so I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April. And so it will be at the -- in our Q3 quarter. And I'll let Kevan take the gross margin question.\nDavid Vogt: Yes, great.\nKevan Parekh: Hi, David. How are you? So on the Services gross margin, I think maybe just stepping back a second. Services business in general in aggregate is accretive to the overall company margin. And one of the things, as an important reminder, is we've got a very broad services portfolio. And those businesses have very different margin profiles. And so I think, one, it's because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. And so one of the big factors that drive the Services gross margins and relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio. We also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud, that are actually growing. And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being accretive to margins as well. And so in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver that 75% margin at the services level. And I think our guidance takes into consideration what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint of 46.5% to 47.5%, which again, we think is a strong guide.\nDavid Vogt: Great, thanks, guys.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right, thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I also had two of them. One, the first one for Tim. You had very strong Mac growth, 16% year-over-year last quarter. Just wondering how much of that was driven by some of the Mac silicon innovation versus a replacement cycle for Macs?\nTim Cook: I don't know the answer to your question precisely, but I think it is a combination of these products are so compelling, the M4-based products are so compelling, that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level and it's driving switchers at a double-digit level. And so we're seeing both come out, and I think it's just because of the compelling products.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks for that, Tim. And then a follow-up for Kevan on the gross margin. I want to ask you on the product side. Last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to a year ago period. I'm kind of curious how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin? Or do you think with some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?\nKevan Parekh: Yes. Thanks, Krish, for the question. So on the product side, as you mentioned, we had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points, for the December quarter. That was really driven by, we talked about, favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume. I would say, in general, our gross margin on products is driven by a number of factors. One of them is the various product launches that we have. Different products do have different margin profiles. And so that mix does make a difference. And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mix is across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate towards our Pro products because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get into our best products, which have favorable gross margins. So we're continuing to see that trend, that impacted us in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. And then that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter, but we figured that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave, the 46.5% to 47.5%.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks very much. My first question is for Tim. I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption. I guess do you see this simply as a question of time i.e., to launch more markets and languages or increase the percentage of installed base devices that can support it? Or is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend towards AI? And based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream? Thanks.\nTim Cook: I do believe it will go mainstream. I'm getting feedback from people using different features today. And this is -- keep in mind that on the iPhone side of our business, you either have to have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 to use Apple Intelligence. And so the -- as that base grows, I think the usage will continue to grow. And I think -- I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features, you can't imagine not using them anymore. I know I get 100s of e-mails a day, and the summarization function is so important. So I think it's a combination of that. And of course, in April, we roll out a whole series of new languages that we had mentioned, and so the base grows further.\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thank you. And then, Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was really getting Apple to record margin levels and also maintaining very consistent pricing across the product range. But taking the current high levels of profitability as fairly stable, what observations might you share about price sensitivity of users and whether having a wider range of pricing across the products might unlocks potentially further market share gains or boost overall product growth?\nKevan Parekh: Yes, it's a good question. I think one, I don't think we're going to really depart from what served us pretty well to now. I mean we always take it into consideration, looking at short-term -- comparison between the short term and the long term. I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy, which would serve us pretty well. And I think we're going to continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell.\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thanks.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. How do you guys see the potential tariff impact to your product for consumer demand under Trump 2.0 you guys did find under Trump 1.0?\nTim Cook: We are monitoring the situation and don't have anything more to add than that.\nAtif Malik: Great. And Tim, as a follow-up, there is a lot of discussion on agentic AI, the use of agents. Do you guys see the upgraded series expected in April as something that will, let's say, be the killer application among the suite of features that you have announced in Apple Intelligence?\nTim Cook: I think the killer feature is different for different people. But I think for most, they're going to find that they're going to use many of the features every day. And certainly, one of those is the -- is Siri, and that will be coming over the next several months.\nAtif Malik: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Atif. Operator, could we please get the last question?\nOperator: Our last question is from Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.\nBen Bollin: Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I'm interested in your thoughts and how you would have us think about the average useful life of these devices in the wild. And in particular, curious, if you look at the strength you saw in fiscal ‘21 and how that might support accelerated refresh opportunity into the future?\nTim Cook: Yes. Ben, I think it's different for different types of users. I mean you have very early adopter kind of users that are very quick to jump on the latest technology that upgrade very frequently. And then you have people that are on the entire opposite side of that barbell. And most people are between those two points. And so I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the COVID period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company to -- for more than one of the product categories.\nBen Bollin: That’s it from me. Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Ben.

Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness Plus, Beats and more LA is home to many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts and we will continue to support our teams and the local community. Now turning to the quarter. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, up 4% from a year ago, and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see momentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among others. In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record, and in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business. I'm also pleased to announce that we reached a new record for our installed base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now users can discover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use writing tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with clean up. We introduced visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings. Users can also seamlessly access chat GPT across iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international expansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence even further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India. And we'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable Siri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple Intelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like Private Cloud Compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud. Apple Intelligence opens up an exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative tools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching all-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions. Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and Apple Intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in battery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays and a pro camera system so advanced it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher year-over-year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup. The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launchpad to enable users to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of chips to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the super portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly capable, but is our first carbon neutral Mac. All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple Silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers, who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad from the ultra-portal iPad Mini, built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users whenever they need it and wherever they go and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup. Wearables home and accessories revenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect companion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year. From the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an ever-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips and watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to continuing to advance this work, because we know how much it matters to our users. We've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2, and new sleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. During the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are enjoying incredible immersive entertainment experiences and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display. Vision Pro is also supercharging the creative process and the incredibly talented director John M. Chu recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie Wicked to life. Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan. Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible storytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season of Severance earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like The Studio and Your Friends and Neighbors. And we can't wait for the premiere of Formula 1 starring Brad Pitt on June 27, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that Apple TV+ continues to draw attention and accolades. To-date, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the quarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My Service that can help our users when they lose their luggage. For the first time, if you put an air tag in your suitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines, so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our teams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season. We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain, and the U.S. and we were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE and bringing our online store to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning in 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members. There's an incredible energy and passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I recently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father was an AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment. Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. And there are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing health feature like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren. These are the kind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and potential. We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good and putting all of our energy and ingenuity into making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.\nKevan Parekh: Thanks Tim, and good afternoon everyone. I'm going to cover the results for the first quarter of our fiscal year. We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac. Thanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments and is now over 2.35 billion active devices. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We grew in every geographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high-end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix. Operating expenses of $15.4 billion landed at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 7% year-over-year. This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of the $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision. Now, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year. We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total in an average geographic segment. We also set an all-time record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Kantar during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 96% as measured by 451 research. Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year. We saw strength across our lineup from the new Mac Mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. This incredible performance was broad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple Silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw a double-digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the U.S. was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new iPad Mini and latest iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the U.S. based on the latest reports from 451 Research. Wearable's home and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4 and the latest hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2. On watch, although we face a difficult compare against the watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for watch in the U.S. was reported at 94%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Services continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services offerings, from new games on Apple Arcade to exciting new programming on Fitness Plus, and the continued expansion of features like Tap to Pay, now live in 20 markets. Turning to enterprise, we have seen businesses continue to expand their deployments of our products and services. Deutsche Bank launched its Mac as Choice program for the developers and also issued the latest MacBook Air as a standard computer for their entire mortgage lending division. And we're excited to see leading enterprises such as SAP leverage Apple Intelligence in the U.S., with features like writing tools, summarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences. We also see strong demand in our emerging markets. For example, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed 1,000 of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation. In Vision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise, with Cisco's new spatial meetings delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning. Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar is strengthened significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single-digits year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow low-double-digits year-over-year. When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025. With that, let's open to call the questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Kevin. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: Certainly, we will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Great guys, Thanks so much for taking my questions. Tim, in your prepared remarks, you had noted that iPhone 16 models are selling better in markets where Apple Intelligence is available? And I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment a bit and share any other details you believe could better help us understand how Apple Intelligence is really impacting iPhone demand and/or what features you find that users are using most often already? And then I just have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, Eric. Hi, it's Tim. The -- we did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. In terms of the features that people are using, they're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments from writing tools to image playground and Genmoji to visual intelligence and more. And so we see all of those being used. The cleanup is another one that is popular and people love seeing that one demoed in the stores as well. We only had 2, 2.5 weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of [18.2] (ph) and then only had the U.K. and the other English language countries for the 2.5 weeks. And so we've got just the early indications at the moment, but we were glad…\nErik Woodring: Okay, that's really helpful.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nErik Woodring: Okay, thank you for that, Tim. It's helpful. And then, you know, if we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently, if we set aside China Macro, which I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that that Apple faces, whether that's, you know, shifting preferences for Western technology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is, you know, not necessarily helping replacement cycles. Just maybe double clicking on, on what you think and what you're hearing in China as a regard as it relates to the iPhone. Thanks so much.\nTim Cook: Yes, sure. If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year-over-year. And over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And of course on the Apple intelligence side we have not rolled out in China and as we just talked about we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in. And of course, it's the most competitive market in the world. And so all of those things are true. In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced in very recently in January that did not affect the December quarter. There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was announced, I believe, on January 20. And it does cover the categories that we have products in from smartphones to tablets and PCs and smart watches up to a certain, a maximum price point. And so we do see fiscal stimulus occurring and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much, Tim. Good luck.\nTim Cook: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Eric. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. And, hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you who -- you knew this one was coming, but there's a perception that you're a big beneficiary of lower cost of compute and I was wondering if you could give your worldly perspective here on the DeepSeek situation and if you are going to, if you, if anything's happened to change your views in terms of a tailwind to margins and your ability to execute even due to the potential for cost to come down due to that development and probably what was going to happen anyway. But I'd love your perspective on that and then have a quick follow-up. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Sure. In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. And that's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well. As you know, we do things on the device, and we do things in the private cloud and which mimics from a architectural point of view the -- what happens on the device. And from a CapEx point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure and we continue to leverage a hybrid model, which I think continues to serve us well.\nBen Reitzes: Oh, great. All right. Thanks, Tim. And then, you know, just with regard to, you know, the iPhone trajectory, do you feel like, I guess, what is -- you obviously don't talk about new products and stuff like that, but do you feel that there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future? Or do you feel that the current lineup kind of it shows where you're going? I guess without pulling punches wondering if you, you thought you know in terms of the phone innovation if there's a lot more to come and you could see the kind of current market changing a bit over the next two to three years. Thanks.\nTim Cook: I think, Ben, I think there's a lot more to come and I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline. So I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes, thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I have two as well. First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone upgraders, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you would attribute this upgrade strength to? Has Apple Intelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yes, thank you for the question. If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The installed base hit a new all-time high as well. And if you look at the 16, compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is across now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15. And so I think you can conclude from that, that there are compelling reasons to upgrade. And in the markets where we had launched Apple Intelligence, they outperformed the markets that we did not. So lots…\nMichael Ng: Great, thank you, Tim. That's…\nTim Cook: Yes, lots of good color there.\nMichael Ng: Great, thank you, Tim. That's very clear. And then I had one about the iPad Pro and for the thinner version. I was just wondering if you could talk about that thin form factor for the iPad Pro. How did it help iPad sales overall and what did your kind of marketing consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor? Thank you.\nTim Cook: It's a good question. iPad overall grew 15% for the quarter and it was more driven by iPad Air and the entry level iPad than it was the top level iPad. But overall we could not be more pleased with the iPad category growing 15%. It's a great achievement for the quarter. And probably what is most important is that over half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the iPad. So that tells us that there's a good amount of customers there to attract.\nMichael Ng: Thank you very much, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon, everyone. I have two as well. Maybe to start with, you folks are seeing some very robust growth trends in emerging markets right now for Apple products? Can you just add a high level, just talk about the durability of growth that you see in emerging markets? And then do you think the summation of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or perhaps starting to grow fast enough that it can actually offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?\nTim Cook: We have great results in a number of emerging markets. And as you know from past calls, I'm particularly keen on India. India set a December quarter record during the quarter. And we're opening more stores there. We've announced that we're going to open four new stores there. We also, the iPhone was the top selling model in India for the quarter. And it's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the third largest for PCs and tablets and so there's a huge market and we are -- we have very modest share in these markets. And so I think there's lots of upside there. And that's just one of the emerging markets.\nKevan Parekh: Yes, maybe I'll add, Amit, that in emerging markets we're also seeing double-digit growth on the install base, both in total and for the iPhone as well. So that's also an encouraging sign.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you. And then, you know, just a question on gross margins for the March quarter. You folks are guiding gross margin is flattish on a sequential basis. Typically, I think it tends to be guided up a little bit, 50 basis points, so sequentially. Can we just touch on like, what are the offsets of the puts and takes you see here on gross margins? And Kevan, maybe you can just talked about its FX having an outsized impact in your margin profile as well in March?\nKevan Parekh: Yes, Amit, let me take that One. You know, as we mentioned in my remarks, we're guiding to 46.5% to 47.5%. So we think it's, you know, we're very pleased with that level of guidance. As you mentioned, there's always puts and takes. We do think there's going to be some FX headwinds, which we talked about, that's going to affect, you know, our revenue growth as well. You know, it'll have an impact here on the margin, a sequential impact on margins. But we think that's going to be offset by favorable costs and the relative mix of services. We also, as you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, especially on the product side, because Q1 is such a large quarter for a products business, we do have a loss of leverage. So there are some puts and takes, and I think we feel good about the range. We think it's a very, very strong guide for gross margin.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Tim, I want to follow-up on your comment about channel inventory in China. I was wondering if you could maybe address more broadly if channel inventory across your different product lines and regions? Do you feel they're elevated or out of range in any other regions? And given the clearing event that kind of happened in China, I guess in the quarter, should we think of a more normal progression quarter-on-quarter into the March quarter in China in particular, and I will follow.\nTim Cook: Yes, I don't want to project sales for the current quarter by region, but if you if you look at the channel inventory and look at iPhone in the aggregate, so on a worldwide basis we're very comfortable with our channel inventory position in the -- in China my point was that our channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that was over half of the reduction in the reported results. And so if you look, part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, that's very clear. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, thank you.\nWamsi Mohan: And then maybe as my follow-up, your services growth has been very strong and I know you've kind of been navigating some pretty challenging regulatory burdens on the business globally. So how should investors think about maybe either a top line or margin headwind that let's say you're currently absorbing in your results that could potentially maybe reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment? Thank you so much.\nKevan Parekh: Yes. So I think one, I just wanted to kind of reiterate the fact that, you know, our services business had an all-time record for December quarter of 14%. And that was a one strength that we saw across all geographic segments and also was very broad base across all of our services. So we have, as you know, a very broad services portfolio. And so we do see, you know, good momentum across the board. And as well, we continue to see increasing engagement across the customer base, across all of the service offerings, both transacting and paid accounts. We talked about reaching all-time highs, and we have over now 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services platform.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess for the first one, if I -- I mean, you had a great quarter on Macs and iPads both. And I'm just curious, in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double-digit growth that you saw in both the product lines, and more interest are also here, we are talking about Apple Intelligence sort of influencing volumes on iPhones, but any thoughts on sort of how -- what does that influence look like in terms of volumes for Macs, for example, where I think there's a lot of conversation on AI PCs, how you're thinking about the impact there? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at Mac, Mac was up 16% and on iPad, we were up 15%. The Mac was driven by the very strong uptake on our new products during the quarter and the continued success of the MacBook Air. And so as you know, we've launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac and a Mac Mini during the quarter. We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads. The silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads. And so I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And Tim, I'm going to use your earlier discussion about India as a strong emerging market to sort of ask you about the supply chain planning there in terms of how much of the supply chain planning there that you're doing is more of a reflection of the growth expectations from that market relative to in terms of diversification of the supply chain? And how should we sort of think about that strategy in terms of that particular country? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at the manufacturing we do there, we do manufacturing both for the domestic market, and we export. And so in -- our business needs a certain economies of scale for it to make sense to manufacture in country. And so that really means that we're going to be both a use for the domestic market and an export market.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, thanks.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great, thanks, guys, for taking my question. So maybe, Tim, this is for you. I'm trying to think about your commentary around Apple Intelligence being sort of a momentum driver for the iPhone business. But when I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter, if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the last couple of years, kind of, feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter last year? So how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years? And then second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, obviously, you've done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you think we sit in terms of, on the services side at least, where margins could go? It looks like the 75% margin has been incredibly successful quarter. But just trying to get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the intermediate term? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was, that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. And so that gives us -- it's a positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling reasons to upgrade. And the other thing I would say, that I think I mentioned earlier, is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and so that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family. And so I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April. And so it will be at the -- in our Q3 quarter. And I'll let Kevan take the gross margin question.\nDavid Vogt: Yes, great.\nKevan Parekh: Hi, David. How are you? So on the Services gross margin, I think maybe just stepping back a second. Services business in general in aggregate is accretive to the overall company margin. And one of the things, as an important reminder, is we've got a very broad services portfolio. And those businesses have very different margin profiles. And so I think, one, it's because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. And so one of the big factors that drive the Services gross margins and relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio. We also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud, that are actually growing. And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being accretive to margins as well. And so in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver that 75% margin at the services level. And I think our guidance takes into consideration what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint of 46.5% to 47.5%, which again, we think is a strong guide.\nDavid Vogt: Great, thanks, guys.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right, thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I also had two of them. One, the first one for Tim. You had very strong Mac growth, 16% year-over-year last quarter. Just wondering how much of that was driven by some of the Mac silicon innovation versus a replacement cycle for Macs?\nTim Cook: I don't know the answer to your question precisely, but I think it is a combination of these products are so compelling, the M4-based products are so compelling, that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level and it's driving switchers at a double-digit level. And so we're seeing both come out, and I think it's just because of the compelling products.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks for that, Tim. And then a follow-up for Kevan on the gross margin. I want to ask you on the product side. Last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to a year ago period. I'm kind of curious how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin? Or do you think with some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?\nKevan Parekh: Yes. Thanks, Krish, for the question. So on the product side, as you mentioned, we had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points, for the December quarter. That was really driven by, we talked about, favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume. I would say, in general, our gross margin on products is driven by a number of factors. One of them is the various product launches that we have. Different products do have different margin profiles. And so that mix does make a difference. And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mix is across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate towards our Pro products because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get into our best products, which have favorable gross margins. So we're continuing to see that trend, that impacted us in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. And then that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter, but we figured that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave, the 46.5% to 47.5%.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks very much. My first question is for Tim. I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption. I guess do you see this simply as a question of time i.e., to launch more markets and languages or increase the percentage of installed base devices that can support it? Or is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend towards AI? And based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream? Thanks.\nTim Cook: I do believe it will go mainstream. I'm getting feedback from people using different features today. And this is -- keep in mind that on the iPhone side of our business, you either have to have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 to use Apple Intelligence. And so the -- as that base grows, I think the usage will continue to grow. And I think -- I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features, you can't imagine not using them anymore. I know I get 100s of e-mails a day, and the summarization function is so important. So I think it's a combination of that. And of course, in April, we roll out a whole series of new languages that we had mentioned, and so the base grows further.\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thank you. And then, Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was really getting Apple to record margin levels and also maintaining very consistent pricing across the product range. But taking the current high levels of profitability as fairly stable, what observations might you share about price sensitivity of users and whether having a wider range of pricing across the products might unlocks potentially further market share gains or boost overall product growth?\nKevan Parekh: Yes, it's a good question. I think one, I don't think we're going to really depart from what served us pretty well to now. I mean we always take it into consideration, looking at short-term -- comparison between the short term and the long term. I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy, which would serve us pretty well. And I think we're going to continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell.\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thanks.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. How do you guys see the potential tariff impact to your product for consumer demand under Trump 2.0 you guys did find under Trump 1.0?\nTim Cook: We are monitoring the situation and don't have anything more to add than that.\nAtif Malik: Great. And Tim, as a follow-up, there is a lot of discussion on agentic AI, the use of agents. Do you guys see the upgraded series expected in April as something that will, let's say, be the killer application among the suite of features that you have announced in Apple Intelligence?\nTim Cook: I think the killer feature is different for different people. But I think for most, they're going to find that they're going to use many of the features every day. And certainly, one of those is the -- is Siri, and that will be coming over the next several months.\nAtif Malik: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Atif. Operator, could we please get the last question?\nOperator: Our last question is from Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.\nBen Bollin: Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I'm interested in your thoughts and how you would have us think about the average useful life of these devices in the wild. And in particular, curious, if you look at the strength you saw in fiscal ‘21 and how that might support accelerated refresh opportunity into the future?\nTim Cook: Yes. Ben, I think it's different for different types of users. I mean you have very early adopter kind of users that are very quick to jump on the latest technology that upgrade very frequently. And then you have people that are on the entire opposite side of that barbell. And most people are between those two points. And so I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the COVID period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company to -- for more than one of the product categories.\nBen Bollin: That’s it from me. Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Ben.

For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Additionally, today's discussion will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record and up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and Services set an all-time revenue record, up 12% year-over-year. We also set September quarter segment revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the Rest of Asia Pacific, as well as in a large number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, the UK, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And we continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at Apple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February, which brings users tomorrow's technology today. And in June, we announced Apple Intelligence, a remarkable personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our groundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with Private Cloud Compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, with systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. And we look forward to additional intelligence features in December, with even more powerful Writing Tools, a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration, as well as localized English in several countries, including the UK, Australia, and Canada. These features have already been provided to developers and we're getting great feedback. More features will be rolling out in the coming months, as well as support for more languages, and this is just the beginning. Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenues set a September quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're beginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16, powered by A18, is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera, fantastic photo experiences, and the addition of the action button and camera control. An iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even larger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system with camera control, and studio quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life. Turning to Mac, revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple Silicon to Mac, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. From blazing fast performance to Apple's most advanced neural engine yet, our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows, and they ensure our newest Macs will be the best personal computers for AI the instant they hit stores. With the newest additions to our Mac lineup, customers can choose the Mac that's just right for them, whether that's iMac, the world's best and most beautiful all-in-one; MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop now with double the starting memory; MacBook Pro, the best Pro notebook anywhere; or the incredible, mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac. iPad revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher year-over-year. iPad is unlike any other product on the market today, and it's become an essential device in homes, schools, and businesses of all sizes. Recently, we were thrilled to introduce the newest iPad mini, featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. It's been a big year for iPad. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers as they got back to school this year, while creators are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the M4-powered iPad Pro. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched the all-new Apple Watch Series 10, bringing a beautiful new design and new capabilities to the world's most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. It's the thinnest Apple Watch yet, making it more comfortable than ever, while offering the biggest, most advanced display. watchOS 11 brings some huge new health and fitness insights to users, including sleep apnea notifications, which help to alert people with a potentially serious but often undiagnosed condition. We're proud of the impact we make through our health innovations on watch, and I'm grateful for every note I receive about the importance of watch in people's lives. With AirPods 4, we broke a new ground in comfort and design with our best-ever open-ear headphones available for the first time with active noise cancellation. And we were especially pleased to unveil revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with hearing protection, hearing test, and hearing aid features. These just became available in a software update this week, and we believe this will make a meaningful difference in our users' lives. I've already started getting notes from customers calling the experience life changing. And Apple Vision Pro continues to deliver spatial experiences that weren't possible before, including immersive entertainment like the new short film, Submerged, which gives people a view into the unique storytelling power made possible by spatial computing. Vision Pro has more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS 2, as well as applications companies are building to reimagine how they work. Vision Pro continues to inspire awe in its users, and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible. And just yesterday, we announced we're bringing Vision Pro to Korea and the UAE. As I mentioned earlier, Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $25 billion, up 12% from a year ago, and with all-time revenue records across most of our categories. With Apple TV+, we love celebrating the craft of great storytellers who know how to put on a show. Audiences love to discover new movies like Wolfs, explore acclaimed new series like Disclaimer, and dive back into returning favorites like Slow Horses and Shrinking. Apple TV+ productions have become fixtures at award shows, earning more than 2,300 nominations and more than 500 wins today. Apple also offers a live sports experience in a league of its own with MLS Season Pass, and subscribers have been cheering on their favorite teams in the MLS Cup playoffs. This month, we also marked 10 years of Apple Pay. There's always something magical about being able to buy groceries or pay for movie tickets seamlessly with your Apple device. Today, users choose Apple Pay for purchases across tens of millions of retailers worldwide. And we're excited to make the Apple Pay experience even better, with the option to redeem rewards and access loans from credit cards, debit cards, and other lenders right at checkout. Whenever we celebrate big moments, Apple Stores are the best places to share them with customers. I had an incredible time during launch day in September alongside our team at Apple Fifth Avenue, where energy and enthusiasm filled the air. And in stores all over the world, customers are eager to get a closer look at our latest innovations. We also opened two new stores during the quarter and we can't wait to bring four new stores to customers in India. We're passionate about education and believe technology has a vital role to play in both helping teachers to inspire their students and students to learn about the world around them. In honor of World Teachers' Day, Apple was proud to share new resources for teachers to engage their students in ways that aim to make learning easy and fun. Additionally, we've expanded our education grant program into 100 new schools and communities, helping with everything from access to technology, to educator resources, to scholarships and financial support. As we near the end of the year, we're proud of the progress we've made in our efforts to be carbon-neutral across our entire footprint by the end of the decade. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to introduce our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac with the latest Mac mini. And in another milestone, customers can choose a carbon-neutral option of any Apple Watch. These achievements are amazing for all of us at Apple, and we are determined to reach our 2030 goal. At Apple, across everything we do, we manage for the long term, because we're always thinking about what comes next, the next great challenge, the next innovative idea, the next big breakthrough. As we close out the year, we have the best lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season, including Apple Intelligence, which marks the start of a new chapter for our products. This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. Before I hand it over to Luca, with Luca transitioning to a new role with Apple, this will be the final time he's joining our call. So, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize his extraordinary service as Apple's CFO and to thank him for his partnership. I am deeply grateful. In his 10 years in the role, Luca has done truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we know it today. He has helped manage Apple for the long term, thoughtfully and deliberately. He has helped us enrich the lives of so many around the world, and he has been a leader that people look up to and have learned so much from. I have incredible confidence in our incoming CFO, Kevan Parekh, and we look forward to more of you meeting and working with him going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you, Tim, for the very kind words. Serving as Apple's CFO has been a real privilege and an amazing journey, and I've greatly appreciated the support from our investors and the analyst community over the years. Kevan is exceptional, and I know you will enjoy interacting with him going forward. Let me now turn to the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We're very pleased to report a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We grew in the vast majority of the markets we track and achieved September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $70 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength around the world, reaching all-time records in both developed and emerging markets with double-digit growth and record results across most services categories. Company gross margin was 46.2%, near the high end of our guidance range. Products gross margin was 36.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 74%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and up 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, which relates to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court's State Aid decision. When we exclude this one-time charge, net income was $25 billion and diluted earnings per share were a $1.64, up 12% year-over-year, and a September quarter record. Operating cash flow was very strong at $26.8 billion, a new September quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and a September quarter record in total and across several markets, including the US, the Middle East, Korea, and South Asia. The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, Urban China, the UK, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 family, with 451 Research recently measuring it at 98% in the US. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in MacBook Air. Customers have been loving the performance of Apple Silicon on Mac and we are very excited to bring the latest M4 family of chips to the lineup. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with about half of customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And in the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 95% in the US. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, up 8% year-over-year. In addition to growth in developed markets, we also saw strong performance in many emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East, India and South Asia. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, down 3% year-over-year. The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for watch in the US. Our Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. Services continue to see strong momentum with the growth of our installed base of active devices setting a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number we had only four years ago. And as always, we remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services from new games on Apple Arcade to new features like Tap to Cash and pay with installments using Apple Pay to many successful new and returning shows on Apple TV+. This past quarter, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of Apple Card, which was ranked #1 in customer satisfaction among co-branded credit cards by J.D. Power for the fourth year in a row. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see strong demand across our products and services. NVIDIA launched its Mac as a choice program supported by AppleCare for Enterprise and Apple Professional Services with over 10,000 Macs deployed worldwide. And Novartis, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recently chose iPhone 16 as the standard mobile device for all employees. We also see continued momentum with Apple Vision Pro in the enterprise space. UC San Diego Health is the first hospital in the world to test spatial computing apps on Apple Vision Pro in clinical trials for patient surgery in the operating room. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $157 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.6 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $7 billion, leaving us with total debt of $107 billion. As a result, net cash was $50 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $29 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect Services revenue to grow double-digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2024. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments. And our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on November 14, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2024. With that, let us open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. I just have two. The first one is for Tim on Apple Intelligence. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on some of the early feedback to Apple Intelligence both for iOS 18.1, but also the developer beta so far, and whether you would attribute Apple Intelligence to any of the strong iPhone performance that we've seen to date. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Michael. As I noted in my comments, just this week on Monday, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This includes things like systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural conversational Siri, more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies, simply by typing a description, which is really cool, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. And in fact, if you just look at the first three days, which is all we have obviously from Monday, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the year-ago quarter. And so, there's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence. Carrying on in the quarter, we are looking forward to bringing even more features in December, and this will include even more powerful Writing Tools and visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration in addition to other features, as well as we'll bring localized English to several countries that include the UK, Australia, and Canada. So, it's going to be quite a software quarter between the release on Monday and the release in December. And then, as we turn the corner to '25, we'll have more languages rolling out, starting in April as well and more features as well. And so, it's a very strong drumbeat, and we couldn't be more excited about it.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you very much. And my second one just for Luca. First, congratulations again, Luca, on the new role and it's been a real privilege being able to spend some time with you. A question that I think will overlap with your new role as well. Could you just talk a little bit about the CapEx outlook and whether investments in things like Private Cloud Compute could change the historical CapEx range of roughly $10 billion a year? Thank you very much.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Michael. On the CapEx front, I've mentioned before a number of times, we have a bit of a hybrid model in the way we run our data centers. In some cases, we use our own data centers. In some cases, we use, third-party providers. So, our CapEx numbers may not be fully comparable with others. But, obviously, we are rolling out these features, Apple Intelligence features already now, and so we are making all the capacity that is needed available for these features. You will see in our 10-K the amount of CapEx that we've incurred during the course of fiscal '24, and we will -- in fiscal '25, we will continue to make all the investments that are necessary, and of course, the investments in AI-related CapEx will be made.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Luca.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply. As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years. And if so, what you've learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down and being more price sensitive? And overall, any impact that Apple Intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: There's a lot there. On Apple Intelligence, we believe it's a compelling upgrade reason. And we'll -- but we just launched it three days ago and so what we've got now from a data point point of view is the number I just referenced that 18.1 has twice the adoption rate of 17.1. So, that clearly shows a level of interest out there. In terms of exiting the December quarter with demand greater than supply, that's not my recollection that, that happened for all four of the years. We clearly had cases during COVID where there were disruptions and that's the some spilled over, but in a more regular environment where we're not having something, a 100-year flood kind of thing, we would -- our desire is to get into balance as quickly as possible. We don't want customers having to wait for products. And so, if you look at how we've done this year, we did that very quickly on the 16, on the 16 Pro family, the Pro and the Pro Max, we've been constrained in October, but we believe that soon we'll be out of constraint. And so, that's a good sign from our point of view. Keep in mind that, that's a function of supply and demand, not one side or the other. And we've been preparing for the quarter for a while. So that's what I would say there.\nErik Woodring: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah, thank you.\nErik Woodring: And then, Luca, if I just turn to you, obviously, it's been a pleasure working with you, and we wish you all the best in the next role. There's plenty of debate in the market right now about input costs and commodity prices, and the impact that will have on gross margins. Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis points sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So, can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly whether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be, or whether that should become a headwind as we look forward? Thanks so much.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Erik. As you know, our gross margins are a factor of many, many variables. Commodities, of course, are important. They're not the only factor. But specifically on commodities, I can tell you that both for the September quarter and what we expect for the December quarter, most commodities are going to move down in price, while NAND and DRAM increased during the course of the September quarter and we expect them to increase during the December quarter. We are very pleased with the level of gross margins that we've reported during the course of the year. The entire fiscal year of '24, they're really, for our company, record levels of gross margin, and obviously guiding to 46% to 47% for the December quarter with all the new technologies that we've included in the products, with all the new features that Tim has talked about, a lot of new products across the board, I think it's a very good sign.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much, Luca.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes from Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. And I'll echo those comments about Luca. Miss you, and good luck. And my question is with regard to iPhone again, and with regard to the fourth quarter, is my first question -- or sorry, the fourth calendar quarter, your first quarter. When you look at mid- to low-single-digit revenue growth, do you expect the iPhone to grow faster? And what are you thinking about in the answer to that question with regard to China, which keeps improving each quarter? Thanks very much. And then, I have just a follow-up. Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Ben, we are not providing that level of color today. Yes, we've said that we expect total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits. Keep in mind, Apple Intelligence, as Tim said, is rolling out over time, both features and languages. And we just had a number of exciting launches just this week from the Apple Intelligence feature to the new Mac. So, we leave it at that. We've given you the total for the company and some pretty good direction on Services, which we expect to continue to grow at a similar rate than what we've seen in fiscal '24.\nBen Reitzes: Great. Thanks, Luca. Hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you, I mean, you guys are well aware a lot of the noise out there, people chattering about builds, lead times, and you guys are guiding for mid- to low-single-digit growth. That certainly doesn't sound like alarm bells here, vis-a-vis what you guys must be hearing. And I know you guys are just running your business and doing the best you can, but you have a lot of perspective now, Tim. What are people missing here? And it certainly just sounds like -- you guys are typically conservative. That guide for revenue is certainly sounds like [this guy is certainly not falling] (ph), and you have a pretty good product cycle. So, what do you think people are missing and what are you excited about? Thanks so much, Tim.\nTim Cook: Ben, I could not be more excited about Apple Intelligence and the rollout that we've got in front of us. I'm on the -- I'm obviously on future releases as well, working on it and it's changing my daily life. I'm super excited about the health features that we're rolling out. If the number of emails I'm already getting from customers that have taken a hearing test and are using their AirPods Pro 2 as a hearing aid, are just -- are staggering and heartwarming to read. I'm also thrilled about sleep apnea and the notification there that we'll have through the watch. This week is a very exciting week for us because we just rolled out three days -- three launches of different, Macs and desktops and laptops. And so, we have a lot of things on the docket and it's definitely the strongest lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season. In terms of the noise, I tune it out, because if not, it would just be, deafening. And so that that's what I do, I can't speak for everybody else, but that's what I do.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim. Appreciate it.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Ben.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two as well. And Luca, best of luck in the future. It's been a pleasure working with you. I guess the first one I have is, away from iPhones, on the Services side, you're adding $100 billion run rate with Services today, which is a phenomenal achievement by itself. As you look at the Services portfolio today, can you just talk about how much of this business do you think is reoccurring versus transactional? And are the growth rates different between the subscription portfolio over here versus transactional portfolio?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit, I'll take this one. Yes, we are, first of all, very, very happy with -- it's an important milestone. Of course, we've got to a run rate of $100 billion. You look back just a few years ago, and the growth has been phenomenal. We're very pleased. We've got a very diversified portfolio of services. And over the years, the amount that is recurring in nature has grown and is growing faster than the transactional piece. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions on our platform right now between our own services and third-party services. That continues to grow strong double-digits. So, we feel very, very good. And, essentially, to your question, yes, the recurring portion is growing faster than the transactional one.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. If I can just follow-up, if I look at the growth rates across the different geographies, there's always concern around China when it comes to iPhone demand, I feel, but the performance in September looks fairly good. I wonder if you just touch on, what are you seeing from a demand perspective in China? If the recent stimulus plan in China could essentially be a catalyst for iPhone? And then, EMEA really stood out with double-digit growth. Maybe you can just flush that out as well for us. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah, I'll take the China question. If you look at how we did for the quarter, we were relatively flat year-over-year. And a key component of that improvement relative to the year-over-year performance that we had been achieving is that there was a sequential improvement in foreign exchange. And so that helped us out. As you know, it's been a headwind that we've been reporting for a period of time. And -- but the other parts that are -- what else is going on there is that our installed base of the active devices reached an all-time high. We had the top two selling, smartphones in Urban China according to Kantar. The level of new customers that we have buying the products like Mac and iPad are well over 50%. Watch is over three quarters that are new to the product. And so, there's several positive signs there. In terms of the stimulus, it's a clear focus of the team there, but I'm not an economist and don't want to ad lib on the effect of it.\nLuca Maestri: On the Europe side, Amit, a number of things. As you see from our results during the quarter, Europe grew double-digits, 11%, and really, it was really good growth across the board, the different segments. They all did well. Keep in mind, our definition of Europe in our segment reporting includes a number of emerging markets, like Turkey, where we've grown very strongly, the Middle East. Tim mentioned a number of records in Saudi, in UAE, and we also include India where we set an all-time revenue record during the September quarter. But I have to say also Western Europe grew nicely. So, we've seen very good results for us in the entire segment.\nAmit Daryanani: Great. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks everyone for taking my question, and congratulations, Luca. I know Luca, and I know Tim, you don't want to give a lot of granularity, but if I just try to pull together your comments about what the demand environment looks like, are we to assume based on sort of the commentary that there is a risk that maybe the product revenue portfolio could be down in the December quarter if I take your numbers at face value? And if that's the risk, is that more iPhone-related, Mac-related, given the strength that you've seen in iPad related? Just trying to get a handle on kind of what potentially is giving you that degree of, I don't want to say caution, but maybe balanced for you going into the December quarter. And then, I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: As I said, David, we're not providing that level of color. We're giving you some data on services. I would repeat what I said earlier. We're very early in the cycle, very early in the cycle with a lot of new products and features that that we are launching. And we're very excited about them, but it's early. And the Apple Intelligence rollout is going to happen over time, not across the world as normally we do with software releases.\nDavid Vogt: Right. Okay. So maybe a follow-up for, Tim. When you think about to Luca's point about the rollout being staged over the next several quarters across the world, do you think that has any impact on sort of the normal historical demand cadence across different regions? So, should we see something different, let's say, in the December quarter, the March quarter, the June quarter, et cetera, relative to history, given the timing of the rollout and where customers are probably waiting for the devices to be enabled to have the operating system? Would just love to kind of get your perspective on how we think about the demand cadence, how it might be different than maybe historically? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah, David. It's clearly, as you point out, a different cadence, if you will, than we would normally do. As we talked about at WWDC, we wanted to give a comprehensive vision of Apple Intelligence, and we said then that it would rollout over time. And we're right on the, what we said, at WWDC, and so we're executing well. In terms of the demand curve, I would just say that what we believe here is that it's a compelling reason for upgrading. And, it's -- that's both my personal experience and feedback that I'm getting and so we'll see. We're not projecting, beyond the current quarter obviously. We just don't do that.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, Tim, and best of luck, Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Luca, we will miss you on these calls. Tim, maybe for you, as you think about this staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence, can you help us think through potentially how much of the global installed base of phones will have access to Apple Intelligence in their native language, in their region within the next year or maybe in the next two years? And what are some of the gating factors in the rollout? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: If you look at our schedule, we started in the -- with US English, that started on Monday. There's another release coming that adds additional features that I had referenced in December in not only US English but also localized for UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. And then, we will add more languages in April. We haven't set the specifics yet in terms of the languages, but we'll add more in April and then more as we step through the year. And so, we're moving just as fast as possible while ensuring quality. That's what we're doing.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nWamsi Mohan: And then, as a follow-up, maybe this is a little premature, but how is Apple at a high level prepared to potentially deal with any tariffs that might come post the selection cycle? And if not exactly how, perhaps you can just help investors think about some of the things Apple has done already to try to insulate from some of these impacts, potential impacts?\nTim Cook: I wouldn't want to speculate about those sorts of things. And so, I'm going to punt on that one.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Wamsi. May we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. And again, thanks Luca for all your help with analyts and investors. My first question is on R&D. Given how much your tech peers are spending on AI, does this new era of Apple Intelligence actually require Apple to invest more in R&D beyond your current 7% to 8% of sales to capture this opportunity? And then, I had a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Krish, as you know, we've been investing heavily in R&D over the last several years. Our R&D growth has been significant during the last several years. And obviously, as we move through the course of fiscal '24, we've also reallocated some of the existing resources to this new technology to AI. And so, the level of intensity that we're putting into AI has increased a lot, and you maybe don't see the full extent of it because we've also had some internal reallocation of the base of engineering resources that we have within the company.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks for that, Luca. And then, another quick follow-up. I understand Apple Intelligence is a feature on the phone today, but do you think that, in the future, it could potentially have or benefit the services growth business, or is that too -- are these too bifurcated to even make a call on the [indiscernible]? Thank you.\nTim Cook: I think, just to keep it in mind, Apple Intelligence is also available on the Mac for the M-series products and on certain models of iPad, and in addition to the phone. And so, it's on all three. You're quite -- what was your follow-on question?\nKrish Sankar: Tim, it does on -- can the Apple Intelligence actually help the Services growth rate?\nTim Cook: Keep in mind that we were have released a lot of APIs and developers will be taking advantage of those APIs. That release has occurred as well and of course more are coming. And so I, definitely believe that a lot of developers will be taking advantage of Apple Intelligence in a big way. And what that does to Services, I'll not forecast, but I would say that from an ecosystem point of view, I think it will be great for the user and the user experience.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Krish. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. And Luca, congrats on the new role and pleasure working with you these years. I guess, if I could, for my first one, start with mix on the iPhone side? And what I'm really curious about if you have any thoughts given that Apple Intelligence is now going to be a consistent feature set across all the four sort of iPhones on the iPhone 16 series that you launched and going back to iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Are you seeing any change in behavior from a consumer perspective in terms of which sort of on the mix front within the iPhone series where consumer adoption is given that there's more consistency of the features when it comes to Apple Intelligence across the board? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: It's tough to answer your question, because we've been constrained in October on the Pro and the Pro Max. And so, it's really too early in the curve to call the precise mix on the consumer versus the Pro. So, we'll see.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And for my follow-up, Tim, during the quarter I think over the last 90 days, we had the quotes come out in relation to the DOJ relative to the Google sort of revenue sharing agreement that you have with them. How do you sort of look at it going forward in terms of emphasizing the role that Apple has in that ecosystem with Safari and sort of the potential outcomes that you're looking at? Thank you.\nTim Cook: I don't want to speculate on that from a legal point of view. It's an ongoing case, and I will save that for another day.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Samik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks very much. My first one, Tim, I'd like to ask about some of the components in Services where despite your installed base, some parts of the Apple One bundle, like Music and News and Arcade and Fitness, are not obviously the market-leading offerings. And maybe what might change that and what other services could you call out as growing faster, having wider -- widening addressable markets like we've seen in pay or advertising?\nTim Cook: The way that I view it is that we have lots of opportunity in all of those. And so, there's lots of customers to try to convince to take advantage of it, and we're going to continue investing in the Services and adding new features and -- whether it's News+ or Music or Arcade, that's what we're going to do. Keep in mind that for us, we're more focused on being best than being most. And so, in some cases, not in every case, some of the services that you -- the majority of the services that you mentioned are not cross platform. We make them for our customers only and so that in some cases changes the person who's going to sell the most perhaps, but that's -- our objective is to make the best.\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thanks. And then, Luca, one piece of unfinished business was your pledge to get to a net-neutral cash position. And over the last two years, you stayed around $50 billion of net cash. We've clearly seen instances in the past where elevated marketing spend or other programs brought increases in market share. I guess my question looking back on your tenure is, at your scale now of $57 billion of OpEx, do you still see incremental ways to put that cash to work in the business? Or will we just continue to see increased shareholder returns?\nLuca Maestri: Well, obviously, as you've seen, our OpEx has gone up over the years. We've also seen at the same time a significant expansion in gross margin, maybe to a level that I would have not expected a few years ago, but we've done a very good job on a number of fronts. And so, I would say we -- when we plan -- every time we plan for the upcoming year, we think about all the different areas where we can deploy our resources and we make them available to grow the business. I think we've done very well over the long term and -- but our fundamental philosophy is to look after the business first. And then, if we have excess cash, we will continue to return it to our shareholders and the plan has worked quite well so far.\nRichard Kramer: Okay. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. We'll take our last question, please, operator?\nOperator: Our last question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Thank you for squeezing me in. It seems to us that the spec differentiation between iPhone 16 Pro and base model isn't as big as prior years. All iPhones have new A18, A18 Pro chips and there wasn't an increase in ASPs versus last year. Can you share with us if there is a shift in your strategy in terms of...\nOperator: Unfortunately, Mr. Malik's line has dropped.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Sorry, Atif. We'll connect offline. Thank you, everybody. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

      "transcript": "Suhasini Chandramouli: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q4 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and CFO, Luca Maestri, and they'll be joined by Kevan Parekh, Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Additionally, today's discussion will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record and up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and Services set an all-time revenue record, up 12% year-over-year. We also set September quarter segment revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the Rest of Asia Pacific, as well as in a large number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, the UK, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And we continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at Apple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February, which brings users tomorrow's technology today. And in June, we announced Apple Intelligence, a remarkable personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our groundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with Private Cloud Compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, with systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. And we look forward to additional intelligence features in December, with even more powerful Writing Tools, a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration, as well as localized English in several countries, including the UK, Australia, and Canada. These features have already been provided to developers and we're getting great feedback. More features will be rolling out in the coming months, as well as support for more languages, and this is just the beginning. Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenues set a September quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're beginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16, powered by A18, is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera, fantastic photo experiences, and the addition of the action button and camera control. An iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even larger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system with camera control, and studio quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life. Turning to Mac, revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple Silicon to Mac, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. From blazing fast performance to Apple's most advanced neural engine yet, our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows, and they ensure our newest Macs will be the best personal computers for AI the instant they hit stores. With the newest additions to our Mac lineup, customers can choose the Mac that's just right for them, whether that's iMac, the world's best and most beautiful all-in-one; MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop now with double the starting memory; MacBook Pro, the best Pro notebook anywhere; or the incredible, mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac. iPad revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher year-over-year. iPad is unlike any other product on the market today, and it's become an essential device in homes, schools, and businesses of all sizes. Recently, we were thrilled to introduce the newest iPad mini, featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. It's been a big year for iPad. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers as they got back to school this year, while creators are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the M4-powered iPad Pro. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched the all-new Apple Watch Series 10, bringing a beautiful new design and new capabilities to the world's most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. It's the thinnest Apple Watch yet, making it more comfortable than ever, while offering the biggest, most advanced display. watchOS 11 brings some huge new health and fitness insights to users, including sleep apnea notifications, which help to alert people with a potentially serious but often undiagnosed condition. We're proud of the impact we make through our health innovations on watch, and I'm grateful for every note I receive about the importance of watch in people's lives. With AirPods 4, we broke a new ground in comfort and design with our best-ever open-ear headphones available for the first time with active noise cancellation. And we were especially pleased to unveil revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with hearing protection, hearing test, and hearing aid features. These just became available in a software update this week, and we believe this will make a meaningful difference in our users' lives. I've already started getting notes from customers calling the experience life changing. And Apple Vision Pro continues to deliver spatial experiences that weren't possible before, including immersive entertainment like the new short film, Submerged, which gives people a view into the unique storytelling power made possible by spatial computing. Vision Pro has more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS 2, as well as applications companies are building to reimagine how they work. Vision Pro continues to inspire awe in its users, and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible. And just yesterday, we announced we're bringing Vision Pro to Korea and the UAE. As I mentioned earlier, Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $25 billion, up 12% from a year ago, and with all-time revenue records across most of our categories. With Apple TV+, we love celebrating the craft of great storytellers who know how to put on a show. Audiences love to discover new movies like Wolfs, explore acclaimed new series like Disclaimer, and dive back into returning favorites like Slow Horses and Shrinking. Apple TV+ productions have become fixtures at award shows, earning more than 2,300 nominations and more than 500 wins today. Apple also offers a live sports experience in a league of its own with MLS Season Pass, and subscribers have been cheering on their favorite teams in the MLS Cup playoffs. This month, we also marked 10 years of Apple Pay. There's always something magical about being able to buy groceries or pay for movie tickets seamlessly with your Apple device. Today, users choose Apple Pay for purchases across tens of millions of retailers worldwide. And we're excited to make the Apple Pay experience even better, with the option to redeem rewards and access loans from credit cards, debit cards, and other lenders right at checkout. Whenever we celebrate big moments, Apple Stores are the best places to share them with customers. I had an incredible time during launch day in September alongside our team at Apple Fifth Avenue, where energy and enthusiasm filled the air. And in stores all over the world, customers are eager to get a closer look at our latest innovations. We also opened two new stores during the quarter and we can't wait to bring four new stores to customers in India. We're passionate about education and believe technology has a vital role to play in both helping teachers to inspire their students and students to learn about the world around them. In honor of World Teachers' Day, Apple was proud to share new resources for teachers to engage their students in ways that aim to make learning easy and fun. Additionally, we've expanded our education grant program into 100 new schools and communities, helping with everything from access to technology, to educator resources, to scholarships and financial support. As we near the end of the year, we're proud of the progress we've made in our efforts to be carbon-neutral across our entire footprint by the end of the decade. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to introduce our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac with the latest Mac mini. And in another milestone, customers can choose a carbon-neutral option of any Apple Watch. These achievements are amazing for all of us at Apple, and we are determined to reach our 2030 goal. At Apple, across everything we do, we manage for the long term, because we're always thinking about what comes next, the next great challenge, the next innovative idea, the next big breakthrough. As we close out the year, we have the best lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season, including Apple Intelligence, which marks the start of a new chapter for our products. This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. Before I hand it over to Luca, with Luca transitioning to a new role with Apple, this will be the final time he's joining our call. So, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize his extraordinary service as Apple's CFO and to thank him for his partnership. I am deeply grateful. In his 10 years in the role, Luca has done truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we know it today. He has helped manage Apple for the long term, thoughtfully and deliberately. He has helped us enrich the lives of so many around the world, and he has been a leader that people look up to and have learned so much from. I have incredible confidence in our incoming CFO, Kevan Parekh, and we look forward to more of you meeting and working with him going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you, Tim, for the very kind words. Serving as Apple's CFO has been a real privilege and an amazing journey, and I've greatly appreciated the support from our investors and the analyst community over the years. Kevan is exceptional, and I know you will enjoy interacting with him going forward. Let me now turn to the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We're very pleased to report a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We grew in the vast majority of the markets we track and achieved September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $70 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength around the world, reaching all-time records in both developed and emerging markets with double-digit growth and record results across most services categories. Company gross margin was 46.2%, near the high end of our guidance range. Products gross margin was 36.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 74%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and up 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, which relates to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court's State Aid decision. When we exclude this one-time charge, net income was $25 billion and diluted earnings per share were a $1.64, up 12% year-over-year, and a September quarter record. Operating cash flow was very strong at $26.8 billion, a new September quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and a September quarter record in total and across several markets, including the US, the Middle East, Korea, and South Asia. The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, Urban China, the UK, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 family, with 451 Research recently measuring it at 98% in the US. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in MacBook Air. Customers have been loving the performance of Apple Silicon on Mac and we are very excited to bring the latest M4 family of chips to the lineup. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with about half of customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And in the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 95% in the US. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, up 8% year-over-year. In addition to growth in developed markets, we also saw strong performance in many emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East, India and South Asia. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, down 3% year-over-year. The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for watch in the US. Our Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. Services continue to see strong momentum with the growth of our installed base of active devices setting a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number we had only four years ago. And as always, we remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services from new games on Apple Arcade to new features like Tap to Cash and pay with installments using Apple Pay to many successful new and returning shows on Apple TV+. This past quarter, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of Apple Card, which was ranked #1 in customer satisfaction among co-branded credit cards by J.D. Power for the fourth year in a row. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see strong demand across our products and services. NVIDIA launched its Mac as a choice program supported by AppleCare for Enterprise and Apple Professional Services with over 10,000 Macs deployed worldwide. And Novartis, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recently chose iPhone 16 as the standard mobile device for all employees. We also see continued momentum with Apple Vision Pro in the enterprise space. UC San Diego Health is the first hospital in the world to test spatial computing apps on Apple Vision Pro in clinical trials for patient surgery in the operating room. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $157 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.6 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $7 billion, leaving us with total debt of $107 billion. As a result, net cash was $50 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $29 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect Services revenue to grow double-digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2024. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments. And our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on November 14, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2024. With that, let us open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. I just have two. The first one is for Tim on Apple Intelligence. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on some of the early feedback to Apple Intelligence both for iOS 18.1, but also the developer beta so far, and whether you would attribute Apple Intelligence to any of the strong iPhone performance that we've seen to date. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Michael. As I noted in my comments, just this week on Monday, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This includes things like systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural conversational Siri, more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies, simply by typing a description, which is really cool, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. And in fact, if you just look at the first three days, which is all we have obviously from Monday, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the year-ago quarter. And so, there's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence. Carrying on in the quarter, we are looking forward to bringing even more features in December, and this will include even more powerful Writing Tools and visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration in addition to other features, as well as we'll bring localized English to several countries that include the UK, Australia, and Canada. So, it's going to be quite a software quarter between the release on Monday and the release in December. And then, as we turn the corner to '25, we'll have more languages rolling out, starting in April as well and more features as well. And so, it's a very strong drumbeat, and we couldn't be more excited about it.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you very much. And my second one just for Luca. First, congratulations again, Luca, on the new role and it's been a real privilege being able to spend some time with you. A question that I think will overlap with your new role as well. Could you just talk a little bit about the CapEx outlook and whether investments in things like Private Cloud Compute could change the historical CapEx range of roughly $10 billion a year? Thank you very much.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Michael. On the CapEx front, I've mentioned before a number of times, we have a bit of a hybrid model in the way we run our data centers. In some cases, we use our own data centers. In some cases, we use, third-party providers. So, our CapEx numbers may not be fully comparable with others. But, obviously, we are rolling out these features, Apple Intelligence features already now, and so we are making all the capacity that is needed available for these features. You will see in our 10-K the amount of CapEx that we've incurred during the course of fiscal '24, and we will -- in fiscal '25, we will continue to make all the investments that are necessary, and of course, the investments in AI-related CapEx will be made.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Luca.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply. As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years. And if so, what you've learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down and being more price sensitive? And overall, any impact that Apple Intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: There's a lot there. On Apple Intelligence, we believe it's a compelling upgrade reason. And we'll -- but we just launched it three days ago and so what we've got now from a data point point of view is the number I just referenced that 18.1 has twice the adoption rate of 17.1. So, that clearly shows a level of interest out there. In terms of exiting the December quarter with demand greater than supply, that's not my recollection that, that happened for all four of the years. We clearly had cases during COVID where there were disruptions and that's the some spilled over, but in a more regular environment where we're not having something, a 100-year flood kind of thing, we would -- our desire is to get into balance as quickly as possible. We don't want customers having to wait for products. And so, if you look at how we've done this year, we did that very quickly on the 16, on the 16 Pro family, the Pro and the Pro Max, we've been constrained in October, but we believe that soon we'll be out of constraint. And so, that's a good sign from our point of view. Keep in mind that, that's a function of supply and demand, not one side or the other. And we've been preparing for the quarter for a while. So that's what I would say there.\nErik Woodring: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah, thank you.\nErik Woodring: And then, Luca, if I just turn to you, obviously, it's been a pleasure working with you, and we wish you all the best in the next role. There's plenty of debate in the market right now about input costs and commodity prices, and the impact that will have on gross margins. Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis points sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So, can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly whether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be, or whether that should become a headwind as we look forward? Thanks so much.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Erik. As you know, our gross margins are a factor of many, many variables. Commodities, of course, are important. They're not the only factor. But specifically on commodities, I can tell you that both for the September quarter and what we expect for the December quarter, most commodities are going to move down in price, while NAND and DRAM increased during the course of the September quarter and we expect them to increase during the December quarter. We are very pleased with the level of gross margins that we've reported during the course of the year. The entire fiscal year of '24, they're really, for our company, record levels of gross margin, and obviously guiding to 46% to 47% for the December quarter with all the new technologies that we've included in the products, with all the new features that Tim has talked about, a lot of new products across the board, I think it's a very good sign.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much, Luca.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes from Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. And I'll echo those comments about Luca. Miss you, and good luck. And my question is with regard to iPhone again, and with regard to the fourth quarter, is my first question -- or sorry, the fourth calendar quarter, your first quarter. When you look at mid- to low-single-digit revenue growth, do you expect the iPhone to grow faster? And what are you thinking about in the answer to that question with regard to China, which keeps improving each quarter? Thanks very much. And then, I have just a follow-up. Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Ben, we are not providing that level of color today. Yes, we've said that we expect total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits. Keep in mind, Apple Intelligence, as Tim said, is rolling out over time, both features and languages. And we just had a number of exciting launches just this week from the Apple Intelligence feature to the new Mac. So, we leave it at that. We've given you the total for the company and some pretty good direction on Services, which we expect to continue to grow at a similar rate than what we've seen in fiscal '24.\nBen Reitzes: Great. Thanks, Luca. Hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you, I mean, you guys are well aware a lot of the noise out there, people chattering about builds, lead times, and you guys are guiding for mid- to low-single-digit growth. That certainly doesn't sound like alarm bells here, vis-a-vis what you guys must be hearing. And I know you guys are just running your business and doing the best you can, but you have a lot of perspective now, Tim. What are people missing here? And it certainly just sounds like -- you guys are typically conservative. That guide for revenue is certainly sounds like [this guy is certainly not falling] (ph), and you have a pretty good product cycle. So, what do you think people are missing and what are you excited about? Thanks so much, Tim.\nTim Cook: Ben, I could not be more excited about Apple Intelligence and the rollout that we've got in front of us. I'm on the -- I'm obviously on future releases as well, working on it and it's changing my daily life. I'm super excited about the health features that we're rolling out. If the number of emails I'm already getting from customers that have taken a hearing test and are using their AirPods Pro 2 as a hearing aid, are just -- are staggering and heartwarming to read. I'm also thrilled about sleep apnea and the notification there that we'll have through the watch. This week is a very exciting week for us because we just rolled out three days -- three launches of different, Macs and desktops and laptops. And so, we have a lot of things on the docket and it's definitely the strongest lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season. In terms of the noise, I tune it out, because if not, it would just be, deafening. And so that that's what I do, I can't speak for everybody else, but that's what I do.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim. Appreciate it.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Ben.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two as well. And Luca, best of luck in the future. It's been a pleasure working with you. I guess the first one I have is, away from iPhones, on the Services side, you're adding $100 billion run rate with Services today, which is a phenomenal achievement by itself. As you look at the Services portfolio today, can you just talk about how much of this business do you think is reoccurring versus transactional? And are the growth rates different between the subscription portfolio over here versus transactional portfolio?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit, I'll take this one. Yes, we are, first of all, very, very happy with -- it's an important milestone. Of course, we've got to a run rate of $100 billion. You look back just a few years ago, and the growth has been phenomenal. We're very pleased. We've got a very diversified portfolio of services. And over the years, the amount that is recurring in nature has grown and is growing faster than the transactional piece. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions on our platform right now between our own services and third-party services. That continues to grow strong double-digits. So, we feel very, very good. And, essentially, to your question, yes, the recurring portion is growing faster than the transactional one.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. If I can just follow-up, if I look at the growth rates across the different geographies, there's always concern around China when it comes to iPhone demand, I feel, but the performance in September looks fairly good. I wonder if you just touch on, what are you seeing from a demand perspective in China? If the recent stimulus plan in China could essentially be a catalyst for iPhone? And then, EMEA really stood out with double-digit growth. Maybe you can just flush that out as well for us. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah, I'll take the China question. If you look at how we did for the quarter, we were relatively flat year-over-year. And a key component of that improvement relative to the year-over-year performance that we had been achieving is that there was a sequential improvement in foreign exchange. And so that helped us out. As you know, it's been a headwind that we've been reporting for a period of time. And -- but the other parts that are -- what else is going on there is that our installed base of the active devices reached an all-time high. We had the top two selling, smartphones in Urban China according to Kantar. The level of new customers that we have buying the products like Mac and iPad are well over 50%. Watch is over three quarters that are new to the product. And so, there's several positive signs there. In terms of the stimulus, it's a clear focus of the team there, but I'm not an economist and don't want to ad lib on the effect of it.\nLuca Maestri: On the Europe side, Amit, a number of things. As you see from our results during the quarter, Europe grew double-digits, 11%, and really, it was really good growth across the board, the different segments. They all did well. Keep in mind, our definition of Europe in our segment reporting includes a number of emerging markets, like Turkey, where we've grown very strongly, the Middle East. Tim mentioned a number of records in Saudi, in UAE, and we also include India where we set an all-time revenue record during the September quarter. But I have to say also Western Europe grew nicely. So, we've seen very good results for us in the entire segment.\nAmit Daryanani: Great. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks everyone for taking my question, and congratulations, Luca. I know Luca, and I know Tim, you don't want to give a lot of granularity, but if I just try to pull together your comments about what the demand environment looks like, are we to assume based on sort of the commentary that there is a risk that maybe the product revenue portfolio could be down in the December quarter if I take your numbers at face value? And if that's the risk, is that more iPhone-related, Mac-related, given the strength that you've seen in iPad related? Just trying to get a handle on kind of what potentially is giving you that degree of, I don't want to say caution, but maybe balanced for you going into the December quarter. And then, I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: As I said, David, we're not providing that level of color. We're giving you some data on services. I would repeat what I said earlier. We're very early in the cycle, very early in the cycle with a lot of new products and features that that we are launching. And we're very excited about them, but it's early. And the Apple Intelligence rollout is going to happen over time, not across the world as normally we do with software releases.\nDavid Vogt: Right. Okay. So maybe a follow-up for, Tim. When you think about to Luca's point about the rollout being staged over the next several quarters across the world, do you think that has any impact on sort of the normal historical demand cadence across different regions? So, should we see something different, let's say, in the December quarter, the March quarter, the June quarter, et cetera, relative to history, given the timing of the rollout and where customers are probably waiting for the devices to be enabled to have the operating system? Would just love to kind of get your perspective on how we think about the demand cadence, how it might be different than maybe historically? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah, David. It's clearly, as you point out, a different cadence, if you will, than we would normally do. As we talked about at WWDC, we wanted to give a comprehensive vision of Apple Intelligence, and we said then that it would rollout over time. And we're right on the, what we said, at WWDC, and so we're executing well. In terms of the demand curve, I would just say that what we believe here is that it's a compelling reason for upgrading. And, it's -- that's both my personal experience and feedback that I'm getting and so we'll see. We're not projecting, beyond the current quarter obviously. We just don't do that.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, Tim, and best of luck, Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Luca, we will miss you on these calls. Tim, maybe for you, as you think about this staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence, can you help us think through potentially how much of the global installed base of phones will have access to Apple Intelligence in their native language, in their region within the next year or maybe in the next two years? And what are some of the gating factors in the rollout? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: If you look at our schedule, we started in the -- with US English, that started on Monday. There's another release coming that adds additional features that I had referenced in December in not only US English but also localized for UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. And then, we will add more languages in April. We haven't set the specifics yet in terms of the languages, but we'll add more in April and then more as we step through the year. And so, we're moving just as fast as possible while ensuring quality. That's what we're doing.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nWamsi Mohan: And then, as a follow-up, maybe this is a little premature, but how is Apple at a high level prepared to potentially deal with any tariffs that might come post the selection cycle? And if not exactly how, perhaps you can just help investors think about some of the things Apple has done already to try to insulate from some of these impacts, potential impacts?\nTim Cook: I wouldn't want to speculate about those sorts of things. And so, I'm going to punt on that one.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Wamsi. May we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. And again, thanks Luca for all your help with analyts and investors. My first question is on R&D. Given how much your tech peers are spending on AI, does this new era of Apple Intelligence actually require Apple to invest more in R&D beyond your current 7% to 8% of sales to capture this opportunity? And then, I had a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Krish, as you know, we've been investing heavily in R&D over the last several years. Our R&D growth has been significant during the last several years. And obviously, as we move through the course of fiscal '24, we've also reallocated some of the existing resources to this new technology to AI. And so, the level of intensity that we're putting into AI has increased a lot, and you maybe don't see the full extent of it because we've also had some internal reallocation of the base of engineering resources that we have within the company.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks for that, Luca. And then, another quick follow-up. I understand Apple Intelligence is a feature on the phone today, but do you think that, in the future, it could potentially have or benefit the services growth business, or is that too -- are these too bifurcated to even make a call on the [indiscernible]? Thank you.\nTim Cook: I think, just to keep it in mind, Apple Intelligence is also available on the Mac for the M-series products and on certain models of iPad, and in addition to the phone. And so, it's on all three. You're quite -- what was your follow-on question?\nKrish Sankar: Tim, it does on -- can the Apple Intelligence actually help the Services growth rate?\nTim Cook: Keep in mind that we were have released a lot of APIs and developers will be taking advantage of those APIs. That release has occurred as well and of course more are coming. And so I, definitely believe that a lot of developers will be taking advantage of Apple Intelligence in a big way. And what that does to Services, I'll not forecast, but I would say that from an ecosystem point of view, I think it will be great for the user and the user experience.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Krish. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. And Luca, congrats on the new role and pleasure working with you these years. I guess, if I could, for my first one, start with mix on the iPhone side? And what I'm really curious about if you have any thoughts given that Apple Intelligence is now going to be a consistent feature set across all the four sort of iPhones on the iPhone 16 series that you launched and going back to iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Are you seeing any change in behavior from a consumer perspective in terms of which sort of on the mix front within the iPhone series where consumer adoption is given that there's more consistency of the features when it comes to Apple Intelligence across the board? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: It's tough to answer your question, because we've been constrained in October on the Pro and the Pro Max. And so, it's really too early in the curve to call the precise mix on the consumer versus the Pro. So, we'll see.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And for my follow-up, Tim, during the quarter I think over the last 90 days, we had the quotes come out in relation to the DOJ relative to the Google sort of revenue sharing agreement that you have with them. How do you sort of look at it going forward in terms of emphasizing the role that Apple has in that ecosystem with Safari and sort of the potential outcomes that you're looking at? Thank you.\nTim Cook: I don't want to speculate on that from a legal point of view. It's an ongoing case, and I will save that for another day.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Samik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks very much. My first one, Tim, I'd like to ask about some of the components in Services where despite your installed base, some parts of the Apple One bundle, like Music and News and Arcade and Fitness, are not obviously the market-leading offerings. And maybe what might change that and what other services could you call out as growing faster, having wider -- widening addressable markets like we've seen in pay or advertising?\nTim Cook: The way that I view it is that we have lots of opportunity in all of those. And so, there's lots of customers to try to convince to take advantage of it, and we're going to continue investing in the Services and adding new features and -- whether it's News+ or Music or Arcade, that's what we're going to do. Keep in mind that for us, we're more focused on being best than being most. And so, in some cases, not in every case, some of the services that you -- the majority of the services that you mentioned are not cross platform. We make them for our customers only and so that in some cases changes the person who's going to sell the most perhaps, but that's -- our objective is to make the best.\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thanks. And then, Luca, one piece of unfinished business was your pledge to get to a net-neutral cash position. And over the last two years, you stayed around $50 billion of net cash. We've clearly seen instances in the past where elevated marketing spend or other programs brought increases in market share. I guess my question looking back on your tenure is, at your scale now of $57 billion of OpEx, do you still see incremental ways to put that cash to work in the business? Or will we just continue to see increased shareholder returns?\nLuca Maestri: Well, obviously, as you've seen, our OpEx has gone up over the years. We've also seen at the same time a significant expansion in gross margin, maybe to a level that I would have not expected a few years ago, but we've done a very good job on a number of fronts. And so, I would say we -- when we plan -- every time we plan for the upcoming year, we think about all the different areas where we can deploy our resources and we make them available to grow the business. I think we've done very well over the long term and -- but our fundamental philosophy is to look after the business first. And then, if we have excess cash, we will continue to return it to our shareholders and the plan has worked quite well so far.\nRichard Kramer: Okay. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. We'll take our last question, please, operator?\nOperator: Our last question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Thank you for squeezing me in. It seems to us that the spec differentiation between iPhone 16 Pro and base model isn't as big as prior years. All iPhones have new A18, A18 Pro chips and there wasn't an increase in ASPs versus last year. Can you share with us if there is a shift in your strategy in terms of...\nOperator: Unfortunately, Mr. Malik's line has dropped.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Sorry, Atif. We'll connect offline. Thank you, everybody. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. The number for the telephone replay is 866-583-1035. Please enter confirmation code 0331536 followed by the pound sign. These replays will be available by approximately 5 pm Pacific today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Josh Rosenstock at 408-862-1142. And financial analysts can contact me, Suhasini Chandramouli, with additional questions at 408-974-3123 Thank you again for joining us.\nOperator: Once again, this does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate your participation.",

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook : Thank you Suhasini. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And we set an all-time revenue record in services which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and Machine Learning. It will transform how users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to image playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than ever. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud compute, a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud, while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and we remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more countries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, watching movies on 100-foot screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for Vision OS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we announced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more. And we've seen great interest for Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We are doing that across every product and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, exceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, messages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, offering a transformative set of capabilities. Mac revenue was $7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Customers are loving the latest M3-powered 13 and 15 inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus and small business owners, developers, and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020, is capable of taking advantage of Apple Intelligence with Mac OS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our products. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 and 13 inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And With the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of power-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, Video Editors and Musicians can take advantage of the cutting edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered by the M series of Apple silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the core of Apple Watch, are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking steadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieve revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, cloud, and payment services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the Upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigators starring Matt Damon. And we can't wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 wins to-date. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs our best ever showing for the upcoming awards event. During the quarter, we also expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept contactless payments. And we announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make the most of our library of workouts and meditations. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first ever location in Malaysia. Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro and demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time. At the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for everyone. And in honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products can do. These include eye tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to experience music, and vocal shortcuts that tie task to a user's voice. And we are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of privacy for our users. With everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third-parties from tracking you across the internet or providing new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. And we are just as dedicated to ensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. And we continue to make significant progress on the environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. At Apple, we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more excited for all the amazing things yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri : Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite 230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with an all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance range and down 30 basis points sequentially driven by a different mix within products which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost savings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74% down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7% year-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion, diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines. And the iPhone Active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June quarter, many iPhone models were among the top selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top selling model in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451 Research measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving the latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities and much more. The iPad install base has continued to grow and is an all-time high, as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch and AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate a customer satisfaction of 97% for watch in the US. In services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services, as the growth of our installed base of active devices, sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reach a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, paid subscriptions showed strong double digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services. From critically acclaimed new content on Apple TV+ to new games on Apple Arcade and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses, leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers. USAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees with the latest MacBook Air. And American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe Tim, if we start with you, you know, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are, and what that translates to in potential pent-up demand, as we enter a new iPhone cycle. And I have a follow-up, thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, hi Eric. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency. And the 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that -- that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.\nErik Woodring: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, Tim. And then second, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward. Thanks so much.\nTim Cook: Yeah, Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and so we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders and so that's a very strong signal and in fact from Kantar -- the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. Also, if you look at -- one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes all the way back to the September of 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the majority of customers buying or buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time and the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying a product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long-term.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Hey, Tim, you know, now that you've launched or announced Apple intelligence, do you have any ideas on how it may impact services. Would it – do you feel like it'll accelerate your Services business augmented? And maybe folks will need to buy more storage and some other things. How are you thinking about it as a catalyst for Services into next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nTim Cook: We started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week with developers, so some of the features are out there as of Monday. And we couldn't be more excited about getting them out there. Obviously, this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. And so we are taking the first step in getting the beta out there, and we can't wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it.\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Thanks. And then Luca, with regard to gross margin, it's been -- there's been some component price inflation and mix. Do you mind just giving us a little more color on how you are managing that sequentially and how you feel about the current component environment as an impact on margins? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Sure, Ben. I think I'll give you a bit of the walk for the June quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the September quarter. At the total company level, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially, and it was really driven by a different mix. Within products, of course, we launched very important products like the iPad during the course of the quarter. But we had an offset from a shift in mix towards Services, and we got some good cost savings. And so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. And keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us. As we go into the September quarter, we are guiding 45.5% to 46.5%, which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again similar dynamics, we expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a year-over-year basis. On the commodity side, I think that is what you are referring to, yes we have seen some increases on the memory front, but the rest of the commodities, we see a continuous decline. So in general, we feel -- we're well positioned. And as you know well, these are very high levels of gross margin for us and we are pleased where we are.\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Ben. Operator may we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMike Ng: Hi, good afternoon. I just have two questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you've seen a shift in demand for iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max models since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence enabled phones?\nTim Cook: We just announced the sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in June. And so we had very limited time during the quarter. So it's really too early to tell.\nMike Ng: That's fair. And then with the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you are expecting from the US promotional environment from your channel partners, whether that's US wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle. Or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period? Thank you.\nTim Cook: We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings, and it is another compelling reason for an upgrade. I'd leave the promotional question for the sort of the carriers themselves to answer. But I believe it will be a very key time for -- and a compelling upgrade cycle.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon everyone. And I have two as well. I guess, Tim, maybe back to the Apple Intelligence dynamic. There's clearly a lot of excitement from consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean for them. Can you just touch on your -- do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence features at the same time to consumers, or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit? And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next-generation iPhone?\nTim Cook: The rollout, as we mentioned in June, sort of -- we've actually started with developers this week. We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond US English that will happen over the course of the year, and there are other features that will happen over the course of the year. And ChatGPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year. And so yes, so it’s a staggered launch.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then I guess your Services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and it seems like it is accelerated recently. Can you just touch -- talk about when you look at this double-digit growth, how much of that do you think is coming from the installed base growth versus better ARPU or better monetization of the installed base? And how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit, it is Luca. It's a combination of a number of factors. The installed base growth is very important of course, because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our Services. We are seeing and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now. We see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. We have more transacting accounts every quarter, so more people using the ecosystem both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters. Now we look at our paid subscriptions on our platform, and they are growing strong double digits as well. So obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an ARPU standpoint and just a volume standpoint. Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time, and we've launched many new services, fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. And so we are providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we believe we are doing also a very good job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We are launching new shows, new games all the time. And I think you will continue to see that as we go forward. We are very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because, particularly if you look at the performance that we had in Services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. But in spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Amit. Operator we will take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Tim, you announced Apple Intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners. But you're obviously -- they're leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. So in the long-term, do you see the Apple Intelligence part -- the Services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor over time? Or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: I think the way that I look at it is that Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and the Private Cloud Compute. And a lot of that will be things with a personal context. And then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially, and that will be focused on world knowledge as I said. And so the monetization model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they are confidential between the parties. But I see both aspects as being very important. People want both.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks. As a follow-up maybe for Luca. Just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again. If I look at calendar 2023, you had on average 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024 so far, it had been more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental headwind, I mean there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years. So ex-FX, are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. Of course, as you said, the foreign exchange continues to be -- this is incremental on a year-over-year basis. And it is one of those things that is outside of our control. We try to hedge our exposures. But it is what it is. We know that when the dollar is strong, our gross margins are affected. The other element that I think it's always important to keep in mind is that within the Products business, our products have different margin profiles. And depending on the relative success in the marketplace, our products' gross margin tends to move. And so the mix of our products has an impact on gross margins, right? And so we need to pay attention to that. Of course, we just launched an iPad and that is one of the factors. But we want all our products to be very successful in the marketplace. And that's why we always look at gross margin dollars as the first order of priority, and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. The other factor that obviously has an impact, a significant impact is the state of the commodity markets, and they tend to go in cycles. And so we will see how that plays out over time. But in general, we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business, and we think we are in a good position there.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Wamsi. Operator, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the strong results. The first one for Luca or Tim. We keep hearing about these increasing silicon content for AI edge devices. And also, I think, Luca you spoke about increasing commodity costs. So I'm curious how to think about margins for these new AI devices. And Tim, do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nTim Cook: Maybe I'll take the second one first and then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. And so from an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products obviously. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020. And the iPad is the same, and so it starts with the M series of silicon. And so there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.\nLuca Maestri: And from a gross margin standpoint, as you know, we don't provide any color past the current quarter, and we just provided guidance for the quarter 45.5% to 46.5%. It is essentially broadly in line with what we reported for the June quarter. So we'll take it quarter by quarter and we will report as the time goes by.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for Tim. Thanks for the color on China. We also see many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk about a weak China. And I think Tim, you said half the details was FX related. I'm curious, the other half of the weakness, was that more China macro related or do you think it is kind of like specific to Apple with domestic competitors? Any other color you could give would be very helpful. Thank you very much.\nTim Cook: Well, certainly, the competitive environment there is the most competitive in the world. I've said that before and that remains to be the case. The macroeconomic factors have been in the press too, and I'm not an expert on those. I can only tell you what we're seeing. And we were pleased that the business showed improvement from the first half of the year.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Krish. Operator, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Two, if I may also. Tim, first one for you. I know it is early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of -- are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it. And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.\nTim Cook: If you look at how we've deployed Apple Intelligence or are deploying Apple Intelligence, we've really thought about it at pretty much all of the apps that you use every day. And so we've thought about it from Notes to Mail to Messages and all the rest. And so there is been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. And that's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user, in a way that will I think, get them very excited about it and get usage. Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. And so I think, it is profound and we'll see what the developers do. But we're very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing, yes.\nDavid Vogt: Yes. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And Luca, just maybe -- I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter, it sounds like with Services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit. You are effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year ahead of a product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for, what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Well, we have provided -- let me repeat what we provided. We think that we are going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported, so the plus 5%, right? In spite of the fact that we are going to have some foreign exchange headwinds, and we said about 150 basis points in the December quarter. And we said that we will grow Services double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've reported for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We are not going into the other categories. I think there is a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you here. Keep in mind on the Mac that we will have a challenging compare from a year ago, given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch a year ago. And also on the iPad, we reported 24% growth in the June quarter. Clearly we had the benefit from the launch in the June quarter of the new products, the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. So important to keep that in mind on a sequential basis.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you David. Operator may we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one is for Tim. I know it's early days. The feedback on Apple Intelligence software features like notification summary and reduced interruption focus from the developers who have tried the iOS 18.1 beta version this week is very positive. My question is in response to an earlier question, you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features. So are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18? Or we should be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?\nTim Cook: Our objective that we said in June is to roll out US English starting in the fall and that is to users, and then proceed with more functionality, more features, if you will, and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. And so we sort of gave a time frame that -- and we're tracking to that.\nAtif Malik: Understand. And the next one for Luca. Luca the Services growth momentum seems very strong. Are you seeing any impact from changes made to comply with the DMA rules?\nLuca Maestri: Well, as you know we have introduced some changes to the way we run the App Store in Europe already in March. And we are seeing a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. We are on an ongoing basis, discussing with the European Commission how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. It is obviously early stage, but in general, our results for the Services business and for the App Store have been pretty good until now. Again to just provide you a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue that we generate from the European Union on the App Store is about 7% of the total.\nAtif Malik: Very helpful. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Atif. Operator may we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just ask you about Apple Intelligence as well. There is a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you are aiming for and the timelines you're thinking. How are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process, in particular like EU and maybe China? And does -- in terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here? And how should we think about timing then including that? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: We are engaged as you would guess, with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. And our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a schedule to doing that. But we're very constructively engaged with both.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. And a quick one on the Wearables category, Luca. I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of what -- which categories drove the acceleration because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. So just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, I'll take that one. I think the important thing to remember when you look at the Wearables, Home and Accessories categories is that we have a difficult launch compare. And we've been running that for a few quarters and we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the very first Watch Ultra. And so it is important to keep that in mind. If you sort of take a step back, however and look at the business across the trailing 12 months, it is grown -- the Wearables, Home and Accessories business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was five years ago.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Samik. Operator, may we have the last question please.\nOperator: Our last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks. Thanks very much. Tim, you referenced the investment in innovation, and your R&D sales ratio reached what I think was a June quarter record even before launching Apple Intelligence. Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity? And is it even possible to forecast the Services usage as they roll out, given that they are so new for consumers? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Clearly, we have increased R&D over time. We have been investing in AI and ML for years. And in addition to investing more, we've also redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML. And so the growth in sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here, it is increasing year-over-year. On the CapEx part, it is important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach, where we do things internally and we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. But yes, I mean you can expect that there is -- we will continue to invest and increase it year-on-year.\nRichard Kramer: Okay. And maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they are up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the Services mix or cost control is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, I'm glad you noticed that. We are pretty pleased with that fact. And I think you probably also noticed that we've increased our return of capital to shareholders this quarter. This one was a record quarter for us. Well, it's a combination of a number of things. Of course, an improvement in the top-line helps the margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. And so that is driving better operating cash flow. On the CapEx front as Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay, as we go. But in general, we try to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. And therefore, we are pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.\nRichard Kramer: Okay. Thanks.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook : Thank you Suhasini. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And we set an all-time revenue record in services which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and Machine Learning. It will transform how users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to image playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than ever. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud compute, a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud, while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and we remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more countries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, watching movies on 100-foot screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for Vision OS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we announced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more. And we've seen great interest for Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We are doing that across every product and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, exceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, messages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, offering a transformative set of capabilities. Mac revenue was $7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Customers are loving the latest M3-powered 13 and 15 inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus and small business owners, developers, and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020, is capable of taking advantage of Apple Intelligence with Mac OS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our products. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 and 13 inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And With the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of power-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, Video Editors and Musicians can take advantage of the cutting edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered by the M series of Apple silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the core of Apple Watch, are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking steadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieve revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, cloud, and payment services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the Upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigators starring Matt Damon. And we can't wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 wins to-date. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs our best ever showing for the upcoming awards event. During the quarter, we also expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept contactless payments. And we announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make the most of our library of workouts and meditations. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first ever location in Malaysia. Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro and demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time. At the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for everyone. And in honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products can do. These include eye tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to experience music, and vocal shortcuts that tie task to a user's voice. And we are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of privacy for our users. With everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third-parties from tracking you across the internet or providing new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. And we are just as dedicated to ensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. And we continue to make significant progress on the environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. At Apple, we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more excited for all the amazing things yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri : Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite 230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with an all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance range and down 30 basis points sequentially driven by a different mix within products which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost savings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74% down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7% year-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion, diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines. And the iPhone Active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June quarter, many iPhone models were among the top selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top selling model in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451 Research measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving the latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities and much more. The iPad install base has continued to grow and is an all-time high, as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch and AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate a customer satisfaction of 97% for watch in the US. In services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services, as the growth of our installed base of active devices, sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reach a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, paid subscriptions showed strong double digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services. From critically acclaimed new content on Apple TV+ to new games on Apple Arcade and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses, leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers. USAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees with the latest MacBook Air. And American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe Tim, if we start with you, you know, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are, and what that translates to in potential pent-up demand, as we enter a new iPhone cycle. And I have a follow-up, thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, hi Eric. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency. And the 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that -- that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.\nErik Woodring: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, Tim. And then second, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward. Thanks so much.\nTim Cook: Yeah, Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and so we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders and so that's a very strong signal and in fact from Kantar -- the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. Also, if you look at -- one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes all the way back to the September of 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the majority of customers buying or buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time and the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying a product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long-term.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Hey, Tim, you know, now that you've launched or announced Apple intelligence, do you have any ideas on how it may impact services. Would it – do you feel like it'll accelerate your Services business augmented? And maybe folks will need to buy more storage and some other things. How are you thinking about it as a catalyst for Services into next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nTim Cook: We started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week with developers, so some of the features are out there as of Monday. And we couldn't be more excited about getting them out there. Obviously, this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. And so we are taking the first step in getting the beta out there, and we can't wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it.\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Thanks. And then Luca, with regard to gross margin, it's been -- there's been some component price inflation and mix. Do you mind just giving us a little more color on how you are managing that sequentially and how you feel about the current component environment as an impact on margins? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Sure, Ben. I think I'll give you a bit of the walk for the June quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the September quarter. At the total company level, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially, and it was really driven by a different mix. Within products, of course, we launched very important products like the iPad during the course of the quarter. But we had an offset from a shift in mix towards Services, and we got some good cost savings. And so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. And keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us. As we go into the September quarter, we are guiding 45.5% to 46.5%, which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again similar dynamics, we expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a year-over-year basis. On the commodity side, I think that is what you are referring to, yes we have seen some increases on the memory front, but the rest of the commodities, we see a continuous decline. So in general, we feel -- we're well positioned. And as you know well, these are very high levels of gross margin for us and we are pleased where we are.\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Ben. Operator may we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMike Ng: Hi, good afternoon. I just have two questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you've seen a shift in demand for iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max models since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence enabled phones?\nTim Cook: We just announced the sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in June. And so we had very limited time during the quarter. So it's really too early to tell.\nMike Ng: That's fair. And then with the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you are expecting from the US promotional environment from your channel partners, whether that's US wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle. Or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period? Thank you.\nTim Cook: We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings, and it is another compelling reason for an upgrade. I'd leave the promotional question for the sort of the carriers themselves to answer. But I believe it will be a very key time for -- and a compelling upgrade cycle.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon everyone. And I have two as well. I guess, Tim, maybe back to the Apple Intelligence dynamic. There's clearly a lot of excitement from consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean for them. Can you just touch on your -- do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence features at the same time to consumers, or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit? And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next-generation iPhone?\nTim Cook: The rollout, as we mentioned in June, sort of -- we've actually started with developers this week. We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond US English that will happen over the course of the year, and there are other features that will happen over the course of the year. And ChatGPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year. And so yes, so it’s a staggered launch.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then I guess your Services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and it seems like it is accelerated recently. Can you just touch -- talk about when you look at this double-digit growth, how much of that do you think is coming from the installed base growth versus better ARPU or better monetization of the installed base? And how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit, it is Luca. It's a combination of a number of factors. The installed base growth is very important of course, because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our Services. We are seeing and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now. We see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. We have more transacting accounts every quarter, so more people using the ecosystem both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters. Now we look at our paid subscriptions on our platform, and they are growing strong double digits as well. So obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an ARPU standpoint and just a volume standpoint. Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time, and we've launched many new services, fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. And so we are providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we believe we are doing also a very good job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We are launching new shows, new games all the time. And I think you will continue to see that as we go forward. We are very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because, particularly if you look at the performance that we had in Services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. But in spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Amit. Operator we will take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Tim, you announced Apple Intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners. But you're obviously -- they're leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. So in the long-term, do you see the Apple Intelligence part -- the Services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor over time? Or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: I think the way that I look at it is that Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and the Private Cloud Compute. And a lot of that will be things with a personal context. And then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially, and that will be focused on world knowledge as I said. And so the monetization model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they are confidential between the parties. But I see both aspects as being very important. People want both.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks. As a follow-up maybe for Luca. Just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again. If I look at calendar 2023, you had on average 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024 so far, it had been more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental headwind, I mean there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years. So ex-FX, are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. Of course, as you said, the foreign exchange continues to be -- this is incremental on a year-over-year basis. And it is one of those things that is outside of our control. We try to hedge our exposures. But it is what it is. We know that when the dollar is strong, our gross margins are affected. The other element that I think it's always important to keep in mind is that within the Products business, our products have different margin profiles. And depending on the relative success in the marketplace, our products' gross margin tends to move. And so the mix of our products has an impact on gross margins, right? And so we need to pay attention to that. Of course, we just launched an iPad and that is one of the factors. But we want all our products to be very successful in the marketplace. And that's why we always look at gross margin dollars as the first order of priority, and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. The other factor that obviously has an impact, a significant impact is the state of the commodity markets, and they tend to go in cycles. And so we will see how that plays out over time. But in general, we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business, and we think we are in a good position there.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Wamsi. Operator, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the strong results. The first one for Luca or Tim. We keep hearing about these increasing silicon content for AI edge devices. And also, I think, Luca you spoke about increasing commodity costs. So I'm curious how to think about margins for these new AI devices. And Tim, do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nTim Cook: Maybe I'll take the second one first and then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. And so from an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products obviously. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020. And the iPad is the same, and so it starts with the M series of silicon. And so there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.\nLuca Maestri: And from a gross margin standpoint, as you know, we don't provide any color past the current quarter, and we just provided guidance for the quarter 45.5% to 46.5%. It is essentially broadly in line with what we reported for the June quarter. So we'll take it quarter by quarter and we will report as the time goes by.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for Tim. Thanks for the color on China. We also see many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk about a weak China. And I think Tim, you said half the details was FX related. I'm curious, the other half of the weakness, was that more China macro related or do you think it is kind of like specific to Apple with domestic competitors? Any other color you could give would be very helpful. Thank you very much.\nTim Cook: Well, certainly, the competitive environment there is the most competitive in the world. I've said that before and that remains to be the case. The macroeconomic factors have been in the press too, and I'm not an expert on those. I can only tell you what we're seeing. And we were pleased that the business showed improvement from the first half of the year.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Krish. Operator, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Two, if I may also. Tim, first one for you. I know it is early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of -- are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it. And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.\nTim Cook: If you look at how we've deployed Apple Intelligence or are deploying Apple Intelligence, we've really thought about it at pretty much all of the apps that you use every day. And so we've thought about it from Notes to Mail to Messages and all the rest. And so there is been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. And that's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user, in a way that will I think, get them very excited about it and get usage. Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. And so I think, it is profound and we'll see what the developers do. But we're very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing, yes.\nDavid Vogt: Yes. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And Luca, just maybe -- I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter, it sounds like with Services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit. You are effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year ahead of a product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for, what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Well, we have provided -- let me repeat what we provided. We think that we are going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported, so the plus 5%, right? In spite of the fact that we are going to have some foreign exchange headwinds, and we said about 150 basis points in the December quarter. And we said that we will grow Services double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've reported for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We are not going into the other categories. I think there is a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you here. Keep in mind on the Mac that we will have a challenging compare from a year ago, given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch a year ago. And also on the iPad, we reported 24% growth in the June quarter. Clearly we had the benefit from the launch in the June quarter of the new products, the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. So important to keep that in mind on a sequential basis.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you David. Operator may we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one is for Tim. I know it's early days. The feedback on Apple Intelligence software features like notification summary and reduced interruption focus from the developers who have tried the iOS 18.1 beta version this week is very positive. My question is in response to an earlier question, you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features. So are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18? Or we should be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?\nTim Cook: Our objective that we said in June is to roll out US English starting in the fall and that is to users, and then proceed with more functionality, more features, if you will, and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. And so we sort of gave a time frame that -- and we're tracking to that.\nAtif Malik: Understand. And the next one for Luca. Luca the Services growth momentum seems very strong. Are you seeing any impact from changes made to comply with the DMA rules?\nLuca Maestri: Well, as you know we have introduced some changes to the way we run the App Store in Europe already in March. And we are seeing a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. We are on an ongoing basis, discussing with the European Commission how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. It is obviously early stage, but in general, our results for the Services business and for the App Store have been pretty good until now. Again to just provide you a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue that we generate from the European Union on the App Store is about 7% of the total.\nAtif Malik: Very helpful. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Atif. Operator may we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just ask you about Apple Intelligence as well. There is a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you are aiming for and the timelines you're thinking. How are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process, in particular like EU and maybe China? And does -- in terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here? And how should we think about timing then including that? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: We are engaged as you would guess, with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. And our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a schedule to doing that. But we're very constructively engaged with both.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. And a quick one on the Wearables category, Luca. I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of what -- which categories drove the acceleration because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. So just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, I'll take that one. I think the important thing to remember when you look at the Wearables, Home and Accessories categories is that we have a difficult launch compare. And we've been running that for a few quarters and we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the very first Watch Ultra. And so it is important to keep that in mind. If you sort of take a step back, however and look at the business across the trailing 12 months, it is grown -- the Wearables, Home and Accessories business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was five years ago.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Samik. Operator, may we have the last question please.\nOperator: Our last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks. Thanks very much. Tim, you referenced the investment in innovation, and your R&D sales ratio reached what I think was a June quarter record even before launching Apple Intelligence. Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity? And is it even possible to forecast the Services usage as they roll out, given that they are so new for consumers? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Clearly, we have increased R&D over time. We have been investing in AI and ML for years. And in addition to investing more, we've also redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML. And so the growth in sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here, it is increasing year-over-year. On the CapEx part, it is important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach, where we do things internally and we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. But yes, I mean you can expect that there is -- we will continue to invest and increase it year-on-year.\nRichard Kramer: Okay. And maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they are up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the Services mix or cost control is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, I'm glad you noticed that. We are pretty pleased with that fact. And I think you probably also noticed that we've increased our return of capital to shareholders this quarter. This one was a record quarter for us. Well, it's a combination of a number of things. Of course, an improvement in the top-line helps the margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. And so that is driving better operating cash flow. On the CapEx front as Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay, as we go. But in general, we try to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. And therefore, we are pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.\nRichard Kramer: Okay. Thanks.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2025 Agilent Technologies Inc. Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Parmeet Ahuja, you may begin the conference.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining the Q and A will be Simon May, President of the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group Angelica Riemann, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group and Mike Zhang, President of the Applied Markets Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The press release for our second quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth is adjusted for the impact of currency exchange rates and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past twelve months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we implemented certain changes to our reporting structure related to the reorganization of our three business segments. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes and have provided the financial details on our website. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Agilent delivered strong second quarter results in a highly dynamic market environment. Revenue of $1.67 billion for the second quarter represented growth of 6% reported and up 5.3% core compared with the second quarter of 2024. Operating margin was a solid 25.1% as we absorbed some incremental tariff costs. We also delivered EPS of $1.31 growing 7% compared with the second quarter of 2024. Both revenue and EPS exceeded our expectations, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. Our performance was driven by growth across markets and regions, speaking to the diversity of our business. We also saw another quarter of building momentum in Instruments with our book to bill ratio again greater than one. Thank you to the Agilent team for delivering these results by tirelessly going above and beyond for our customers. No matter where I travel in the world, our customers consistently say the same thing. The Agilent team is second to none and for that reason, they want to increase their partnership and collaboration with us even more, even during a challenging macro environment. These conditions have proved the efficacy of our three year Ignite transformation, which is the execution of our strategy. We're already leveraging Ignite to create an enterprise operating model that has resulted in multiple early wins, including tariff mitigation. More on that in a moment. First, let me tell you why our Q2 was so strong. All regions grew in the quarter. Americas grew low single digits. EMEA grew mid-single digits. And China led the way at 10% growth, exceeding our expectation, while the rest of Asia grew high single digits. China saw stable demand conditions sequentially, while a favorable Lunar New Year comparison helped year on year growth. In Asia, India delivered high teens growth. India is a long term high growth innovation driven market, which is why we've opened our first India solution center there this month. The center showcases Agilent's expertise across disciplines to deliver end to end solutions in sectors such as GLP-1 analysis, emerging food and environmental contaminant analysis and PFAS detection. We also delivered mid to high single digit growth in all end markets except academia and government, which declined modestly with strong results in Asia moderating the expected softness in the US. Pharma grew 6% at the high end of expectations, led by small molecule growing low double digits. Biopharma continues to recover at a slower pace, growing low single digits as we continue to see funding challenges in small and mid-sized biotech, primarily in the US. Within biopharma, NASD was a standout growing high single digits in Q2, and we're looking forward to double digit growth from NASD in the second half of the year. In addition, while not yet part of core growth, our BIOVECTRA business performed well, exceeding guidance. BIOVECTRA's capabilities are in the sweet spot of tremendous markets, for example, GLP-1s and complex chemistries, with terrific medium and long term growth potential. We are very excited about the combined offerings of NASD and BIOVECTRA. Diagnostics and Clinical grew 8%, ahead of expectations, on strong performance of our pathology business in The Americas and Europe. Environmental and Forensics grew 6% on strong PFAS testing demand globally. PFAS testing remains strong for Agilent globally, and we see it continuing to expand into other end markets, such as food and chemical and advanced materials. In Q2, PFAS grew more than 70% year-over-year globally, with Europe and China more than doubling their business. PFAS provided an incremental 80 basis points to our growth in the quarter and is now annualizing to well over $100 million. We continue to be very optimistic about the long term growth prospects globally in PFAS as regulations and standards continue to be put in place. For PFAS testing, our Infinity III and our 6495D system is the most sensitive and robust solution. The Agilent team has deep understanding of customer challenges and how we can help them with their testing needs through delivering integrated workflow solutions, productivity and new modality application development. We are tracking over 350 regulations globally and are very confident in the continued momentum in this emerging $1 billion addressable market by 2030. In Chemicals and Advanced Materials, revenue grew 4% with high single digit growth in Advanced Materials, while Chemical and Energy was up low single digits globally. Overall, we saw growth ex-China offset by low single digit decline in China. Lower oil prices are net positive to the CAM business given it drives lower input prices to our chemical business, which is four times bigger than energy. Food grew 8%, benefiting from strength in Asia through government funded technology refresh. Our smallest end markets, academia and government, declined only 2% in the quarter, better than expected performance in the US and globally. Given we were ahead of others talking about potential US funding impacts in our first quarter earnings call and did better than expected in Q2, we feel we already have adequately captured any variability looking forward. When looking holistically across Agilent, we continue to make investments in our digital ecosystem, such as our next generation e-commerce platform, so that we can offer an outstanding customer experience. Those investments are paying off as we grew digital orders by 12% year-over-year to $295 million. I also want to highlight ACG's 9% growth this quarter, which exceeded expectations. ACG's performance was led by strong growth in automation, services and consumables. For the first time in several quarters, we saw both on demand and installation services return to growth. These results keep us on track with the long term commitments we outlined at our Analyst and Investor Day in December, including 5% to 7% core revenue growth, expanding margins 50 to 100 plus basis points annually and driving double digit EPS growth. We have momentum at Agilent. Over the past 12 months, my first year as CEO, the Agilent team has accomplished a lot. We built a formidable senior leadership team that is working in lockstep to maximize Agilent's resources to drive shareholder value. We've evolved our enterprise strategy to be market first and realigned our businesses to our markets. We acquired BIOVECTRA for roughly $1 billion to expand our CDMO capabilities, and we have moved from planning to execution in Ignite. Before providing further details on Ignite, I want to pause here and thank our Agilent team members for how quickly they have adapted to change and the company's higher ambition. It is no small feat to transform a company, and I've been impressed by our colleagues' passion for our mission and vision and their increased seals to delight customers so that Agilent continues to win in the market. These team members are leading Ignite, an initiative that is already yielding incredible results. Those incredible results include strengthening our strategic pricing capabilities and implementing enterprise wide pricing initiatives. In six months, we already have exceeded the full year price contribution from last year and are expecting at least 100 basis points of price realization in 2025, with expectations for an even greater impact in 2026 and beyond improving organization agility and efficiency by flattening management layers and increasing spans of control by 30% to improve our organization health and become a nimbler company. Additionally, we expect this to deliver annualized savings of about $80 million starting in the second half of the fiscal year. Centralizing our procurement under a Chief Procurement Officer and adopting an integrated enterprise wide approach to vendor management, we already see strong momentum exceeding our internal savings targets, ramping in the second half of this year while being essential in mitigating tariff expense with our suppliers. This is with projected procurement annualized savings exceeding $50 million by the end of 2025 and establishing a strong foundation for additional gains in 2026. Ignite has become the backbone of our operating system, enabling faster decision making, more scalable growth and over $130 million of profit for fiscal year 2025. It is our institutional engine for long term value creation. Center to value creation is our continued commitment to innovation. I'm proud to share three impactful new products that demonstrate that commitment. In our cell analysis portfolio, we just launched the Seahorse XF Flex analyzer. With its world class leading sensitivity, versatility, intuitive design and compatibility with 3D models, the XF Flex empowers more researchers than ever before to explore cellular metabolism with confidence. And at the 73rd ASMS conference next week, we will launch our latest innovation in liquid chromatography mass detection. Our new InfinityLab Pro iQ series offers unparalleled sensitivity, speed and efficiency, making it the ideal choice for customers analyzing complex biomolecules in settings where performance and lab productivity are key. At ASMS, we will also showcase our enhanced 8850-GC, now coupled with the power of our market leading DCMS that enables our customers to do more with less. We've reduced the 8850’s footprint by 50% and increased throughput up to 5x by lowering its energy usage by 45% compared with a conventional benchtop GC. We also continue to have success with our Infinity III LC in orders, funnel and our attach rates of service and consumables. We're seeing this success both geographically with robust growth in India, a particular highlight, and across all end markets, with our top customers calling out the Infinity III's superior performance, intelligence and task automation capabilities. To help further drive Agilent's internal and external innovation engine, I'm delighted to announce August Specht is joining Agilent next month as our Chief Technology Officer. August has spent over 25 years in senior R&D roles in the life sciences industry. Welcome, August. Ignite also gave us a significant head start on tariff mitigation, enabling the immediate creation of our tariff task force that has allowed us to make changes that will maintain our market strength regardless of tariff rates. We are proactively managing tariff exposure by taking several targeted actions, including focusing on specific product lines and production sites rather than adopting a one size fits all approach further diversifying our supply chain by leveraging our extensive global sourcing capabilities and manufacturing network, ensuring we're geographically even closer to customers implementing strategic pricing initiatives around the globe that protect our market competitiveness. While we remain vigilant amid geopolitical developments, our localized manufacturing, proactive tariff mitigation and a diversified customer base gives us greater resilience and agility globally than many of our peers. Through our tariff task force enabled by our Ignite operating model, we feel that we are able to mitigate most of the impact in 2025 and fully mitigate in 2026, even when considering recent developments on the US-EU tariffs. With the task force, we can create targeted analytics in a matter of hours, not days, that identify key supply chain and commercial opportunities that will allow us to maximize our tariff mitigation efforts. Our top priority is ensuring we minimize tariff impacts on our customers and that our customers have the trusted Agilent products, solutions and services they need. Looking ahead, we are confident that the long term fundamentals and secular growth drivers of our markets remain strong. For the year, we are maintaining our core growth rate of 2.5% to 3.5%, while incorporating favorable currency movements. By leveraging our Ignite program, we are fully absorbing all unmitigated FY 2025 tariff costs and maintaining our full year EPS guidance. While our results this quarter exceeded expectations, we believe it's important to remain disciplined in our outlook given the ongoing uncertainty in the macro environment and geopolitical landscape. We are committed to maintaining guidance that is both credible and achievable, and we continue to prioritize long term value creation. Bob will now share further details about our Q2 and guidance.\nRobert W. McMahon: Thanks, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our full year and third quarter guidance. As Padraig mentioned, Q2 revenue was $1.67 billion above the high end of our guidance. On a core basis, we posted growth of 5.3%, while reported growth was 6%. Currency had a negative impact of 1.6%, which was 0.5 point better than estimated as the dollar weakened during the quarter. M&A also contributed 2.3%, coming in nicely ahead of expectations. Now let me talk about our performance by business group. The Agilent CrossLab Group reported revenue of $713 million, growing 9%, which was ahead of our expectations. Double digit growth in consumables and automation and high single digit growth in services drove ACG's performance. Our life sciences and diagnostics market group reported revenue of $654 million in the quarter, growing 3%. Core growth was driven by our pathology business and NASD, both of which delivered high single digit growth and our LC and LCMS instruments that grew mid-single digits. Our cell analysis business returned to growth, up low single digits. Performance was partially offset by an expected mid-single digit decline in our NGS business. And our applied markets group reported $301 million in the quarter, flat versus last year on a core growth basis. Growth in spectroscopy and GCMS was offset by some timing related declines in gas chromatography. Before getting into the rest of the P&L, I want to cover additional details on Q2 revenue that were influenced by the April tariff announcements, primarily in China. While there was no revenue impact to Agilent overall, we did see some shifts by group in the quarter. Specifically, we saw roughly $15 million of in country ACG lab consumables revenue pulled forward into Q2 from Q3. However, this was offset by longer processing time through customs on some select instrumentation in both AMG and LGG. Again, this did not impact our overall revenue for Q2 or our Q3 outlook, but we have taken that into account by group looking forward, which I'll talk to in a minute. It is also important to note we've seen a return to normal customs processing times here in May. Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 54.1% in the quarter, roughly in line with our expectations after accounting for 55 basis points of incremental tariff costs. It is down versus last year, with the delta being equally distributed among tariffs, currency and product mix. We drove operating margins of 25.1%. While flat versus last year, excluding the 55 basis points of incremental tariffs, it would have been an increase year on year. So overall, a strong showing. Below the line, we had $2 million of income, while our tax rate of 11.5% was better than expected. And we had 285 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.31 That was ahead of our expectations and up 7% from a year ago, growing faster than core revenue. This is a very good result in the face of the dynamic macro environment, which is a testament to the Agilent team forging close collaborative partnerships with our customers. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $221 million in the quarter, and we invested $114 million in capital expenditures. We purchased $165 million in shares and paid out $70 million in dividends during the quarter. And we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1, so we continue to have a very strong balance sheet. Now let's move on to our outlook for the fiscal year and third quarter. As Padraig mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our core growth outlook for the year and increasing our reported revenue guidance by $50 million to reflect incremental FX benefit since our last guide. This results in an increase to our full year reported revenue to be in the range of $6.73 billion to $6.81 billion, increasing reported growth to 3.4% to 4.6%. Currency is now expected to represent a 1.1 percentage point headwind for the year versus a prior 1.9% headwind, while our M&A guidance is unchanged at plus 2% to 2.2% revenue impact for the year. Core growth is still expected to be between 2.5% to 3.5% for the year. We believe this is a prudent way to manage considering the dynamic macro environment. Now to help you with your models, I wanted to provide some additional perspective on our end markets. In pharma, we are monitoring the progress of US pricing policy proposals, but are not seeing a change in customer behavior. As a result, we continue to expect low to mid-single digit growth for the year, with the second half of the year continuing to show steady improvement versus the first half. For Diagnostics and Clinical, given Q2's performance, we now expect growth to be towards the upper end of mid-single digits. And we expect growth for both Chemicals and Advanced Materials and Food to continue to be in the range of low to mid-single digits, while the environmental and forensics market is a solid mid-single digit growth on PFAS strength. And lastly, as a reminder, academia and government is our smallest market at 8% of total revenue, with NIH related research representing only about 1% of revenue. We are maintaining our outlook from Q1 of a mid-single digit decline in total, with the US market being the driver. While we performed much better than we expected in Q2, we feel this is a prudent approach for the year. We are also maintaining our full year EPS guidance of $5.54 to $5.61 while covering the incremental tariff costs that I'll explain in more detail in a moment. This represents a year on year increase of 4.7% to 6%. For clarity, let me briefly summarize the tariff assumptions we've incorporated into our FY '25 guidance. Based on the tariff rates that are currently in place, we estimate that the gross incremental tariff exposure in the second half of our fiscal year is $50 million. This is on top of the roughly $10 million we have already absorbed in the first half of our fiscal year. 30% of the exposure is represented by trade between the US and China, about evenly split. Of the remaining 70%, thirty percentage points is from the EU into the US, and the remaining 40% is from the rest of the world into the US. As Padraig mentioned, we have mobilized our team using the Ignite operating model to quickly move our procurement and supply chains to minimize the tariffs and build inventory. We are using a combination of supply chain moves, like moving LC production into the US, surcharges and some of the Ignite driven savings that Padraig previously highlighted to offset the incremental costs. Importantly, we expect our actions to fully mitigate the costs in fiscal 2026. The tariff landscape continues to be dynamic and hard to predict. However, given the recent news of potentially increasing tariffs on EU sourced products to 50% as early as July 9, we felt it important to frame that exposure. If implemented on July 9, we estimate that would add another $40 million in gross exposure in the second half of the year. But through additional pricing mitigations and the inventory we've built up, we anticipate the net impact would be minimal for the year. This is the power of our tariff task force. It enables us to address tariffs at the enterprise level and align Agilent's key senior leaders so we can quickly leverage our strong and diverse supply chain footprint and adjust to the market driven approach of our unified commercial team. Finally, for your modeling, we are now projecting an increase in other income and expenses to $15 million in income, along with a 12% tax rate for the year and 285 million diluted shares outstanding. Moving to the third quarter, we are guiding to revenue of $1.645 billion to $1.675 billion. This range represents an increase of 1.7% to 3.6% growth on a core basis and an increase of 4.2% to 6.1% growth on a reported basis. Currency is a 0.6% tailwind, and M&A impact is expected to be a 1.9% benefit in the quarter. Again, while the Q2 stocking and logistics dynamics I mentioned earlier do not affect the total revenue in Q3, we do see it playing out differently by group. For that reason, we thought it helpful to provide a perspective on group core growth guidance in Q3. Given the Q2 impacts, we see LDG growing mid-single digits and both ACG and AMG growing low single digits. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.35 and $1.37 representing growth of 2.3% to 3.8%. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Padraig for closing comments.\nPadraig McDonnell: Before I close, I want to thank our retiring Board member, Heidi Kunz, for many years of service with Agilent. And I want to welcome Pascal Soriot and Judy Gawlik Brown to the Board. Pascal is CEO of AstraZeneca, and Judy is currently Founder and CEO of Downtown Advisory after holding senior leadership positions at Amgen and Perrigo. Both bring decades of global leadership experience from the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare sectors, with a proven track record in strategy, innovation, operations and finance. I look forward to working with you both. It's an exciting time to be part of the Agilent growth story, to be part of building on our foundational strength of being an established leader in $80 billion markets driven by secular growth, having leading market share and sustainable competitive advantage through our intense customer focus and reaccelerating growth through innovation and market share gains. And we continue to look at the long term. As Bob mentioned, we have a strong balance sheet and remain focused on augmenting our internal innovation with external growth opportunities. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities of all sizes that are aligned with our strategy we explained in December and will further build this great company. In a highly dynamic macro environment, Agilent is excelling. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year 2025 commitments and in our long term trajectory towards financial framework we explained at Investor Day. With Ignite scaling and our pace of innovation accelerating, Agilent is well positioned to outperform regardless of the near term market dynamics. After one year as CEO, I'm even more energized by what we're accomplishing at Agilent, and we're only getting started. Thank you for your attention. I'll now hand it over to Parmeet to kick off our Q and A.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Maybe one just on the order trends that you guys saw in the quarter. Can you just give us some color how those progressed as the quarter progressed? I mean, you guys are unique with the timing, probably saw a little bit of the pharma tariffs, the actual tariffs come in. Just curious, if you're willing to talk about April, certainly, May would be welcomed as well. But what you saw on the order front? Did you see any pull forward around the pharma tariffs? I know you talked about the ACG pull forward on the consumables. But just curious what you're hearing from customers? And again, what you thought on the order front versus the revenue side would be helpful as well.\nPadraig McDonnell: So first of all, book to bill was greater than 1 and our orders grew low single digits in Q2. And overall for the first half orders grew mid-single digits. So in terms of any pull forward from Pharma, we haven't seen anything. We've seen actually very stable business across the regions of course as Bob talked about in the script. We did see a pull forward in consumables that comes out in the wash given some of the issues we had with customs etc. in April, but that's back to normal now. So what I would say is peak pharma customers are in particular still spending on key projects. The replacement cycle continues and so no changes there. And we do expect this gradual recovery to continue in the second half.\nPatrick Donnelly: And then maybe just on the NASD BIOVECTRA piece, it sounds like those performed quite well in the quarter. Can you talk about expectations for the rest of your, it sounds like NASD is maybe creeping a little bit higher, which is great. Can you talk about the visibility there? I know sometimes you get orders well out a few quarters. I mean, are you into ‘26 on some of these order books? Maybe just talk about the visibility and what you're seeing in those businesses would be helpful.\nPadraig McDonnell: I'll start and I'll hand it over to Simon. So first of all, really, really pleased by the progress in our CDMO business and NASD with high single digit growth and with BIOVECTRA in the high teens. We're seeing the combination of these businesses right in the sweet spot of really important therapeutic areas coming together. But I'll hand it over to Simon for more color on that.\nSimon May: I'd say overall in the CDMO businesses we were pleased on a couple of major fronts for the quarter just past. We saw progression of some early commercial programs in the NASD business. We've talked about that a few times previously. We're now starting to see the revenue mix there evolve more from 50/50 towards 60/40 in favor of commercial. We think that bodes well for the future. And then in the BIOVECTRA business, there was also some really noticeable progress. Our GLP-1 manufacturing programs, we saw successful scale up there. We saw some nice process efficiency gains. And that's now beginning to become a pretty meaningful contributor to the CDMO business overall. As we think about going forward in the near term, I'd say we're pretty confident about the second half of the year as we look at NASD. In particular, we've got very clear line of sight to the double digit growth that was mentioned in the script. I'd say we've got the orders in house that we need to fulfill that. And then longer term, we continue to think we're extremely well positioned in this space. And again, these combined capabilities of NASD and BIOVECTRA really put us in the sweet spot of advanced therapeutic modalities and particular areas that really excites us like oligos and antibody drug conjugates. And bioconjugation generally is a really high growth area where we've got real strong capability in BIOVECTRA. So a lot to be pleased about in the quarter. As always, I'd caveat it. This business is lumpy. It will continue to be lumpy, but we're on a clear upward trajectory here. We feel like we're nicely positioned and we got a good line of sight to the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to follow-up on Patrick's first question just around the in quarter impact you saw on ordering just around the tariffs. The $15 million of consumables that got pulled forward, what were you hearing from customers as to just the reason for why that happened? Just curious about that. And then on the instrument side, does the guide assume you recapture that in the fiscal third quarter? Or do you think that could come later in the year?\nRobert W. McMahon: Jack, this is Bob. I'll take that. And as you can imagine, in China, given the high tariff rates that were being proposed at the time of mid-April, there was a desire to try to get ahead of that from some of our customers and we had inventory in-country. And so we just saw some stocking of orders that would normally be throughout Q3 being pulled into Q2 and being delivered. On the flip side, because of the changing tariffs, there were a number of longer delivery times and logistics activities that were happening at the ports in China as well that primarily impacted our instrument business because we bring those in. And so that offset in total in China. And so when we look at that, we would expect no change. We didn't see any change to our overall revenue in Q2, just some moves between instruments and consumables. And that will reverse itself we expect here in Q3. But again, in total for Q2 and Q3 the total results, are fine.\nJack Meehan: Got it. That makes sense. And I think that explains where I was going to go with my second question as to why China was much better than I was thinking. So I do have one other follow-up, which is, Bob, just can you boil it all down now on the margin side for the year, kind of what the guide implies for operating margin?\nRobert W. McMahon: So the margin, given obviously the cost associated with the incremental tariffs, we are covering that with a combination of tariff mitigation activities as well as some pricing surcharges and then some of the Ignite. But given the impact of that, it will be closer to flat versus year ago. If you took that out, we would still be on track for the margin expansion similar to what we saw here in Q2 as an example. So we were flat year on year. But if you took out that 55 basis points, we've been right on track. So we still feel good about that cadence going forward, particularly when we talk about 2026. When we talk about mitigations, that means that we will eliminate the gross impact of the tariffs through some of the supply chain moves that are already ongoing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: In the past you've noted that the majority of your exposure within your pharma business is in clinical versus earlier stage research. Have you seen any differences between the ordering patterns of these two applications, especially with the recent uncertainty in the research spend from these customers?\nPadraig McDonnell: No, I would say the lion's share of our business is actually on the QAQC and development side and we saw small molecule actually grow 10% in the quarter which was a fantastic result. So we see across pharma that actually that's the part that's more resilient currently and particularly in the future where you see potential reshoring that may happen over a few years of course. QAQC testing benefits from that and of course benefits by the way from supply chain changes with pharma around the globe as they look to mitigate things themselves. So overall, I would say a very strong quarter on that side and we continue to expect. We do actually of course serve our customers on the R&D side and the development side, but the vast majority would be on the QAQC side.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then within PFAS, we've seen some potential easing of regulation within water in the US. Have you seen this impact orders as customers work through the uncertainty? And then how much can growth in food and product testing offset potential weakness in the water regulation?\nPadraig McDonnell: So first of all, just a tremendous result in PFAS in Q2. We grew 75% year-over-year and also saw tremendous growth around consumables and connect rates with our systems. Just to give a little bit of color as well, Europe and China led really grew well and of course with EMEA. So lots to like about us. If you think about some of the recent announcements, it's hard to get some of the details in those announcements with the restructuring that's going on. But I think you're going to see the water testing continue over the next few quarters especially in the broader area outside the US. I think the larger part of our PFAS business in the US over the next year or the next half is going to come from industrial based testing that's around wastewater silent discharges. That's where you see people worried about litigation. You'll see a lot from the EPA coming out to pay for any infringements. So we also see that material testing globally and water testing in EMEA, APAC to drive business over the next two quarters. So I would say we're expecting very strong results for the year, but beyond the year extremely strong as well. There's also one emerging thing that's coming up quite a bit is that PFAS testing is going to start more into air and volatile PFAS, which is right in our sweet spot for GCMS. Currently, that's about, I would say, 2% to 3% of the market. But over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect that to go to 8% to 12% of the market where we will have a very high market share win rate on that. So that gives the color on PFAS.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: I want to follow-up on your comments there and Evie's question regarding reshoring. You've had a few of your peers call this out as a potential tailwind, just given the number of capacity announcements that we've heard from pharma companies in recent months. Can you walk us through, have you had any concrete conversations with customers regarding these capacity build outs? And how do we think about the timing of when we could see any tailwinds related to onshoring?\nPadraig McDonnell: Having spent three decades in this industry and actually the earlier parts of those decades in Ireland when there was a lot of pharmaceutical being built in Ireland in terms of capacity. Generally, the way these things happen, it takes quite a bit of time. What we're leading with is our strategic account program. So we're at the very highest levels with our pharma customers. Discussions are extremely early. So I wouldn't say any concrete out of that yet. But generally what happens is you see the plans for the site being put up. You also see qualification plans for the site. Generally construction tenders are out. And then from the construction tenders people think about lab capacity and that is the point which is really critical to be in and we feel very good about our position with the strategic accounts. Also by the way you hear of methods moving early so maybe it moves from EMEA to the US. So we find out from our large installed bases where those methods are going to go. But we don't expect anything. I would say you're going to see something maybe at the end of two to three years. But it will be a tailwind for us given the amount of systems and also the proportion of QAQC in those systems.\nRachel Vatnsdal: And then just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on pricing. Can you talk about your ability to pass on price in this environment given the dynamic environment that we're seeing in light of tariffs? And in general, what's embedded for pricing for the rest of the year and for guidance?\nPadraig McDonnell: I'll take the first part and I'll give the second part to Bob on it. So we have enterprise pricing capability that we build through Ignite. So we do surcharges in a very structured way. Clearly we're looking at our competitive situation around in different regions and making sure we're staying focused on the customers. So based on the work we're already optimizing our pricing and we have- it has been quite a big part of our mitigation going forward. But Bob, don't know if you want talk about guide?\nRobert W. McMahon: To build on what Padraig said, just to reiterate what we said in the prepared remarks, we've already achieved what we achieved all of last year through the first six months of this. So a very good performance there. If you recall, in our guide, we had about 100 basis points of price. We're on track for that for the year, probably a little bit higher with the pricing mitigation activities that are being established as a result of tariffs. As you can imagine, depending on the competitive nature there, the type of pricing that we would have vis-a-vis the supply chain activities, which would be a permanent mitigation, we're balancing all of those as well as the Ignite savings activities as well. So we are not taking all of the mitigation from tariffs out of price. We think that is something that will help us with our customers as well. And looking to move things around to have what we would call internally kind of no regrets moves to be able to manage our supply chain globally, given the dynamic nature of how these rates are moving back and forth. So that's kind of how we're thinking about the second half of the year. And again, in 2026, we would expect to have all of the tariff rates being mitigated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: First one on the replacement cycle, you talked about book to bill being more than 1. Just trying to understand how should we think about the Infinity III replacement cycle? How is it doing in the environmental labs versus the pharma labs? What are you seeing in the field? Early traction? Maybe just help us understand how should we think about the anatomy of this replacement cycle for Agilent?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I'd be happy go through some details. So the Infinity III ramp continues extremely well. We see a lot of very strong adoption and customer feedback continues to be very positive. Our order funnel is really growing nicely with the Infinity III and we're really pleased with market acceptance. What we're actually seeing with Infinity III on the replacement cycle is we're seeing actually a higher connect rate in service and consumers with that system, which really bodes well for the future. But overall replacement cycles on the LC side, I'll focus on that first and then maybe talk to the broader portfolio. We've been seeing a continuous ramp on that. We expect that to continue over the next few quarters. We have thousands of 1100s. We have 1260s, 1290s. We're moving through that replacement cycle. But of course, it doesn't happen in one quarter. It doesn't happen sequentially quarter after quarter. You see it gradually build. And generally, I would say the funnel to close is about six to nine months to close an LC order. So we continue to see that increase, but very pleased with the adoption. And of course, there's a much broader continuum around our replacement cycle given our GC, GCMS and our LCMS installed bases that are already I think continuing to start to replace.\nRobert W. McMahon: Hey, Padraig, just to reiterate some of the proof points that you talked about when we talk about small molecule QAQC, which is the lion's share of installed base that grew double digits in Q2 from a revenue, all in inclusive of service consumables and instrumentation. So it speaks to the full workflow solution. And to your question about environmental, that's our sweet spot and we grew in PFAS over 70%. So I think it can kind of tells how well that's being adopted in the environmental space as well.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. And my follow-up is, can you size how much of the China growth in the quarter was from the sort of the Lunar New Year timing perspective, how Lunar New Year played out this year versus last year versus the sort of the consumable pull forward that you saw? And what was the China stimulus in the quarter?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah, I'll start on that Puneet. So the pull forward of the consumables that we were talking about actually had nothing to do with Lunar New Year. It was really driven by the tariffs. So that I think is an idiosyncratic activity that wouldn't continue. The Lunar New Year played out the way we expected it to for the full year guide. So there's roughly about 2 points of total company when you look at the change year on year and it kind of played out the way we expected it to. And so if you look at our revenue dollars in China sequentially, it's actually a very good performance, still well above $300 million speaks to the stability in that market. And in terms of the last question that you had around stimulus, we continue to be pleased about the performance. If you looked at the applied markets, we had some very good performance in food, some of the other implied markets. Most of our stimulus was actually in Q1, but we're very optimistic about the funnel activity right now for the next stimulus, which we are starting to work with our customers and putting together bids for the second half of this year, probably will be revenue at the end of our calendar year here potentially in Q4 that would be upside. If it is in Q4, we haven't built that into our numbers. But feel very optimistic about our ability to do that given our made in China capabilities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: My first one on the guidance here. You look at ACG, think ex the pull forward, it was still a pretty healthy six plus, maybe high singles kind of number. Why is it slowing down to low singles? I think you said in 3Q. And when you apply that to overall company, right, I think it's stepping down by 250 basis points sequentially. I know like on a year on year basis like the comps maybe explains that. But on a stack comp basis, it looks maybe a little conservative. So maybe talk about the third quarter assumptions.\nAngelica Riemann: Thanks for the question. I think coming back to the tariff related consumables pull forward, right, we made those adjustments. And so once we make those adjustments for the quarter on quarter growth rates and normalize them, the guide is in the mid-single digit range. So that's really accounting for it. But when you look more holistically, the fundamentals of ACG remain incredibly strong as we look towards the rest of the year. We're well positioned to continue to support customers as they're maximizing the assets in their laboratory through the broad portfolio, whether that's consumables, services as well as some of the other offerings in the ECG portfolio. So we just adjusted and still a healthy growth rate across ECG for full year.\nVijay Kumar: Then maybe one on the P&L. I think on the margins, I thought I heard you say gross margins was in line. It looks like versus Street, maybe numbers came down. Sequentially, gross margins were down. Maybe talk about what happened on gross margins, was that a mix impact? And I think you had a restructuring charge, which wasn't there in prior quarters. Is this some new cost actions that hasn't been initiated?\nRobert W. McMahon: When we were talking about the gross margins, if you look at it year on year, we did have the unplanned tariff activity, which was about 55 basis points in gross margin that hit in Q2. If you look at it versus year ago, there was a combination of tariffs, product mix, which we had incorporated as well as some currency related activities. So feel good about kind of where that is. In terms of restructuring, that's probably more on a GAAP basis, Vijay. And we would have taken that out for the numbers that I was just referencing on a non-GAAP basis. But that would have been part of some of the organizational health activities that Padraig had mentioned as part of Ignite.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: I want to go back to NASD. The comps get easier here in the back half. So presumably double digit growth. Could that business be double digit for the full year? Or should we think about high single digit for NASD? Also, can you talk about capacity utilization as we think about Trane C and D and then also BIOVECTRA full finish? And then third question on that is just with the onshoring theme, are you seeing more interest from pharma given that most of that business is US and then some in Canada? Has that kind of peaked and then picked up interest from some pharma companies?\nSimon May: So as we think about the back end of the year and NASD and we've been saying all along that we envision high single digit growth and nudging double digit growth. I'd say there's a growing confidence that we think we can nudge that double digit growth as we look at the forecast that we're seeing begin to crystallize for Q3 and Q4. And then as far as BIOVECTRA goes, I think we're going to see a sequential dip in the third quarter. We're looking at some planned equipment shutdowns there. And as those come online again, which we anticipate in Q4, provided that all goes to plan, then I think we'll be back to firing on all cylinders where that's concerned. As for Train C and Train D, we've been through this dynamic for a while now where we were coming through the back end of the IRA impacts and then we started to see our order intake really improve in 2024. That's continued through to 2025. Again, I think we've got pretty much all of the orders in hand now to deliver on 2025. So that utilization of Train C, Train D is starting to become another positive tailwind driver for us now.\nPadraig McDonnell: And I would say we haven't seen any impact at all from potential tariffs on pharma etc. reshoring or shifts at all in that business in any conversations we have with our pharma.\nTycho Peterson: And then follow-up on replacement cycle. I appreciate the commentary and color you gave previously. Are you able to give us what percentage of LC systems are Infinity III at this point? Is it 15%, 20% of the mix? And then you haven't talked much about the GC replacement cycle. You did kind of allude to that. How are you thinking about that as well?\nPadraig McDonnell: It's steadily growing. I mean we're six months into the launch or a little bit more than that on the Infinity III. So it's building over time, but we don't give out the exact percentage of our installed base on that one. But I can assure you it's going extremely well, Tycho. And given what we're seeing on the cadence from our older systems and even up to the 1260s and 1290s customers are really voting for the Infinity III when they replace. But I'm going to ask Mike Zhang here on the GC replacement cycle.\nMike Zhang: We're the leader in the GC and also GCMS and we have a very large installed base and we're working with our customers. And I can tell you, yes, we have a large installed base. We have some very significant AGS installed base as well. We're actually very excited to see some very strong momentum with our customers, well, the GC and also GCMS. If you look at our order pace, think it's very encouraging. And we also have been exciting new innovations. We just launched the new GC and we have other exciting innovations as well. What I can tell is in the next few quarters, next few years, we're going to see a significant opportunity coming to materialize.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Couillard: Bob, you took down the operating cash flow guide for the year. Is that driven by tariffs and maybe inventory builds? And could you quantify the impact of currency on EPS in 2Q and then what's embedded for the full year now?\nRobert W. McMahon: You are spot on, and from a cash flow perspective, that is, in fact, what we have done is looked at building inventory, which is impacting our cash flow. It's kind of a onetime activity as well as some capital equipment as well as building up. We didn't change our overall capital forecast, but there is some working capital there as well. So that's what we have. In terms of the EPS, it's close to about a point or two from an EPS standpoint for the full year impact, Brandon. And we can get you the details post call.\nBrandon Couillard: Big picture, the balance sheet is very clean right now. Are you less likely to consider a larger deal right now given the macro, tariffs, interest rate volatility? Or are you seeing more attractive valuations for assets? And how do you think about those trade-offs?\nPadraig McDonnell: We don't make any decisions based on the news that we see every week around how we're going to deploy capital going forward. But I can say a few things. We have a very strong list of opportunities. It's wedded in our strategy. So we have done a lot of work on that. Of course valuations are down a little bit, but of course we're going to remain very disciplined in what we do going forward. But I will say that M&A will become a bigger part of our story over the next few years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: I'll focus both on the margins and sort of the cadence through the year. Bob, you talked a lot about the impact of tariffs on 2Q, the 55 bps. But just looking at the gross margin guide, not the guide, but the implied number is kind of flat for throughout the rest of the year, maybe down 100 bps year-over-year. So the implied OpEx step up in 3Q and 4Q especially, it seems like it's coming off from the SG&A side. Could you just talk through how much of that is- whether that's volume leverage or the Ignite transformation coming through?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. It's a little of both. As you could probably imagine, if you look at our kind of normal seasonality kind of first half to second half, we do have a step up in margin. Some of that's related to volume. We also have more holidays and lower spending in the second half of the year. And then you've got the full impact of Ignite transformation that Padraig talked about. We talked about this $80 million of annualized, $40 million of that will happen here in the second half of the year, which will help us offset some of the tariffs. So you're right, more of our margin improvement in the second half was actually going to show up in the OpEx because tariffs show up in the gross margin. And so we've got some mitigation at the gross margin side, but also the mitigation activities in the OpEx side as well.\nMichael Ryskin: And then on the tariff side, your point on, like you just said, partially offsetting as you go through the year on gross side, but then fully offsetting in 2026. So how do we think about gross margins either as a percent or whatever for 2026? Like what's the right jumping off point? Because optically, you're going to have a really easy compare of 54.5%, 55% for the year, but a lot of that is artificially depressed. So are we going to expect like a nice gross margin jump in '26 because those offsets and that mitigation kicks in for next year?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. I would say, if I could forecast what tariffs are going to be here by '26, that would be something. But that being said, if they stayed the way they are, I would expect us to be able to have an improved gross margin next year for a couple of reasons. One is exactly what you just talked about. The gross will be eliminated. It's not just a mitigation, will eliminate it through the resourcing or reshoring of our supply chain. You'll have the benefit of volume as well. And then we also talked about the pricing capabilities that we would expect to have more price next year through price realization than we had here as a result of some of the pricing capabilities that Padraig talked about. So still early days, so we're not giving guidance here for 2026, but certainly, there's some opportunities more from a tailwind perspective in gross margin going into 2026.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDan Leonard: I was hoping you could perhaps elaborate on trends you're seeing in China by end markets. I think you mentioned industrials was down low single digits, but just elsewhere between pharma, environmental, etc.?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So I think in China, we've seen a pretty very stable business. I mean, except for that pull forward on us, I would say that you see that industrials are down a little bit, but pharma is pretty stable. And I would say that there's a lot of excitement I would say building in China around the second phase of the stimulus, which is going to be more broader based. It's actually going to be more much more broader based than it was the last time the funnels are looking extremely strong for that. But I would say overall it's stable.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes, I would agree. If you look across, pharma, academia, government, food and environmental forensics were up. Diagnostics clinical to our smallest market was flat and then CAM was down just slightly. And some of that had to do with some of the instrumentation delays through customs that happened. Now you may ask why in China, because actually even though it was made in China, that has to go through a bonded warehouse and that still has to go through customs and it actually takes a little longer time. So no custom no tariff impact from that standpoint, but it still required going through customs. And so we expect that to come back here in Q3.\nDan Leonard: And then Bob, a follow-up on Q3 guidance overall. It looks like the midpoint of organic revenue growth is about 2% and that is a sequential step down from the 5% you just reported. I know there's some China timing issue there, but can you walk me through the main bridge factors between the Q2 result and the lower Q3 guide?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. So a couple of things. We think we're taking a prudent approach given some of the still uncertainty in the tariff announcements here. Feel very good about our momentum going into Q3. And we also have a little more difficult comp in Q3 than we have Q2. So I wouldn't read too much into it when I look at sequential numbers in Q3 versus Q2.\nOperator: And Mr. Ahuja, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Regina. And thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. With that, we'd like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

The press release for our second quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth is adjusted for the impact of currency exchange rates and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past twelve months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we implemented certain changes to our reporting structure related to the reorganization of our three business segments. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes and have provided the financial details on our website. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Agilent delivered strong second quarter results in a highly dynamic market environment. Revenue of $1.67 billion for the second quarter represented growth of 6% reported and up 5.3% core compared with the second quarter of 2024. Operating margin was a solid 25.1% as we absorbed some incremental tariff costs. We also delivered EPS of $1.31 growing 7% compared with the second quarter of 2024. Both revenue and EPS exceeded our expectations, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. Our performance was driven by growth across markets and regions, speaking to the diversity of our business. We also saw another quarter of building momentum in Instruments with our book to bill ratio again greater than one. Thank you to the Agilent team for delivering these results by tirelessly going above and beyond for our customers. No matter where I travel in the world, our customers consistently say the same thing. The Agilent team is second to none and for that reason, they want to increase their partnership and collaboration with us even more, even during a challenging macro environment. These conditions have proved the efficacy of our three year Ignite transformation, which is the execution of our strategy. We're already leveraging Ignite to create an enterprise operating model that has resulted in multiple early wins, including tariff mitigation. More on that in a moment. First, let me tell you why our Q2 was so strong. All regions grew in the quarter. Americas grew low single digits. EMEA grew mid-single digits. And China led the way at 10% growth, exceeding our expectation, while the rest of Asia grew high single digits. China saw stable demand conditions sequentially, while a favorable Lunar New Year comparison helped year on year growth. In Asia, India delivered high teens growth. India is a long term high growth innovation driven market, which is why we've opened our first India solution center there this month. The center showcases Agilent's expertise across disciplines to deliver end to end solutions in sectors such as GLP-1 analysis, emerging food and environmental contaminant analysis and PFAS detection. We also delivered mid to high single digit growth in all end markets except academia and government, which declined modestly with strong results in Asia moderating the expected softness in the US. Pharma grew 6% at the high end of expectations, led by small molecule growing low double digits. Biopharma continues to recover at a slower pace, growing low single digits as we continue to see funding challenges in small and mid-sized biotech, primarily in the US. Within biopharma, NASD was a standout growing high single digits in Q2, and we're looking forward to double digit growth from NASD in the second half of the year. In addition, while not yet part of core growth, our BIOVECTRA business performed well, exceeding guidance. BIOVECTRA's capabilities are in the sweet spot of tremendous markets, for example, GLP-1s and complex chemistries, with terrific medium and long term growth potential. We are very excited about the combined offerings of NASD and BIOVECTRA. Diagnostics and Clinical grew 8%, ahead of expectations, on strong performance of our pathology business in The Americas and Europe. Environmental and Forensics grew 6% on strong PFAS testing demand globally. PFAS testing remains strong for Agilent globally, and we see it continuing to expand into other end markets, such as food and chemical and advanced materials. In Q2, PFAS grew more than 70% year-over-year globally, with Europe and China more than doubling their business. PFAS provided an incremental 80 basis points to our growth in the quarter and is now annualizing to well over $100 million. We continue to be very optimistic about the long term growth prospects globally in PFAS as regulations and standards continue to be put in place. For PFAS testing, our Infinity III and our 6495D system is the most sensitive and robust solution. The Agilent team has deep understanding of customer challenges and how we can help them with their testing needs through delivering integrated workflow solutions, productivity and new modality application development. We are tracking over 350 regulations globally and are very confident in the continued momentum in this emerging $1 billion addressable market by 2030. In Chemicals and Advanced Materials, revenue grew 4% with high single digit growth in Advanced Materials, while Chemical and Energy was up low single digits globally. Overall, we saw growth ex-China offset by low single digit decline in China. Lower oil prices are net positive to the CAM business given it drives lower input prices to our chemical business, which is four times bigger than energy. Food grew 8%, benefiting from strength in Asia through government funded technology refresh. Our smallest end markets, academia and government, declined only 2% in the quarter, better than expected performance in the US and globally. Given we were ahead of others talking about potential US funding impacts in our first quarter earnings call and did better than expected in Q2, we feel we already have adequately captured any variability looking forward. When looking holistically across Agilent, we continue to make investments in our digital ecosystem, such as our next generation e-commerce platform, so that we can offer an outstanding customer experience. Those investments are paying off as we grew digital orders by 12% year-over-year to $295 million. I also want to highlight ACG's 9% growth this quarter, which exceeded expectations. ACG's performance was led by strong growth in automation, services and consumables. For the first time in several quarters, we saw both on demand and installation services return to growth. These results keep us on track with the long term commitments we outlined at our Analyst and Investor Day in December, including 5% to 7% core revenue growth, expanding margins 50 to 100 plus basis points annually and driving double digit EPS growth. We have momentum at Agilent. Over the past 12 months, my first year as CEO, the Agilent team has accomplished a lot. We built a formidable senior leadership team that is working in lockstep to maximize Agilent's resources to drive shareholder value. We've evolved our enterprise strategy to be market first and realigned our businesses to our markets. We acquired BIOVECTRA for roughly $1 billion to expand our CDMO capabilities, and we have moved from planning to execution in Ignite. Before providing further details on Ignite, I want to pause here and thank our Agilent team members for how quickly they have adapted to change and the company's higher ambition. It is no small feat to transform a company, and I've been impressed by our colleagues' passion for our mission and vision and their increased seals to delight customers so that Agilent continues to win in the market. These team members are leading Ignite, an initiative that is already yielding incredible results. Those incredible results include strengthening our strategic pricing capabilities and implementing enterprise wide pricing initiatives. In six months, we already have exceeded the full year price contribution from last year and are expecting at least 100 basis points of price realization in 2025, with expectations for an even greater impact in 2026 and beyond improving organization agility and efficiency by flattening management layers and increasing spans of control by 30% to improve our organization health and become a nimbler company. Additionally, we expect this to deliver annualized savings of about $80 million starting in the second half of the fiscal year. Centralizing our procurement under a Chief Procurement Officer and adopting an integrated enterprise wide approach to vendor management, we already see strong momentum exceeding our internal savings targets, ramping in the second half of this year while being essential in mitigating tariff expense with our suppliers. This is with projected procurement annualized savings exceeding $50 million by the end of 2025 and establishing a strong foundation for additional gains in 2026. Ignite has become the backbone of our operating system, enabling faster decision making, more scalable growth and over $130 million of profit for fiscal year 2025. It is our institutional engine for long term value creation. Center to value creation is our continued commitment to innovation. I'm proud to share three impactful new products that demonstrate that commitment. In our cell analysis portfolio, we just launched the Seahorse XF Flex analyzer. With its world class leading sensitivity, versatility, intuitive design and compatibility with 3D models, the XF Flex empowers more researchers than ever before to explore cellular metabolism with confidence. And at the 73rd ASMS conference next week, we will launch our latest innovation in liquid chromatography mass detection. Our new InfinityLab Pro iQ series offers unparalleled sensitivity, speed and efficiency, making it the ideal choice for customers analyzing complex biomolecules in settings where performance and lab productivity are key. At ASMS, we will also showcase our enhanced 8850-GC, now coupled with the power of our market leading DCMS that enables our customers to do more with less. We've reduced the 8850’s footprint by 50% and increased throughput up to 5x by lowering its energy usage by 45% compared with a conventional benchtop GC. We also continue to have success with our Infinity III LC in orders, funnel and our attach rates of service and consumables. We're seeing this success both geographically with robust growth in India, a particular highlight, and across all end markets, with our top customers calling out the Infinity III's superior performance, intelligence and task automation capabilities. To help further drive Agilent's internal and external innovation engine, I'm delighted to announce August Specht is joining Agilent next month as our Chief Technology Officer. August has spent over 25 years in senior R&D roles in the life sciences industry. Welcome, August. Ignite also gave us a significant head start on tariff mitigation, enabling the immediate creation of our tariff task force that has allowed us to make changes that will maintain our market strength regardless of tariff rates. We are proactively managing tariff exposure by taking several targeted actions, including focusing on specific product lines and production sites rather than adopting a one size fits all approach further diversifying our supply chain by leveraging our extensive global sourcing capabilities and manufacturing network, ensuring we're geographically even closer to customers implementing strategic pricing initiatives around the globe that protect our market competitiveness. While we remain vigilant amid geopolitical developments, our localized manufacturing, proactive tariff mitigation and a diversified customer base gives us greater resilience and agility globally than many of our peers. Through our tariff task force enabled by our Ignite operating model, we feel that we are able to mitigate most of the impact in 2025 and fully mitigate in 2026, even when considering recent developments on the US-EU tariffs. With the task force, we can create targeted analytics in a matter of hours, not days, that identify key supply chain and commercial opportunities that will allow us to maximize our tariff mitigation efforts. Our top priority is ensuring we minimize tariff impacts on our customers and that our customers have the trusted Agilent products, solutions and services they need. Looking ahead, we are confident that the long term fundamentals and secular growth drivers of our markets remain strong. For the year, we are maintaining our core growth rate of 2.5% to 3.5%, while incorporating favorable currency movements. By leveraging our Ignite program, we are fully absorbing all unmitigated FY 2025 tariff costs and maintaining our full year EPS guidance. While our results this quarter exceeded expectations, we believe it's important to remain disciplined in our outlook given the ongoing uncertainty in the macro environment and geopolitical landscape. We are committed to maintaining guidance that is both credible and achievable, and we continue to prioritize long term value creation. Bob will now share further details about our Q2 and guidance.\nRobert W. McMahon: Thanks, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our full year and third quarter guidance. As Padraig mentioned, Q2 revenue was $1.67 billion above the high end of our guidance. On a core basis, we posted growth of 5.3%, while reported growth was 6%. Currency had a negative impact of 1.6%, which was 0.5 point better than estimated as the dollar weakened during the quarter. M&A also contributed 2.3%, coming in nicely ahead of expectations. Now let me talk about our performance by business group. The Agilent CrossLab Group reported revenue of $713 million, growing 9%, which was ahead of our expectations. Double digit growth in consumables and automation and high single digit growth in services drove ACG's performance. Our life sciences and diagnostics market group reported revenue of $654 million in the quarter, growing 3%. Core growth was driven by our pathology business and NASD, both of which delivered high single digit growth and our LC and LCMS instruments that grew mid-single digits. Our cell analysis business returned to growth, up low single digits. Performance was partially offset by an expected mid-single digit decline in our NGS business. And our applied markets group reported $301 million in the quarter, flat versus last year on a core growth basis. Growth in spectroscopy and GCMS was offset by some timing related declines in gas chromatography. Before getting into the rest of the P&L, I want to cover additional details on Q2 revenue that were influenced by the April tariff announcements, primarily in China. While there was no revenue impact to Agilent overall, we did see some shifts by group in the quarter. Specifically, we saw roughly $15 million of in country ACG lab consumables revenue pulled forward into Q2 from Q3. However, this was offset by longer processing time through customs on some select instrumentation in both AMG and LGG. Again, this did not impact our overall revenue for Q2 or our Q3 outlook, but we have taken that into account by group looking forward, which I'll talk to in a minute. It is also important to note we've seen a return to normal customs processing times here in May. Now let's move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 54.1% in the quarter, roughly in line with our expectations after accounting for 55 basis points of incremental tariff costs. It is down versus last year, with the delta being equally distributed among tariffs, currency and product mix. We drove operating margins of 25.1%. While flat versus last year, excluding the 55 basis points of incremental tariffs, it would have been an increase year on year. So overall, a strong showing. Below the line, we had $2 million of income, while our tax rate of 11.5% was better than expected. And we had 285 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.31 That was ahead of our expectations and up 7% from a year ago, growing faster than core revenue. This is a very good result in the face of the dynamic macro environment, which is a testament to the Agilent team forging close collaborative partnerships with our customers. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $221 million in the quarter, and we invested $114 million in capital expenditures. We purchased $165 million in shares and paid out $70 million in dividends during the quarter. And we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1, so we continue to have a very strong balance sheet. Now let's move on to our outlook for the fiscal year and third quarter. As Padraig mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our core growth outlook for the year and increasing our reported revenue guidance by $50 million to reflect incremental FX benefit since our last guide. This results in an increase to our full year reported revenue to be in the range of $6.73 billion to $6.81 billion, increasing reported growth to 3.4% to 4.6%. Currency is now expected to represent a 1.1 percentage point headwind for the year versus a prior 1.9% headwind, while our M&A guidance is unchanged at plus 2% to 2.2% revenue impact for the year. Core growth is still expected to be between 2.5% to 3.5% for the year. We believe this is a prudent way to manage considering the dynamic macro environment. Now to help you with your models, I wanted to provide some additional perspective on our end markets. In pharma, we are monitoring the progress of US pricing policy proposals, but are not seeing a change in customer behavior. As a result, we continue to expect low to mid-single digit growth for the year, with the second half of the year continuing to show steady improvement versus the first half. For Diagnostics and Clinical, given Q2's performance, we now expect growth to be towards the upper end of mid-single digits. And we expect growth for both Chemicals and Advanced Materials and Food to continue to be in the range of low to mid-single digits, while the environmental and forensics market is a solid mid-single digit growth on PFAS strength. And lastly, as a reminder, academia and government is our smallest market at 8% of total revenue, with NIH related research representing only about 1% of revenue. We are maintaining our outlook from Q1 of a mid-single digit decline in total, with the US market being the driver. While we performed much better than we expected in Q2, we feel this is a prudent approach for the year. We are also maintaining our full year EPS guidance of $5.54 to $5.61 while covering the incremental tariff costs that I'll explain in more detail in a moment. This represents a year on year increase of 4.7% to 6%. For clarity, let me briefly summarize the tariff assumptions we've incorporated into our FY '25 guidance. Based on the tariff rates that are currently in place, we estimate that the gross incremental tariff exposure in the second half of our fiscal year is $50 million. This is on top of the roughly $10 million we have already absorbed in the first half of our fiscal year. 30% of the exposure is represented by trade between the US and China, about evenly split. Of the remaining 70%, thirty percentage points is from the EU into the US, and the remaining 40% is from the rest of the world into the US. As Padraig mentioned, we have mobilized our team using the Ignite operating model to quickly move our procurement and supply chains to minimize the tariffs and build inventory. We are using a combination of supply chain moves, like moving LC production into the US, surcharges and some of the Ignite driven savings that Padraig previously highlighted to offset the incremental costs. Importantly, we expect our actions to fully mitigate the costs in fiscal 2026. The tariff landscape continues to be dynamic and hard to predict. However, given the recent news of potentially increasing tariffs on EU sourced products to 50% as early as July 9, we felt it important to frame that exposure. If implemented on July 9, we estimate that would add another $40 million in gross exposure in the second half of the year. But through additional pricing mitigations and the inventory we've built up, we anticipate the net impact would be minimal for the year. This is the power of our tariff task force. It enables us to address tariffs at the enterprise level and align Agilent's key senior leaders so we can quickly leverage our strong and diverse supply chain footprint and adjust to the market driven approach of our unified commercial team. Finally, for your modeling, we are now projecting an increase in other income and expenses to $15 million in income, along with a 12% tax rate for the year and 285 million diluted shares outstanding. Moving to the third quarter, we are guiding to revenue of $1.645 billion to $1.675 billion. This range represents an increase of 1.7% to 3.6% growth on a core basis and an increase of 4.2% to 6.1% growth on a reported basis. Currency is a 0.6% tailwind, and M&A impact is expected to be a 1.9% benefit in the quarter. Again, while the Q2 stocking and logistics dynamics I mentioned earlier do not affect the total revenue in Q3, we do see it playing out differently by group. For that reason, we thought it helpful to provide a perspective on group core growth guidance in Q3. Given the Q2 impacts, we see LDG growing mid-single digits and both ACG and AMG growing low single digits. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.35 and $1.37 representing growth of 2.3% to 3.8%. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Padraig for closing comments.\nPadraig McDonnell: Before I close, I want to thank our retiring Board member, Heidi Kunz, for many years of service with Agilent. And I want to welcome Pascal Soriot and Judy Gawlik Brown to the Board. Pascal is CEO of AstraZeneca, and Judy is currently Founder and CEO of Downtown Advisory after holding senior leadership positions at Amgen and Perrigo. Both bring decades of global leadership experience from the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare sectors, with a proven track record in strategy, innovation, operations and finance. I look forward to working with you both. It's an exciting time to be part of the Agilent growth story, to be part of building on our foundational strength of being an established leader in $80 billion markets driven by secular growth, having leading market share and sustainable competitive advantage through our intense customer focus and reaccelerating growth through innovation and market share gains. And we continue to look at the long term. As Bob mentioned, we have a strong balance sheet and remain focused on augmenting our internal innovation with external growth opportunities. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities of all sizes that are aligned with our strategy we explained in December and will further build this great company. In a highly dynamic macro environment, Agilent is excelling. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year 2025 commitments and in our long term trajectory towards financial framework we explained at Investor Day. With Ignite scaling and our pace of innovation accelerating, Agilent is well positioned to outperform regardless of the near term market dynamics. After one year as CEO, I'm even more energized by what we're accomplishing at Agilent, and we're only getting started. Thank you for your attention. I'll now hand it over to Parmeet to kick off our Q and A.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Maybe one just on the order trends that you guys saw in the quarter. Can you just give us some color how those progressed as the quarter progressed? I mean, you guys are unique with the timing, probably saw a little bit of the pharma tariffs, the actual tariffs come in. Just curious, if you're willing to talk about April, certainly, May would be welcomed as well. But what you saw on the order front? Did you see any pull forward around the pharma tariffs? I know you talked about the ACG pull forward on the consumables. But just curious what you're hearing from customers? And again, what you thought on the order front versus the revenue side would be helpful as well.\nPadraig McDonnell: So first of all, book to bill was greater than 1 and our orders grew low single digits in Q2. And overall for the first half orders grew mid-single digits. So in terms of any pull forward from Pharma, we haven't seen anything. We've seen actually very stable business across the regions of course as Bob talked about in the script. We did see a pull forward in consumables that comes out in the wash given some of the issues we had with customs etc. in April, but that's back to normal now. So what I would say is peak pharma customers are in particular still spending on key projects. The replacement cycle continues and so no changes there. And we do expect this gradual recovery to continue in the second half.\nPatrick Donnelly: And then maybe just on the NASD BIOVECTRA piece, it sounds like those performed quite well in the quarter. Can you talk about expectations for the rest of your, it sounds like NASD is maybe creeping a little bit higher, which is great. Can you talk about the visibility there? I know sometimes you get orders well out a few quarters. I mean, are you into ‘26 on some of these order books? Maybe just talk about the visibility and what you're seeing in those businesses would be helpful.\nPadraig McDonnell: I'll start and I'll hand it over to Simon. So first of all, really, really pleased by the progress in our CDMO business and NASD with high single digit growth and with BIOVECTRA in the high teens. We're seeing the combination of these businesses right in the sweet spot of really important therapeutic areas coming together. But I'll hand it over to Simon for more color on that.\nSimon May: I'd say overall in the CDMO businesses we were pleased on a couple of major fronts for the quarter just past. We saw progression of some early commercial programs in the NASD business. We've talked about that a few times previously. We're now starting to see the revenue mix there evolve more from 50/50 towards 60/40 in favor of commercial. We think that bodes well for the future. And then in the BIOVECTRA business, there was also some really noticeable progress. Our GLP-1 manufacturing programs, we saw successful scale up there. We saw some nice process efficiency gains. And that's now beginning to become a pretty meaningful contributor to the CDMO business overall. As we think about going forward in the near term, I'd say we're pretty confident about the second half of the year as we look at NASD. In particular, we've got very clear line of sight to the double digit growth that was mentioned in the script. I'd say we've got the orders in house that we need to fulfill that. And then longer term, we continue to think we're extremely well positioned in this space. And again, these combined capabilities of NASD and BIOVECTRA really put us in the sweet spot of advanced therapeutic modalities and particular areas that really excites us like oligos and antibody drug conjugates. And bioconjugation generally is a really high growth area where we've got real strong capability in BIOVECTRA. So a lot to be pleased about in the quarter. As always, I'd caveat it. This business is lumpy. It will continue to be lumpy, but we're on a clear upward trajectory here. We feel like we're nicely positioned and we got a good line of sight to the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to follow-up on Patrick's first question just around the in quarter impact you saw on ordering just around the tariffs. The $15 million of consumables that got pulled forward, what were you hearing from customers as to just the reason for why that happened? Just curious about that. And then on the instrument side, does the guide assume you recapture that in the fiscal third quarter? Or do you think that could come later in the year?\nRobert W. McMahon: Jack, this is Bob. I'll take that. And as you can imagine, in China, given the high tariff rates that were being proposed at the time of mid-April, there was a desire to try to get ahead of that from some of our customers and we had inventory in-country. And so we just saw some stocking of orders that would normally be throughout Q3 being pulled into Q2 and being delivered. On the flip side, because of the changing tariffs, there were a number of longer delivery times and logistics activities that were happening at the ports in China as well that primarily impacted our instrument business because we bring those in. And so that offset in total in China. And so when we look at that, we would expect no change. We didn't see any change to our overall revenue in Q2, just some moves between instruments and consumables. And that will reverse itself we expect here in Q3. But again, in total for Q2 and Q3 the total results, are fine.\nJack Meehan: Got it. That makes sense. And I think that explains where I was going to go with my second question as to why China was much better than I was thinking. So I do have one other follow-up, which is, Bob, just can you boil it all down now on the margin side for the year, kind of what the guide implies for operating margin?\nRobert W. McMahon: So the margin, given obviously the cost associated with the incremental tariffs, we are covering that with a combination of tariff mitigation activities as well as some pricing surcharges and then some of the Ignite. But given the impact of that, it will be closer to flat versus year ago. If you took that out, we would still be on track for the margin expansion similar to what we saw here in Q2 as an example. So we were flat year on year. But if you took out that 55 basis points, we've been right on track. So we still feel good about that cadence going forward, particularly when we talk about 2026. When we talk about mitigations, that means that we will eliminate the gross impact of the tariffs through some of the supply chain moves that are already ongoing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: In the past you've noted that the majority of your exposure within your pharma business is in clinical versus earlier stage research. Have you seen any differences between the ordering patterns of these two applications, especially with the recent uncertainty in the research spend from these customers?\nPadraig McDonnell: No, I would say the lion's share of our business is actually on the QAQC and development side and we saw small molecule actually grow 10% in the quarter which was a fantastic result. So we see across pharma that actually that's the part that's more resilient currently and particularly in the future where you see potential reshoring that may happen over a few years of course. QAQC testing benefits from that and of course benefits by the way from supply chain changes with pharma around the globe as they look to mitigate things themselves. So overall, I would say a very strong quarter on that side and we continue to expect. We do actually of course serve our customers on the R&D side and the development side, but the vast majority would be on the QAQC side.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then within PFAS, we've seen some potential easing of regulation within water in the US. Have you seen this impact orders as customers work through the uncertainty? And then how much can growth in food and product testing offset potential weakness in the water regulation?\nPadraig McDonnell: So first of all, just a tremendous result in PFAS in Q2. We grew 75% year-over-year and also saw tremendous growth around consumables and connect rates with our systems. Just to give a little bit of color as well, Europe and China led really grew well and of course with EMEA. So lots to like about us. If you think about some of the recent announcements, it's hard to get some of the details in those announcements with the restructuring that's going on. But I think you're going to see the water testing continue over the next few quarters especially in the broader area outside the US. I think the larger part of our PFAS business in the US over the next year or the next half is going to come from industrial based testing that's around wastewater silent discharges. That's where you see people worried about litigation. You'll see a lot from the EPA coming out to pay for any infringements. So we also see that material testing globally and water testing in EMEA, APAC to drive business over the next two quarters. So I would say we're expecting very strong results for the year, but beyond the year extremely strong as well. There's also one emerging thing that's coming up quite a bit is that PFAS testing is going to start more into air and volatile PFAS, which is right in our sweet spot for GCMS. Currently, that's about, I would say, 2% to 3% of the market. But over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect that to go to 8% to 12% of the market where we will have a very high market share win rate on that. So that gives the color on PFAS.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: I want to follow-up on your comments there and Evie's question regarding reshoring. You've had a few of your peers call this out as a potential tailwind, just given the number of capacity announcements that we've heard from pharma companies in recent months. Can you walk us through, have you had any concrete conversations with customers regarding these capacity build outs? And how do we think about the timing of when we could see any tailwinds related to onshoring?\nPadraig McDonnell: Having spent three decades in this industry and actually the earlier parts of those decades in Ireland when there was a lot of pharmaceutical being built in Ireland in terms of capacity. Generally, the way these things happen, it takes quite a bit of time. What we're leading with is our strategic account program. So we're at the very highest levels with our pharma customers. Discussions are extremely early. So I wouldn't say any concrete out of that yet. But generally what happens is you see the plans for the site being put up. You also see qualification plans for the site. Generally construction tenders are out. And then from the construction tenders people think about lab capacity and that is the point which is really critical to be in and we feel very good about our position with the strategic accounts. Also by the way you hear of methods moving early so maybe it moves from EMEA to the US. So we find out from our large installed bases where those methods are going to go. But we don't expect anything. I would say you're going to see something maybe at the end of two to three years. But it will be a tailwind for us given the amount of systems and also the proportion of QAQC in those systems.\nRachel Vatnsdal: And then just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on pricing. Can you talk about your ability to pass on price in this environment given the dynamic environment that we're seeing in light of tariffs? And in general, what's embedded for pricing for the rest of the year and for guidance?\nPadraig McDonnell: I'll take the first part and I'll give the second part to Bob on it. So we have enterprise pricing capability that we build through Ignite. So we do surcharges in a very structured way. Clearly we're looking at our competitive situation around in different regions and making sure we're staying focused on the customers. So based on the work we're already optimizing our pricing and we have- it has been quite a big part of our mitigation going forward. But Bob, don't know if you want talk about guide?\nRobert W. McMahon: To build on what Padraig said, just to reiterate what we said in the prepared remarks, we've already achieved what we achieved all of last year through the first six months of this. So a very good performance there. If you recall, in our guide, we had about 100 basis points of price. We're on track for that for the year, probably a little bit higher with the pricing mitigation activities that are being established as a result of tariffs. As you can imagine, depending on the competitive nature there, the type of pricing that we would have vis-a-vis the supply chain activities, which would be a permanent mitigation, we're balancing all of those as well as the Ignite savings activities as well. So we are not taking all of the mitigation from tariffs out of price. We think that is something that will help us with our customers as well. And looking to move things around to have what we would call internally kind of no regrets moves to be able to manage our supply chain globally, given the dynamic nature of how these rates are moving back and forth. So that's kind of how we're thinking about the second half of the year. And again, in 2026, we would expect to have all of the tariff rates being mitigated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: First one on the replacement cycle, you talked about book to bill being more than 1. Just trying to understand how should we think about the Infinity III replacement cycle? How is it doing in the environmental labs versus the pharma labs? What are you seeing in the field? Early traction? Maybe just help us understand how should we think about the anatomy of this replacement cycle for Agilent?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I'd be happy go through some details. So the Infinity III ramp continues extremely well. We see a lot of very strong adoption and customer feedback continues to be very positive. Our order funnel is really growing nicely with the Infinity III and we're really pleased with market acceptance. What we're actually seeing with Infinity III on the replacement cycle is we're seeing actually a higher connect rate in service and consumers with that system, which really bodes well for the future. But overall replacement cycles on the LC side, I'll focus on that first and then maybe talk to the broader portfolio. We've been seeing a continuous ramp on that. We expect that to continue over the next few quarters. We have thousands of 1100s. We have 1260s, 1290s. We're moving through that replacement cycle. But of course, it doesn't happen in one quarter. It doesn't happen sequentially quarter after quarter. You see it gradually build. And generally, I would say the funnel to close is about six to nine months to close an LC order. So we continue to see that increase, but very pleased with the adoption. And of course, there's a much broader continuum around our replacement cycle given our GC, GCMS and our LCMS installed bases that are already I think continuing to start to replace.\nRobert W. McMahon: Hey, Padraig, just to reiterate some of the proof points that you talked about when we talk about small molecule QAQC, which is the lion's share of installed base that grew double digits in Q2 from a revenue, all in inclusive of service consumables and instrumentation. So it speaks to the full workflow solution. And to your question about environmental, that's our sweet spot and we grew in PFAS over 70%. So I think it can kind of tells how well that's being adopted in the environmental space as well.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. And my follow-up is, can you size how much of the China growth in the quarter was from the sort of the Lunar New Year timing perspective, how Lunar New Year played out this year versus last year versus the sort of the consumable pull forward that you saw? And what was the China stimulus in the quarter?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah, I'll start on that Puneet. So the pull forward of the consumables that we were talking about actually had nothing to do with Lunar New Year. It was really driven by the tariffs. So that I think is an idiosyncratic activity that wouldn't continue. The Lunar New Year played out the way we expected it to for the full year guide. So there's roughly about 2 points of total company when you look at the change year on year and it kind of played out the way we expected it to. And so if you look at our revenue dollars in China sequentially, it's actually a very good performance, still well above $300 million speaks to the stability in that market. And in terms of the last question that you had around stimulus, we continue to be pleased about the performance. If you looked at the applied markets, we had some very good performance in food, some of the other implied markets. Most of our stimulus was actually in Q1, but we're very optimistic about the funnel activity right now for the next stimulus, which we are starting to work with our customers and putting together bids for the second half of this year, probably will be revenue at the end of our calendar year here potentially in Q4 that would be upside. If it is in Q4, we haven't built that into our numbers. But feel very optimistic about our ability to do that given our made in China capabilities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: My first one on the guidance here. You look at ACG, think ex the pull forward, it was still a pretty healthy six plus, maybe high singles kind of number. Why is it slowing down to low singles? I think you said in 3Q. And when you apply that to overall company, right, I think it's stepping down by 250 basis points sequentially. I know like on a year on year basis like the comps maybe explains that. But on a stack comp basis, it looks maybe a little conservative. So maybe talk about the third quarter assumptions.\nAngelica Riemann: Thanks for the question. I think coming back to the tariff related consumables pull forward, right, we made those adjustments. And so once we make those adjustments for the quarter on quarter growth rates and normalize them, the guide is in the mid-single digit range. So that's really accounting for it. But when you look more holistically, the fundamentals of ACG remain incredibly strong as we look towards the rest of the year. We're well positioned to continue to support customers as they're maximizing the assets in their laboratory through the broad portfolio, whether that's consumables, services as well as some of the other offerings in the ECG portfolio. So we just adjusted and still a healthy growth rate across ECG for full year.\nVijay Kumar: Then maybe one on the P&L. I think on the margins, I thought I heard you say gross margins was in line. It looks like versus Street, maybe numbers came down. Sequentially, gross margins were down. Maybe talk about what happened on gross margins, was that a mix impact? And I think you had a restructuring charge, which wasn't there in prior quarters. Is this some new cost actions that hasn't been initiated?\nRobert W. McMahon: When we were talking about the gross margins, if you look at it year on year, we did have the unplanned tariff activity, which was about 55 basis points in gross margin that hit in Q2. If you look at it versus year ago, there was a combination of tariffs, product mix, which we had incorporated as well as some currency related activities. So feel good about kind of where that is. In terms of restructuring, that's probably more on a GAAP basis, Vijay. And we would have taken that out for the numbers that I was just referencing on a non-GAAP basis. But that would have been part of some of the organizational health activities that Padraig had mentioned as part of Ignite.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: I want to go back to NASD. The comps get easier here in the back half. So presumably double digit growth. Could that business be double digit for the full year? Or should we think about high single digit for NASD? Also, can you talk about capacity utilization as we think about Trane C and D and then also BIOVECTRA full finish? And then third question on that is just with the onshoring theme, are you seeing more interest from pharma given that most of that business is US and then some in Canada? Has that kind of peaked and then picked up interest from some pharma companies?\nSimon May: So as we think about the back end of the year and NASD and we've been saying all along that we envision high single digit growth and nudging double digit growth. I'd say there's a growing confidence that we think we can nudge that double digit growth as we look at the forecast that we're seeing begin to crystallize for Q3 and Q4. And then as far as BIOVECTRA goes, I think we're going to see a sequential dip in the third quarter. We're looking at some planned equipment shutdowns there. And as those come online again, which we anticipate in Q4, provided that all goes to plan, then I think we'll be back to firing on all cylinders where that's concerned. As for Train C and Train D, we've been through this dynamic for a while now where we were coming through the back end of the IRA impacts and then we started to see our order intake really improve in 2024. That's continued through to 2025. Again, I think we've got pretty much all of the orders in hand now to deliver on 2025. So that utilization of Train C, Train D is starting to become another positive tailwind driver for us now.\nPadraig McDonnell: And I would say we haven't seen any impact at all from potential tariffs on pharma etc. reshoring or shifts at all in that business in any conversations we have with our pharma.\nTycho Peterson: And then follow-up on replacement cycle. I appreciate the commentary and color you gave previously. Are you able to give us what percentage of LC systems are Infinity III at this point? Is it 15%, 20% of the mix? And then you haven't talked much about the GC replacement cycle. You did kind of allude to that. How are you thinking about that as well?\nPadraig McDonnell: It's steadily growing. I mean we're six months into the launch or a little bit more than that on the Infinity III. So it's building over time, but we don't give out the exact percentage of our installed base on that one. But I can assure you it's going extremely well, Tycho. And given what we're seeing on the cadence from our older systems and even up to the 1260s and 1290s customers are really voting for the Infinity III when they replace. But I'm going to ask Mike Zhang here on the GC replacement cycle.\nMike Zhang: We're the leader in the GC and also GCMS and we have a very large installed base and we're working with our customers. And I can tell you, yes, we have a large installed base. We have some very significant AGS installed base as well. We're actually very excited to see some very strong momentum with our customers, well, the GC and also GCMS. If you look at our order pace, think it's very encouraging. And we also have been exciting new innovations. We just launched the new GC and we have other exciting innovations as well. What I can tell is in the next few quarters, next few years, we're going to see a significant opportunity coming to materialize.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Couillard: Bob, you took down the operating cash flow guide for the year. Is that driven by tariffs and maybe inventory builds? And could you quantify the impact of currency on EPS in 2Q and then what's embedded for the full year now?\nRobert W. McMahon: You are spot on, and from a cash flow perspective, that is, in fact, what we have done is looked at building inventory, which is impacting our cash flow. It's kind of a onetime activity as well as some capital equipment as well as building up. We didn't change our overall capital forecast, but there is some working capital there as well. So that's what we have. In terms of the EPS, it's close to about a point or two from an EPS standpoint for the full year impact, Brandon. And we can get you the details post call.\nBrandon Couillard: Big picture, the balance sheet is very clean right now. Are you less likely to consider a larger deal right now given the macro, tariffs, interest rate volatility? Or are you seeing more attractive valuations for assets? And how do you think about those trade-offs?\nPadraig McDonnell: We don't make any decisions based on the news that we see every week around how we're going to deploy capital going forward. But I can say a few things. We have a very strong list of opportunities. It's wedded in our strategy. So we have done a lot of work on that. Of course valuations are down a little bit, but of course we're going to remain very disciplined in what we do going forward. But I will say that M&A will become a bigger part of our story over the next few years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: I'll focus both on the margins and sort of the cadence through the year. Bob, you talked a lot about the impact of tariffs on 2Q, the 55 bps. But just looking at the gross margin guide, not the guide, but the implied number is kind of flat for throughout the rest of the year, maybe down 100 bps year-over-year. So the implied OpEx step up in 3Q and 4Q especially, it seems like it's coming off from the SG&A side. Could you just talk through how much of that is- whether that's volume leverage or the Ignite transformation coming through?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. It's a little of both. As you could probably imagine, if you look at our kind of normal seasonality kind of first half to second half, we do have a step up in margin. Some of that's related to volume. We also have more holidays and lower spending in the second half of the year. And then you've got the full impact of Ignite transformation that Padraig talked about. We talked about this $80 million of annualized, $40 million of that will happen here in the second half of the year, which will help us offset some of the tariffs. So you're right, more of our margin improvement in the second half was actually going to show up in the OpEx because tariffs show up in the gross margin. And so we've got some mitigation at the gross margin side, but also the mitigation activities in the OpEx side as well.\nMichael Ryskin: And then on the tariff side, your point on, like you just said, partially offsetting as you go through the year on gross side, but then fully offsetting in 2026. So how do we think about gross margins either as a percent or whatever for 2026? Like what's the right jumping off point? Because optically, you're going to have a really easy compare of 54.5%, 55% for the year, but a lot of that is artificially depressed. So are we going to expect like a nice gross margin jump in '26 because those offsets and that mitigation kicks in for next year?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. I would say, if I could forecast what tariffs are going to be here by '26, that would be something. But that being said, if they stayed the way they are, I would expect us to be able to have an improved gross margin next year for a couple of reasons. One is exactly what you just talked about. The gross will be eliminated. It's not just a mitigation, will eliminate it through the resourcing or reshoring of our supply chain. You'll have the benefit of volume as well. And then we also talked about the pricing capabilities that we would expect to have more price next year through price realization than we had here as a result of some of the pricing capabilities that Padraig talked about. So still early days, so we're not giving guidance here for 2026, but certainly, there's some opportunities more from a tailwind perspective in gross margin going into 2026.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDan Leonard: I was hoping you could perhaps elaborate on trends you're seeing in China by end markets. I think you mentioned industrials was down low single digits, but just elsewhere between pharma, environmental, etc.?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So I think in China, we've seen a pretty very stable business. I mean, except for that pull forward on us, I would say that you see that industrials are down a little bit, but pharma is pretty stable. And I would say that there's a lot of excitement I would say building in China around the second phase of the stimulus, which is going to be more broader based. It's actually going to be more much more broader based than it was the last time the funnels are looking extremely strong for that. But I would say overall it's stable.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes, I would agree. If you look across, pharma, academia, government, food and environmental forensics were up. Diagnostics clinical to our smallest market was flat and then CAM was down just slightly. And some of that had to do with some of the instrumentation delays through customs that happened. Now you may ask why in China, because actually even though it was made in China, that has to go through a bonded warehouse and that still has to go through customs and it actually takes a little longer time. So no custom no tariff impact from that standpoint, but it still required going through customs. And so we expect that to come back here in Q3.\nDan Leonard: And then Bob, a follow-up on Q3 guidance overall. It looks like the midpoint of organic revenue growth is about 2% and that is a sequential step down from the 5% you just reported. I know there's some China timing issue there, but can you walk me through the main bridge factors between the Q2 result and the lower Q3 guide?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. So a couple of things. We think we're taking a prudent approach given some of the still uncertainty in the tariff announcements here. Feel very good about our momentum going into Q3. And we also have a little more difficult comp in Q3 than we have Q2. So I wouldn't read too much into it when I look at sequential numbers in Q3 versus Q2.\nOperator: And Mr. Ahuja, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Regina. And thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. With that, we'd like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2025 Agilent Technologies Inc. Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Parmeet Ahuja, you may begin the conference.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, Regina, and welcome everyone to Agilent’s conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Simon May, President of the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group; Angelica Riemann, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group; and Mike Zhang, President of the Applied Markets Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The press release for our first quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today’s discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are available on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today’s comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You’ll find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we implemented certain changes to our reporting structure related to reorganization of our three business segments. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes and have provided the financial details on our website. These changes have no impact on our company’s consolidated financial statements. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company’s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risk and other factors. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Thank you, Parmeet, and thanks to all of you for joining today’s call. As you saw in our press release, we had a very solid start to the year, exceeding our expectations for core revenue growth and EPS. Before diving into the details, I want to first follow-up on conversations I had with many of you starting at our Analyst and Investor Day in December at the New York Stock Exchange and provide an update on progress of our Ignite Transformation. We’ve stated that Ignite is for our customers, employees, and shareholders. For customers, we want to create a seamless experience across Agilent products, software, and services. For our employees, we want to become nimbler and reduce complexity to enhance our ability to serve our customers. And for shareholders, we want to deliver industry-leading shareholder value through differentiated growth. We have set targets to grow core revenues between 5% and 7% annually, expand our operating margin by 50 to 100 plus basis points per year, and deliver double-digit EPS growth. Right now, I want to share three notable accomplishments from the Ignite Transformation that focus on setting a new pricing mechanisms, elevating our digital ecosystem, and identifying procurement opportunities. First, the creation of an Enterprise strategic-pricing organization that will focus on setting our standard approach for pricing across the entire solution set with the customer and not just at a tactical bottoms-up product level. Second, our digital ecosystem, a critical enabler in our evolved strategy we unveiled at Investor Day continues to be a key area of investment for us. Already, we have made meaningful improvements to our website, upgrading the user experience on our e-commerce platform by making it easier to find and purchase the products our customers need, helping driving topline growth. In Q1, our progress continued with digital orders growing high-single-digits. And third, our procurement teams have challenged our historical approach and are identifying significant cost-savings opportunities in many of Agilent’s functions. Also related to our Ignite Transformation, we’re assessing our organizational health. On my first day as CEO, I promised our employees we would become a nimbler organization to make decisions faster and accelerate innovation in service of our customers. As a result, we are removing some management layers and increasing spans of control. This is a continuation of our new organizational structure we announced in late November. Through that reorganization, we’re seeing our business leaders in lockstep on our strategy and transformation. This alignment enables us to make business decisions faster on priorities and trade-offs. As my leadership team and I look forward, we are focused on growing Agilent. A foundational element of growth is innovation, innovation that our customers want. Every time I visit a customer in any part of the world, they say the same thing; they want to partner with Agilent for better outcomes. That’s what differentiates Agilent, the deep scientific knowledge of our customer-facing team members that our competitors simply can’t duplicate. Customers want everything from the ability to parse massive amounts of data in seconds, to automating more tasks so they can focus on complex scientific challenges. In essence, they want to increase their productivity. That’s why driving lab productivity is among our key priorities. You can see evidence of this in our collaborative agreement with Zurich-based ABB Robotics to produce automated laboratory solutions, ones that will help our customers find new ways of improved workflows and make operations more efficient and flexible. These are customers across multiple markets, including pharma, biotech, energy, and food. Together with ABB, Agilent can transform the customer lab operations by making workflow processes for research, development, and quality control faster and more efficient. The goal is for all instruments, robots, and software to be interoperable, which is crucial to significantly boosting productivity for our customers. Our customers want to buy whole product solutions not just a single instrument. To illustrate that, our Infinity III series that we introduced in October has seen great adoption from all our customers. As a reminder, the Infinity III has an advanced automation that simplifies our customers’ daily routines and is compatible with previous generations, which allows for seamless upgrades and technology refreshes. And that has become a differentiator. Customers are saying that the backward compatibility combined with the modularity of Agilent systems allows them to decide how to upgrade and refresh their instruments. Plus, they’re telling us that they’re choosing Agilent because of our longstanding quality and technology leadership that’s been further enforced with the Infinity III. And the Agilent InfinityLab LC Solutions are certified by My Green Lab. These instruments optimize lab space, and they reduce water, solvent, and energy consumption while also minimizing waste. We continue to see strong momentum and growth in our sales funnel for the Infinity III because of its advanced automation that empowers our customers to be more productive and because of InfinityLab Assist, our automation software that provides on-board intelligence. So, our customers are not simply buying a platform, but a whole product solution. Just as exciting is that the great success of our Infinity III provides Agilent an incredible opportunity for us to upgrade our customers’ instruments. And it’s already happening across our legacy LC platforms, representing an opportunity in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming years. Now, I’d like to highlight some key aspects of our Q1 results. As you can see from our press release, we drove topline year-over-year growth while macro market trends, such as CapEx spending, continue to improve. Our revenue of $1.681 billion increased 1% over the same quarter in FY ‘24. This result exceeded our expectations and was led by excellent growth in PFAS and capturing an outsized share of the China stimulus awards. Our instrument book-to-bill was greater than one in Q1, a quarter when it’s typically less than one. This is another sign of market recovery, but more importantly, it’s a testament to our intense customer focus with products such as the highly successful Infinity III and our success driving our market-leading position in China. Additionally, we exceeded expectations in all regions and end markets except for Academia and Government. In our end markets, revenue was led by Food, which grew 9% driven by our success in capturing stimulus orders in China. In China, our accelerating share gains were apparent in recording a win rate of more than 50% on stimulus-related tenders. With our long history in the region elevated by our local manufacturing capabilities, we are well-positioned to expand our market leadership in China. Now, let me talk about our businesses and some growth vectors in each. Our Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group grew 1% in the quarter, reporting $647 million. Performance was driven by a nice result in our LC and LCMS instruments, which grew high-single-digits during the quarter on the heels of our Infinity III launch. Within LDG, we remain focused on the integration of BIOVECTRA and we are delighted by the response we’re hearing from our existing and potential customers who are interested in leveraging BIOVECTRA’s unique capabilities and Agilent’s expertise. It’s clear that BIOVECTRA’s capabilities are in the sweet spot of tremendous markets with a terrific growth potential. The Agilent CrossLab Group grew 3%, reporting $696 million, which was in-line with our expectations, led by services. We are especially excited about the new ACG that now includes services, automation, consumables, and software and informatics. Software and informatics are among our key priorities, and we’ve had an overwhelmingly positive response to both our InfinityLab Assist automation software and our OpenLab CDS. The InfinityLab automation software offers remote notifications, trouble shootings, diagnostics, and maintenance that paves the way for a fully-automated, digital lab. And our OpenLab CDS provides time-saving steps in analysis, interpretation, and reporting workflows while technical controls ensure work quality, effective records management, and enhanced data security. In short, software is an incredible area of opportunity for us that we are poised to capitalize upon. Already, customers are telling us that InfinityLab Assist and OpenLab offer differentiated functionality and solutions in high-throughput environments. Our Applied Markets Group reported $338 million in the quarter, a 2% decline better than expected related to a strong China stimulus orders. We are very pleased with our team’s ability to compete and win these tenders. We continue to invest in the Applied Markets for next-generation technology innovation and, as I said, support our customers with lab productivity. Every customer we meet has expressed a desire to partner with Agilent to make better use of their instrument fleets to integrate with front-end solutions. And, we’re happy to help them find ways to create customized solutions so they can deliver products faster. Before I hand over to Bob, I want to address topics that have been in the news of late. Regarding the recent news around tariffs, we have a diversified supply chain with a manufacturing presence in all major regions of the world. Our teams already are taking action to mitigate the impacts on our business. In terms of potential reductions to NIH funding, as we’ve shared with you before, our exposure to NIH-related programs is limited to around 1% of our revenue. We currently believe the forecasted impact is manageable within our current guidance. Bob, will now delve deeper on our Q1 results, as well as our outlook for Q2. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Bob?\nRobert W. McMahon: Thanks Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I’ll then cover our updated full-year and second quarter guidance. As Padraig mentioned, Q1 revenue was $1.68 billion, just above the top-end of guidance despite the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter. On a core basis, we posted growth of 1.2%, beating expectations. Adjusting for the timing of Lunar New Year impacts, core growth is estimated to be just over 3%. On a reported basis, growth was 1.4%. Currency had a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points, which was over one percentage point higher than estimated at the start of the quarter. And M&A contributed 1.6%. Padraig already discussed our business group results, so I’ll focus on deeper details about our end markets. We exceeded expectations in all of our end markets except for our smallest one, Academia and Government. Our business in the Food market grew 9%, benefiting from our excellent performance in China’s national stimulus program. In Environmental and Forensics, we grew 6% as we continue to leverage our best-in-class PFAS workflow solutions to grow our market-leading position. We continue to capitalize on the strong demand for PFAS testing that we are seeing globally. Our 6495 triple quad LCMS is the most complete instrument in the PFAS testing market with a specific performance edge in small and fragile molecules where many of the emerging PFAS exist. Along with our new offerings in PFAS-specific consumables and our workflow deployment services, Agilent provides the fastest, highest-quality and most reliable way for customers to add or expand PFAS testing capabilities in their labs. Now looking across all end markets, PFAS grew 70% in the quarter, contributing 75 basis points of growth to the company. Pharma was flat during the quarter, with low-single-digit growth ex-China offset by a high-single-digit decline in China. Globally biopharma and small molecule performed roughly in-line with the overall market. In Chemical and Advanced Materials, revenue declined 2% with growth ex-China offset by a high-teens decline in China, which was mostly impacted by the timing of the Lunar New Year. Our business in the Diagnostics and Clinical end market grew 7%, led by strong results in the Americas and Europe. Academia and Government, our smallest market, saw a decline of 7%, with soft results around the globe. Now moving on to our regional performance, the Americas grew 3%, Europe grew 2%, and Asia ex-China grew 2%, all slightly ahead of expectations. China revenue declined 4%, also better than expectations, on the strength of our stimulus performance. For your models, we estimate that Lunar New Year was a $10 million revenue headwind in the quarter, which we expect to come back in the second quarter. This compares to a $25 million favorable Lunar New Year impact in the first quarter of last year, so combined a 2 percentage point year-on-year impact. Now, let’s move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 54.7% in the quarter, down versus last year primarily due to mix, currency and the Lunar New Year timing. We drove operating margins of 25.1%, roughly in-line with our expectations, despite currency headwinds. While down versus last year, we expect improvement throughout the year as the results of our Ignite Transformation continue to deliver. And below the line, our net interest expense was better than expected as was our tax rate of 12.5%. And we had $287 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q1 earnings per share were $1.31. That was ahead of our expectations and up 2% from a year ago, growing slightly faster than revenue. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $431 million in the quarter, and we invested $97 million in capital expenditures. We purchased $90 million in shares and paid out $71 million through dividends during the quarter. And, we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.0. In summary, we had a good start to the year, and expect continued steady improvement in the market through the year. Now, let’s move on to our outlook for the fiscal year and the second quarter. While we exceeded core growth expectations for Q1, we are maintaining our core growth guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% for the year. This guidance incorporates an element of prudence reflecting the uncertainty over the U.S. federal funding environment, even though it is a small part of our business. However, we are adjusting our full-year reported revenue to be in the range of $6.68 billion to $6.76 billion to reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. If you recall our initial guidance back in November incorporated only a very modest FX headwind. Since then, the U.S. dollar has appreciated and based on current exchange rates, we are now projecting an incremental $110 million in currency headwinds relative to our prior guidance. Currency is now expected to represent a 1.9% headwind for the year versus a prior 20 basis point headwind. We also have left our M&A guidance unchanged at plus 2.0% to 2.2% revenue impact for the year. Full-year, non-GAAP earnings per share are unchanged at $5.54 to $5.61, representing an increase of 4.7% to 6.0%. Relative to our prior guide, currency net of hedging is an estimated additional $0.09 headwind for the year, which we are covering. This assumes flat other income and expense, a 12.5% tax rate, and $286 million diluted shares outstanding. Now for the second quarter, we are guiding to revenue of $1.61 billion to $1.65 billion. This range is a bit wider than we typically use for the upcoming quarter, reflecting the uncertainty around U.S. Federal Government spending. This range represents an increase of 2.5% to 5% growth on a core basis and an increase of 2.4% to 4.9% growth on a reported basis. Currency is a 2.1% headwind, and M&A impact is expected to be a 2% benefit for the quarter. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28, representing growth of 2.5% to 4.9%. Year-on-year currency net of hedging is expected to be a $0.02 headwind to EPS. Now, I would like to turn the call over back to Padraig for closing comments. Padraig?\nPadraig McDonnell: Thanks, Bob. Before we end the call, I want to take this opportunity to highlight more of the Agilent team’s tremendous work. This quarter, the World Economic Forum named our factories in Shanghai, China and Penang, Malaysia, as Global Lighthouse Networks. This recognizes Agilent for its breakthroughs in scaling AI, 3D printing, robotics, big-data analytics, and industrial internet of things. I was delighted to be able to accept those awards in person this year at the Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Shanghai and Penang are two of four Agilent manufacturing sites that have earned this prestigious distinction. In 2022, the Forum named our Singapore and Waldbronn, Germany, sites as Lighthouses. Still today, Agilent is the only analytical and clinical laboratory technology company in the world to be recognized by the World Economic Forum. Also during the quarter, Newsweek ranked Agilent No. 10 out of 600 on its 2025 list of America’s Most Responsible Companies up seven places from 2024. This is our sixth consecutive year on the prestigious list and is a recognition of Agilent being a leading sustainable lab partner to our customers. We are proud to be among the U.S. based companies who are making a positive global impact. At Agilent, we’re only at the start of our Ignite Transformation journey and already we’re seeing early benefits like the ones I described at the start of this call. In less than nine months, we’ve made incredible changes that are improving our customers’ productivity in an era when the pace of science is faster than ever. We’re also becoming nimbler for our employees to better serve our customers. The outcome we’re enabling is faster decision making so that we can accelerate innovation and create differentiated growth. And that, in turn, leads to industry-leading shareholder value. What we are doing at Agilent is turning a good company into a great one. We are committed to continuous improvement and adapting to changing market dynamics. Thank you for joining today’s call. Let’s move to Q&A. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Good afternoon, and thanks so much for taking the questions. So first up, I just kind of wanted to dig into some of this prudence that you mentioned in the guide. Obviously, you’re talking up some of the progress that you guys have seen on your orderbook, but you’re also acknowledging some of that headline risk that we’ve seen on the funding side the last month and a half or so. So, could you quantify for us what level of headline risk can be really embedded into not only the fiscal 2Q guide, but the full-year guide at this point? And then have you seen any impact so far from customers and what are you really seeing from your sales teams that are boots on the ground?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, thanks for the question, Rachel. You know, our guide is a prudent one as we see a lot of changes happening. I will say from our customer base and particularly in our pharma base, activity has increased. The sentiment is increasing as we talk to our customers. Of course, things are, on the macro side are changing with NIH funding, which were less than 1% and, of course, tariffs, which we can mitigate. So, I would say our guide is as a prudent one, but we’ll be able to monitor that as we go through the next quarters. But Bob, I don’t know if you want to add more detail.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Rachel, good afternoon. And to your point, around the prudence, we did raise, increase the range for our second quarter guide to roughly $40 million in between the low and the high. It’s typically anywhere from $25 million to $30 million. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our NIH funding is roughly 1% at the maximum. And so, given the strength that we had in the first quarter and the fact that we’re not raising guide, we feel that we’re well compensating any potential downside. And to Padraig’s point, we haven’t seen any of that materially impact our business, and the activity in our customers.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. And then just on my follow-up, I hate to ask specifically on FX, but I think it’s a question that a lot of us have on the line here. Can you just walk us through how much of the EPS number in the fiscal 2Q number especially is impacted by that FX given how much rates have really moved within the quarter? And then same idea just on the margin front, especially around that 2Q and for the full-year at all, what would that look like without these FX impacts? Thanks.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes, that’s a great question, Rachel. So, let me give you a little more data. So for the full-year, that incremental $110 million is a $0.09 impact for the full-year, as I mentioned before, and that really is roughly a 50 basis point headwind to the overall company that we’re covering. If I look at it for second quarter, it’s about a $30 million, $32 million headwind in the quarter, roughly 2.1% and it’s $0.02 to $0.03 in the quarter, and roughly the same kind of impact from a profitability standpoint.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Ebie on for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one, can you talk through the opportunities within PFAS given the 70% growth you saw in the quarter? How much of this demand is coming from Europe following the packaging regulation? And then also, what do you think the growth contribution going forward could look like for this market?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks for the question. So, the demand for PFAS solutions remains extremely strong. During Q1, the solutions growth accounted for 75 basis points at a company level. And while most of the volume came on the environmental side, we’re seeing actually exceptional growth in food and chemical materials as well. And the opportunity in Q1 grew 70%, but also if you look at that compared to Q4 was 50%, it was a big step up in growth rates. And, with the environmental market still accounts for the largest part of the PFAS revenues. We saw increased customer purchasing in the CAM market, with water discharge in some of those areas. And really we see, all regions doing well. We saw a little bit of a pause in China, which had a great sequential quarter of growth in PFAS. But that’s normal as labs tool up on the equipment side. Europe was very strong and we expect that to be very strong. And, this is a market and this is an area where it’s going to continue to morph and grow depending on new regulations and expanding into new modalities. And I will say, at the core of this is our 6595D triple quad, which is the leading sensitivity in the market, which helps with emerging PFAS characterization and of course our ability to offer consumables and workflow deployment services are really important as customers get set up quickly in their labs.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. And Ebie, just to build on what Padraig was saying, we ended last year approaching $100 million in revenue in the first quarter. We’re well over that piece, as you can imagine. So I’d say, I think we’re uniquely positioned given all the things that Padraig just said and it’s becoming even bigger component of our growth story going forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you. And then can you talk through how much of the growth in instruments is due to true end market recovery versus replacements being driven by the Infinity III launch? And then any updates on how that launch is impacting your overall win rates?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I mean, if you look at our core on the LC and LCMS side in pharma, which is we grew high-single-digits globally and ex-China we grew double-digits actually on that. And, what we’re seeing is a continued improvement in pharma’s willingness on CapEx spending, undertaking opportunities in PFAS and GLP-1s as well. Infinity III has gone extremely well for us. We’re seeing significant rise in win rates. We’re seeing of course that the productivity gains that this system gives out is resonating with customers extremely well. And as we look at our, refresh of our installed base, whether it’s 1100s, 1260s or 1290s, there’s a lot of opportunity there. Some of that is actually spurred by end of support on the 1100 side in some areas. So, we’re seeing our tech refresh momentum has really started around the Infinity III. So, really good momentum.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Padraig, maybe just on China. I know you talked about seeing an out-sized share from the China stimulus I know when we chatted a month ago, you guys were pretty positive on that piece as well. Felt like you were getting more than your fair share given where those dollars are going. It felt like a little more GCs and industrial. Can you just talk about what you’re seeing there, the traction? It feels like there could be some nice upside there. I know that there’s more tenders coming as well. So it would be helpful to talk through China stimulus and the impact around GCs and the industrial piece.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No, thanks, Patrick. And we did saw a really nice uplift to our excellent performance and winning outside share of the tenders and the national stimulus program. The total stimulus demand for Q1 was around $35 million and we recognized all of that in the quarter. We won 50% of all stimulus orders. And with this round, our China team is now expecting the next round of stimulus to come later in the year. That’s yet to be quantified. It is going to be broad and I think it’s going to be slightly more fragmented in the type of customers. But the size of that round is really not clear as of yet. So, but I think, at this point, we’re not assuming that all stimulus we booked in Q1 would be fully incremental for the year. I think that’s important to say. We expect that some of that is likely pull-forward and our thinking is about [50%] (ph) of that is pull-forward. And we did not see a meaningful improvement in the underlying business in Q1. What I would say the China market is stable and we’re otherwise maintaining our expectation on the base business, resulting in a modest increase for FY ‘25 expectations. And while we’re increasing our expectations for the year, the total remains within our low-single-digit guide range.\nPatrick Donnelly: And Bob, are you rolling that second tender into the guide or will that be upside?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes, that’s a good question, Patrick. We’re staying consistent with how we did it in the beginning of the year, which is, we have not rolled any incremental into the guide. So, that would be a source of upside, Patrick, once we understand more about what the scope and timing of that will be. We do believe that based on the folks, our team on the ground that it will happen in the second quarter of the second half of this year, whether that shows up in our second or third and fourth quarter, or by the end of the calendar year still be determined. But needless to say, we are very optimistic given our strong performance in this first cycle and the fact that we have a strong ability to produce all of our products in China before China.\nPatrick Donnelly: Yes. That’s helpful. And then maybe just on the NASD business, can you talk about what you’re seeing there? I know last quarter you talked about high-single-digit growth expectations, maybe some potential for double-digits. So, we’d love to hear the latest thoughts there. Any color commercial versus clinical would obviously be helpful as well.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I’ll kick it off and I’ll hand it over to Simon. So, very much as expected in Q1, demand continues to be very strong. No change in guidance for the year, which is guiding at high-single-digits and of course nudging to low-double-digit target. But Simon, you want to add more color?\nSimon May: Yes. I think you said it well Padraig, demand very much in-line with expectations, revenue profile also in-line with the expectation, the full-year outlook remains absolutely intact. I think we still have a dynamic in NASD, which bodes very well for the future where we’ve got a lot of process qualification work for molecules that are headed towards the commercial space. And that coupled with the order intake patterns that we’ve been seeing for quite a while now make us very enthusiastic for the future. So confident about the ‘25 guide and even more confident and enthusiastic about the longer-term.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. This is Jack on for Tycho. Appreciate you taking our question. I guess just one on the replacement cycle. Appreciate the color on Infinity III and kind of the influence there. I guess any other data points that spike out to help us understand where we sit today, and kind of better understand the shape and pace of the replacement cycle and how it could play out over the next two to three years?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I mean, LC replacements, it happens at different times within different installed bases and so on. What I will say about, us in terms of Infinity III, it really has kicked off that replacement cycle. And, what we’ve seen is that typically, the replacement cycle is about nine to 12 months. And because of our installed base and a lot of 1100s out there that are some of those are coming to end of support, it really has created momentum around it. So, we expect that to be a steady replacement cycle. We don’t expect the super cycle in any particular quarter, but as we move forward, our installed base will move with it. What I will say as well, we’ve made significant improvements in our lifecycle management process. So how we can look at where the installed base is, how we can inform customers for better productivity and so on. And the good news is Infinity III has all those capabilities.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Jack, maybe just to build on what Padraig is saying is, I would say we’re in the still in the early stages of that recovery. We had a very strong performance in Q1 with the uptake of Infinity III. The feedback continues to be very positive. And I would also look at when we look at the average age of our installed base is still older than normal, and so, we’re very excited about this. I would also say that order growth outpaced revenue growth in the quarter. So again, another positive instance. And that’s on top of overcoming Chinese Lunar New Year, that’s across the board. So, certainly, early days very positive for all the things that Padraig was talking about in the call. And I think there’s a long runway here, for us to be able to take advantage of not only our own installed base, but also, competitive installed base as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Padraig, you mentioned, I think early in the script, some changes in the management layers within Agilent. Is there any additional color you can share on what you’re doing? And then just is there any associated savings, attached to that that you would call out? Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks, Jack. So, first of all, we layered we talked about our new organizational structure at the Investor Day at JPMorgan. And one of the key elements of our customer centric strategy we introduced was becoming more nimble. That’s going to speed up decision making and also increase innovation. And these changes are absolutely critical to our strategy and we know they’re going to deliver many benefits to our customers. So, what we’re really doing is we’re looking at layers in the organization where we can flatten a little bit, increase our span of control so we can improve our decision making and also get a better coverage in our management layer. And while I would say the focus of this is truly strategic, it really is leading with our strategy. There will be some cost reductions associated with these changes later in the year. And that’s where you have those baked into our guide.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Jack, just if you recall, when we talked about the Ignite savings at the beginning of the year, we talked about some being in the second half, more in the second half. That’s where you’ll see the activities that we’re going through right now.\nJack Meehan: Okay. And then, it’d be great to get an update on BIOVECTRA. It looks like that M&A added $26 million of sales in the quarter. Has your target for the year changed at all? I think I heard $145 million in the model. And can you just talk about how things are going there? Thank you.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I’ll pass this one to Simon to take.\nSimon May: Yes. Thanks for the question. I’d say overall, as we are going through the integration process with BIOVECTRA, we’re increasingly excited about what we’re seeing there. I think the more we get under the hood, the more the capabilities that we have there are resonating with our internal experts and also with our customers. We think it’s still very early inning and we’re absolutely in the sweet spot there with those capabilities and relative to where the book is going with therapeutic modalities. We were slightly soft on revenue in the first quarter. The focus there is really very heavily on bringing certain aspects of the operation up to the Agilent NASD standards with process and quality, and that’s progressing really well. But then with regard to the full year guide, we’re holding to the previous guidance and so no change there.\nJack Meehan: Okay. Thank you, Simon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I guess, Bob, when we report again on your book-to-bill commentary here being about one versus seasonally being built sub-1x, is that being driven by stimulus or perhaps timing of the Chinese New Year? Maybe talk about the book-to-bill trends and what is that signaling?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Vijay, it’s Bob. Yes, actually the Lunar New Year didn’t have a big impact on that. Actually, I would take that as a sign of the continued recovery, particularly in the instrumentation market. We did have an impact or a contribution from the Lunar New Year, but the real big area is both LC and LCMS. So, typically what we see is just because the way our fiscal year is that our first fiscal year because January is the last month of the quarter the instrument book-to-bill is typically lower than one. And so the fact that it’s above one is a very positive sign from our perspective that recovery continues. And as we were saying, it’s really been led by some of the new products in the unique attributes of our, the Infinity III portfolio and has given us or allowed us to have renewed conversations with customers and so forth.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And Padraig, maybe one for you on, I think I heard you mention you’ve identified a few hundred million dollars worth of replacement opportunity. I guess, what is the average age of the fleet? And when you do that math, what is incremental of that few hundred million versus a normal replacement cycle? And when you think about the attach rates on services and chemistry, do you feel like that part of the business is growing mid-to-high singles or where are we on services and consumables?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I’ll take the first step piece and I’ll hand it over to Angelica to give more color on the services and consumables. But we’re older than the median, I would say, of the age of the installed base. And the installed base is very large, very disparate, a lot of different equipment in it. So, we expect that we’re going to see the pace of that change, continually improve throughout the year. And then there’s a huge opportunity there in terms of opportunity for replacements. And also when that comes, of course, we have attach rate with the new Infinity III both on the services on the consumer side. So, I would say as well, just to mention that we did see an improvement at the end of year orders. If not back to pre-COVID days, but there was a sequential improvement in terms of December orders in terms of budget flush versus the previous year, which again was in large part about install base change. And I would say when I talk to lab managers out there and we talk to, high level procurement people there’s a lot of pent up demand for, instrument changes. Lab managers are really pressing that. And we do see the purse strings loosening a bit within our pharma customers. But Angelica on service and consumables?\nAngelica Riemann: Yes. Great. Thanks, Padraig. To add to what you’ve already said, it is going to the replacement cycle is going to occur over a period of time, and it’s probably going to be a mix of some incremental, placements of new instruments as well as replacing some of the aging instruments on the lab bench. And what that really allows us to do is continue our focus on increasing our ability to connect services and consumables as those new instruments are being put into service, and we know that, that motion allows for greater and longer customer lifetime value both in how the customer is using that instrument but also in terms of the continued revenue stream that that generates for Agilent. So, there is upside and incremental opportunity, for sure. Understood.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Couillard : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Bob, can you just help us understand what’s going on with gross margins, down over 130 basis points in the first quarter? Was that in line with your expectations? How much did currency affect that? And what are you expecting kind of the next few quarters?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes, Brandon, what I would say is if we looked at the bottom line, operating profit was in line. Gross margin was a little lower just because of some of the mix of products. It wasn’t anything material and I would expect that to improve throughout the course of the year. If you can imagine, with a large stimulus in China that did have some pressure on our margins at the gross margin level, but very profitable at the operating profit margin. And currency did have an impact as well in Q1, and that impact was roughly 20-30 basis points in the quarter for the total company. And I’d expect some of that to continue throughout the course of the year. We do get some benefit because we do hedge, but still the drop through of that is greater on the gross margin. So, the one thing I would say, Brandon, to offset that is we were actually pleased with the pricing. Padraig mentioned about the pricing. It actually was trending a bit higher than what we had expected in Q1 and are expecting that to continue through the course of the year.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, it’d be great if you could get an update just on the pathology and genomics pieces and how those performed in the first quarter. I think genomics is actually up in the fourth quarter. Can you share an update? It would be helpful. Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I’m going to pass this one to Simon.\nSimon May: Yes. I said genomics was puts and takes in the first quarter. We saw some negative impacts from the funding situation in the U.S. with academia and government. And then on the flip side, we continue to see really strong traction with our Magnus automated NGS prep system that’s on a very strong growth trajectory. And the way the chemistry as well still is pretty a pretty small acorn, but the customer adoption there is looking pretty strong. So, as we look to the full year, I still think we see a path to return to growth in genomics. But again, the near-term headwinds, at least with academic and government funding slightly outweighed the positives from Magnus in the first quarter.\nRobert W. McMahon: And the diagnostics and clinical overall grew 7% and pathology was flat year-over-year, but we see very steady growth rates as we go through the year on that side.\nBrandon Couillard: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, Padraig and team. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, if you could just elaborate a little bit on the China stimulus, we were expecting more orders and maybe more continued orders. And so I’m just trying to understand, so why are you expecting it in the second and the rest of the instrumentations and growth from stimulus potentially in the second half? Maybe can you elaborate, what you saw? What are you hearing from the ground in China?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, the stimulus order was within the food area, within the Chinese customs and government departments. And it was very broad based in terms of instruments that actually held most of our platforms in it. We won 50% of that stimulus order, which is around $35 million and was recognized essentially all of that was recognized in the quarter. That’s a very extremely high, win rate. And of course, we think it’s not all of that is incremental. We believe about half of it is kind of run rate pull forward. Half of that is incremental. And, but it shows when these stimulus come in, the Agilent team can really win its oversized share of it. And as I said before, you know, we’re expecting more stimulus, which we haven’t baked into the guide in the second half. But rest assured, when that arises, the Agilent team will be there to help customers.\nSimon May: Yes. Hey, Puneet, to build on what Padraig is saying, I actually see this as a really positive that we were able to not only get that revenue in, the orders in and actually deliver it, it’s a real testament to the Agilent team. And so it actually gives me increased confidence that when the orders come in, we will get more than our fair share in the second half of the year. So, I think we still feel very optimistic about not just this year, but, you know, if you remember, this is a multi-year kind of stimulus program. And, so, we feel very good about the momentum that we have. I wouldn’t look at it quarter-to-quarter. I look at it year-over-year.\nPadraig McDonnell: And just maybe adding one point. I mean, what is absolutely crucial for those orders, to come in is having met in China capabilities and having our ability now to make all our platforms within China for China is really a significant advantage for us.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Thanks for clarifying that. And then question on the margin side. With Ignite efforts, can you elaborate the margin contribution? You talked about pricing on one end, number of cost efforts and also reducing some of the management changes that you have in place. So just wondering how should we think about the margin contribution? Do you have a target, this year from Ignite? Thank you.\nPadraig McDonnell: I’ll start it off and I’ll hand it over to Bob. So yes, of course, we have a very well defined program as we go through the year. Actually, Ignite is a three year program. And what we said is over the three years, [72] (ph) basis points plus in terms of margin expansion. And of course, all of this doesn’t happen all at once, right? So we’ve seen early benefits both from the procurement, direct and indirect procurement side and from pricing in terms of what we’re seeing. But of course, we’ll see more in the second half and as we go into next year. But Bob, I don’t know if you want to give more color on that.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. I was going to say, we’re on track with what we had talked about at the beginning of the year Puneet, which was 50 to 70 basis points this year. We’re going to have to work harder for that because of some of the currency. But pricing has held up here in the quarter and we’re on track, as Padraig mentioned for some of the other areas.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDoug Schenkel: Good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. When we caught up with you guys in January, it sounded like similar to the rest of the peer group, you had a strong December in terms of the instrument budget flush, especially in the pharma end market. And, I guess I’m just wondering if one, I want to confirm that was the case that the end of the fiscal year came together strongly. And if so, it would be interesting to hear if there’s anything, interesting that occurred in terms of a particular rebound in specific instrument categories, specific geographies, specific end markets, and then kind of building off of that. Was January normal? Or did you, you know, kind of go into the second topic I wanted to cover given the change in administration? If December felt a little more normal, did January feel maybe less normal given all the uncertainty in terms of pharma regs, academic funding, food and water testing. Any commentary on all of those things would be really helpful.\nPadraig McDonnell: Okay. Thanks. So, I’ll start off and I’ll hand over to Bob. So, it was certainly as we talked before December, it did play out as we expect us. We did have that strong momentum. And what was driving that, overall demand, I would say particularly around Infinity III, but also we talked about PFAS testing and including, also what we’re seeing in the GLP-I areas. And January new administration comes in a lot of changes. And of course, we’re mitigating those changes as we go through it. The only area where we’ve seen some softness is really in Academia, with NIH funding where things have really slowed down a bit. But of course, that’s a very small part of our business and it’s not within the guide on us. In pharma, when we talk to our customers, actually there’s a lot of questions, you see a lot of discussions around Aira, etcetera, what changes might happen about international pricing index, etcetera. But I would say that hasn’t impacted on the pharma side. We’re still seeing a steady business coming out of that side, but everybody’s really, really watching that. On the PFAS side, just going back to the pharma side as well, people were talking about FDA, changes within the FDA. I think that hit more of the medical device companies, areas within that expertise, but we haven’t seen anything on us yet. And within PFAS, that business continues to be strong. We still see it in January, there’s been no change in that as it happens. So, it’s an area we’re going to continue to watch very, very closely, hugely dynamic. But I would say January is a steady progression from December.\nDoug Schenkel: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. You mentioned a couple of times that you saw an improvement in pharma CapEx. And what I’m curious about is how much of that improvement was narrowly relevant to QAQC versus broader and inclusive of R&D functions in pharma and other product categories in your portfolio like cell analysis?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, I’ll kick it off and maybe hand it to Simon on this one. So, we’re of course, we have heavy fleets and a lot of capabilities when QAQC and development for QAQC. So we saw that across the board on that side. I would say in R&D you see a lot of shifts in terms of where customers are spending money. So, we did actually see a good continuation of positivity on that side. But in the pharma QAQC and the development areas of labs, we’ve seen continued, I would say, steadiness and incremental strength in it driven around a replacement of fleets and driven by the Infinity III. But Simon, I don’t know if you want to add anything to that.\nSimon May: Very little to add on. There was a reference in the question to cell analysis tools and there’s a look at that overall. And actually, so on the academic and government side, we’ve had some impact there in cell analysis with our lower end instrumentation where although at company level, the exposure is very minimal within cell analysis, it’s a little higher. But generally speaking, the funnels are robust in biopharma across the entire continuum. We’re seeing really nice adoption of our NovoCyte Opteon platform, the spectral flow cytometer and the citation C10 is also performing really well. So a few puts and takes in cell analysis.\nDan Leonard: Okay. That’s really helpful. And then a follow-up question. I think, Padraig, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you’ve taken specific actions in response to the tariff talk. Can you elaborate on that?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, no problem. So, we have a very diverse manufacturing capability around and if you talk about the three areas for tariffs, we talked about in Mexico, we have no manufacturing. In Canada, we do have manufacturing with BIOVECTRA, but it’s about 30%, I think is, put into the U.S. And of course, in China, we have in China, China on it. So we believe the overall impact is about $5 million and we actually believe that’s very mitigated bodes down to much less than that and we’re working on it. Just to give you a sense of it, we were able to shift our supply chain pretty quickly in areas from, say, China back into the U.S. and, into Singapore as well, which really is very mitigatable.\nDan Leonard: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with BofA. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks guys. Maybe a little bit of cleanup, but you’ve touched on this a couple of times in terms of the academic government. I just kind of want to make sure I understand the timing of it. If I’m just going to go back to the slide deck, the negative seven in the quarter, you call out softness globally and then anticipated slowdown in government spending, impacts willingness to some customers are staying. So, is this things you started seeing back in November, December? I’m just trying to think of the timing of what was happening in the quarter as it relates to election, inauguration, all of that. Any clarity there would be helpful.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Mike, this is Bob. What we saw actually was a pretty consistent performance across all of the regions. So, they were all down. So that’s what we were talking about when we did see globally. We did see maybe a slight more in January incremental softness towards the end as people were trying to figure out the NAH activity. I wouldn’t say that necessarily is super material for us. And as you know, the Academia and government can be kind of lumpy at times. So, the one area that I would say got disproportionate impact actually was China and a lot of that is some of the impact of the timing of the Lunar New Year. And so, I think that they were the most negative for the full Q1. And that we have a slightly larger exposure in Academia and government in China than we do relative to the rest of the world. So, I wouldn’t read too much into it. Hopefully, that kind of clarifies, kind of what we were seeing.\nMichael Ryskin: Yes. It does. It does. And I think, I mean, just right now in response to, I think Dan’s question, you’re talking about cell analysis specifically. Is that just another area where you have overlap where it’s concentrated in a handful of different parts of the portfolio? I imagine there’s not a lot of GCs going into academic and government labs.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. That’s the true statement. And again in cell analysis the way I’d characterize it is that we began to see hesitancy in Academia and government in the run up to the election last year. People were kind of in wait and see mode to see what happened with the election. Now what we’re starting to see, of course, is that the impacts are real. And just to say, again, in cell analysis, we’ve got proportionally higher exposure there in Academia and government than we do in many, if not all, other parts of our portfolio. So, your statement there about the relative impact is a true one and we don’t see that elsewhere.\nMichael Ryskin: All right. Thanks. That’s helpful.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Eve Burstein with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nEve Burstein: Thanks a lot for taking the question. This has been asked a couple of ways, but maybe just to follow-up on Mike’s question for academic and government. You said you were starting to see a little bit of softness at the end of January. How is that trending into February? Can you just give us a take now where you stand today?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. What I would say is, that’s why we have a little wider guidance in the Q2 guide between the low and the high. And we have, I wouldn’t say it’s any materially different than what we saw in January from a trends perspective. It hasn’t deteriorated, but we’re just being prudent there from a standpoint of, what potentially would be there. And then, for the full year, we’re not changing our guidance.\nEve Burstein: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. And then we’ve talked quite a bit about the LC replacement cycle. Within GC, is there opportunity for an upcycle here as well? You’ve mentioned several times that in LC different customers, different applications are going to improve at different times. But how do you anticipate GC playing out, through the rest of the year in terms of improvement pace timing? And can you just give a little color there?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No. That’s a great question. And of course, GC replacement is a different timing than LCs, because of the technology. But I’m going to ask Mike Zhang to give some color here.\nMike Zhang: Yes. Thank you, Padraig. Obviously, we have, strong leadership in the GC market and we’re very, very strong install base. And we actually have introduced a new GCMS to the market and we’re seeing very strong response from customers. So, yes, we’re very optimistic about opportunities, but certainly it will be again it’s over time, it’s annual long term opportunity. So, we’re very excited about that.\nEve Burstein: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: And Mr. Ahuja, I turn the call back over to you.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Regina, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. With that we would like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2025 Agilent Technologies Inc. Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Parmeet Ahuja, you may begin the conference.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, Regina, and welcome everyone to Agilent’s conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Simon May, President of the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group; Angelica Riemann, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group; and Mike Zhang, President of the Applied Markets Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The press release for our first quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today’s discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are available on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today’s comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You’ll find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we implemented certain changes to our reporting structure related to reorganization of our three business segments. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes and have provided the financial details on our website. These changes have no impact on our company’s consolidated financial statements. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company’s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risk and other factors. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Thank you, Parmeet, and thanks to all of you for joining today’s call. As you saw in our press release, we had a very solid start to the year, exceeding our expectations for core revenue growth and EPS. Before diving into the details, I want to first follow-up on conversations I had with many of you starting at our Analyst and Investor Day in December at the New York Stock Exchange and provide an update on progress of our Ignite Transformation. We’ve stated that Ignite is for our customers, employees, and shareholders. For customers, we want to create a seamless experience across Agilent products, software, and services. For our employees, we want to become nimbler and reduce complexity to enhance our ability to serve our customers. And for shareholders, we want to deliver industry-leading shareholder value through differentiated growth. We have set targets to grow core revenues between 5% and 7% annually, expand our operating margin by 50 to 100 plus basis points per year, and deliver double-digit EPS growth. Right now, I want to share three notable accomplishments from the Ignite Transformation that focus on setting a new pricing mechanisms, elevating our digital ecosystem, and identifying procurement opportunities. First, the creation of an Enterprise strategic-pricing organization that will focus on setting our standard approach for pricing across the entire solution set with the customer and not just at a tactical bottoms-up product level. Second, our digital ecosystem, a critical enabler in our evolved strategy we unveiled at Investor Day continues to be a key area of investment for us. Already, we have made meaningful improvements to our website, upgrading the user experience on our e-commerce platform by making it easier to find and purchase the products our customers need, helping driving topline growth. In Q1, our progress continued with digital orders growing high-single-digits. And third, our procurement teams have challenged our historical approach and are identifying significant cost-savings opportunities in many of Agilent’s functions. Also related to our Ignite Transformation, we’re assessing our organizational health. On my first day as CEO, I promised our employees we would become a nimbler organization to make decisions faster and accelerate innovation in service of our customers. As a result, we are removing some management layers and increasing spans of control. This is a continuation of our new organizational structure we announced in late November. Through that reorganization, we’re seeing our business leaders in lockstep on our strategy and transformation. This alignment enables us to make business decisions faster on priorities and trade-offs. As my leadership team and I look forward, we are focused on growing Agilent. A foundational element of growth is innovation, innovation that our customers want. Every time I visit a customer in any part of the world, they say the same thing; they want to partner with Agilent for better outcomes. That’s what differentiates Agilent, the deep scientific knowledge of our customer-facing team members that our competitors simply can’t duplicate. Customers want everything from the ability to parse massive amounts of data in seconds, to automating more tasks so they can focus on complex scientific challenges. In essence, they want to increase their productivity. That’s why driving lab productivity is among our key priorities. You can see evidence of this in our collaborative agreement with Zurich-based ABB Robotics to produce automated laboratory solutions, ones that will help our customers find new ways of improved workflows and make operations more efficient and flexible. These are customers across multiple markets, including pharma, biotech, energy, and food. Together with ABB, Agilent can transform the customer lab operations by making workflow processes for research, development, and quality control faster and more efficient. The goal is for all instruments, robots, and software to be interoperable, which is crucial to significantly boosting productivity for our customers. Our customers want to buy whole product solutions not just a single instrument. To illustrate that, our Infinity III series that we introduced in October has seen great adoption from all our customers. As a reminder, the Infinity III has an advanced automation that simplifies our customers’ daily routines and is compatible with previous generations, which allows for seamless upgrades and technology refreshes. And that has become a differentiator. Customers are saying that the backward compatibility combined with the modularity of Agilent systems allows them to decide how to upgrade and refresh their instruments. Plus, they’re telling us that they’re choosing Agilent because of our longstanding quality and technology leadership that’s been further enforced with the Infinity III. And the Agilent InfinityLab LC Solutions are certified by My Green Lab. These instruments optimize lab space, and they reduce water, solvent, and energy consumption while also minimizing waste. We continue to see strong momentum and growth in our sales funnel for the Infinity III because of its advanced automation that empowers our customers to be more productive and because of InfinityLab Assist, our automation software that provides on-board intelligence. So, our customers are not simply buying a platform, but a whole product solution. Just as exciting is that the great success of our Infinity III provides Agilent an incredible opportunity for us to upgrade our customers’ instruments. And it’s already happening across our legacy LC platforms, representing an opportunity in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming years. Now, I’d like to highlight some key aspects of our Q1 results. As you can see from our press release, we drove topline year-over-year growth while macro market trends, such as CapEx spending, continue to improve. Our revenue of $1.681 billion increased 1% over the same quarter in FY ‘24. This result exceeded our expectations and was led by excellent growth in PFAS and capturing an outsized share of the China stimulus awards. Our instrument book-to-bill was greater than one in Q1, a quarter when it’s typically less than one. This is another sign of market recovery, but more importantly, it’s a testament to our intense customer focus with products such as the highly successful Infinity III and our success driving our market-leading position in China. Additionally, we exceeded expectations in all regions and end markets except for Academia and Government. In our end markets, revenue was led by Food, which grew 9% driven by our success in capturing stimulus orders in China. In China, our accelerating share gains were apparent in recording a win rate of more than 50% on stimulus-related tenders. With our long history in the region elevated by our local manufacturing capabilities, we are well-positioned to expand our market leadership in China. Now, let me talk about our businesses and some growth vectors in each. Our Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group grew 1% in the quarter, reporting $647 million. Performance was driven by a nice result in our LC and LCMS instruments, which grew high-single-digits during the quarter on the heels of our Infinity III launch. Within LDG, we remain focused on the integration of BIOVECTRA and we are delighted by the response we’re hearing from our existing and potential customers who are interested in leveraging BIOVECTRA’s unique capabilities and Agilent’s expertise. It’s clear that BIOVECTRA’s capabilities are in the sweet spot of tremendous markets with a terrific growth potential. The Agilent CrossLab Group grew 3%, reporting $696 million, which was in-line with our expectations, led by services. We are especially excited about the new ACG that now includes services, automation, consumables, and software and informatics. Software and informatics are among our key priorities, and we’ve had an overwhelmingly positive response to both our InfinityLab Assist automation software and our OpenLab CDS. The InfinityLab automation software offers remote notifications, trouble shootings, diagnostics, and maintenance that paves the way for a fully-automated, digital lab. And our OpenLab CDS provides time-saving steps in analysis, interpretation, and reporting workflows while technical controls ensure work quality, effective records management, and enhanced data security. In short, software is an incredible area of opportunity for us that we are poised to capitalize upon. Already, customers are telling us that InfinityLab Assist and OpenLab offer differentiated functionality and solutions in high-throughput environments. Our Applied Markets Group reported $338 million in the quarter, a 2% decline better than expected related to a strong China stimulus orders. We are very pleased with our team’s ability to compete and win these tenders. We continue to invest in the Applied Markets for next-generation technology innovation and, as I said, support our customers with lab productivity. Every customer we meet has expressed a desire to partner with Agilent to make better use of their instrument fleets to integrate with front-end solutions. And, we’re happy to help them find ways to create customized solutions so they can deliver products faster. Before I hand over to Bob, I want to address topics that have been in the news of late. Regarding the recent news around tariffs, we have a diversified supply chain with a manufacturing presence in all major regions of the world. Our teams already are taking action to mitigate the impacts on our business. In terms of potential reductions to NIH funding, as we’ve shared with you before, our exposure to NIH-related programs is limited to around 1% of our revenue. We currently believe the forecasted impact is manageable within our current guidance. Bob, will now delve deeper on our Q1 results, as well as our outlook for Q2. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Bob?\nRobert W. McMahon: Thanks Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I’ll then cover our updated full-year and second quarter guidance. As Padraig mentioned, Q1 revenue was $1.68 billion, just above the top-end of guidance despite the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter. On a core basis, we posted growth of 1.2%, beating expectations. Adjusting for the timing of Lunar New Year impacts, core growth is estimated to be just over 3%. On a reported basis, growth was 1.4%. Currency had a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points, which was over one percentage point higher than estimated at the start of the quarter. And M&A contributed 1.6%. Padraig already discussed our business group results, so I’ll focus on deeper details about our end markets. We exceeded expectations in all of our end markets except for our smallest one, Academia and Government. Our business in the Food market grew 9%, benefiting from our excellent performance in China’s national stimulus program. In Environmental and Forensics, we grew 6% as we continue to leverage our best-in-class PFAS workflow solutions to grow our market-leading position. We continue to capitalize on the strong demand for PFAS testing that we are seeing globally. Our 6495 triple quad LCMS is the most complete instrument in the PFAS testing market with a specific performance edge in small and fragile molecules where many of the emerging PFAS exist. Along with our new offerings in PFAS-specific consumables and our workflow deployment services, Agilent provides the fastest, highest-quality and most reliable way for customers to add or expand PFAS testing capabilities in their labs. Now looking across all end markets, PFAS grew 70% in the quarter, contributing 75 basis points of growth to the company. Pharma was flat during the quarter, with low-single-digit growth ex-China offset by a high-single-digit decline in China. Globally biopharma and small molecule performed roughly in-line with the overall market. In Chemical and Advanced Materials, revenue declined 2% with growth ex-China offset by a high-teens decline in China, which was mostly impacted by the timing of the Lunar New Year. Our business in the Diagnostics and Clinical end market grew 7%, led by strong results in the Americas and Europe. Academia and Government, our smallest market, saw a decline of 7%, with soft results around the globe. Now moving on to our regional performance, the Americas grew 3%, Europe grew 2%, and Asia ex-China grew 2%, all slightly ahead of expectations. China revenue declined 4%, also better than expectations, on the strength of our stimulus performance. For your models, we estimate that Lunar New Year was a $10 million revenue headwind in the quarter, which we expect to come back in the second quarter. This compares to a $25 million favorable Lunar New Year impact in the first quarter of last year, so combined a 2 percentage point year-on-year impact. Now, let’s move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 54.7% in the quarter, down versus last year primarily due to mix, currency and the Lunar New Year timing. We drove operating margins of 25.1%, roughly in-line with our expectations, despite currency headwinds. While down versus last year, we expect improvement throughout the year as the results of our Ignite Transformation continue to deliver. And below the line, our net interest expense was better than expected as was our tax rate of 12.5%. And we had $287 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q1 earnings per share were $1.31. That was ahead of our expectations and up 2% from a year ago, growing slightly faster than revenue. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $431 million in the quarter, and we invested $97 million in capital expenditures. We purchased $90 million in shares and paid out $71 million through dividends during the quarter. And, we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.0. In summary, we had a good start to the year, and expect continued steady improvement in the market through the year. Now, let’s move on to our outlook for the fiscal year and the second quarter. While we exceeded core growth expectations for Q1, we are maintaining our core growth guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% for the year. This guidance incorporates an element of prudence reflecting the uncertainty over the U.S. federal funding environment, even though it is a small part of our business. However, we are adjusting our full-year reported revenue to be in the range of $6.68 billion to $6.76 billion to reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. If you recall our initial guidance back in November incorporated only a very modest FX headwind. Since then, the U.S. dollar has appreciated and based on current exchange rates, we are now projecting an incremental $110 million in currency headwinds relative to our prior guidance. Currency is now expected to represent a 1.9% headwind for the year versus a prior 20 basis point headwind. We also have left our M&A guidance unchanged at plus 2.0% to 2.2% revenue impact for the year. Full-year, non-GAAP earnings per share are unchanged at $5.54 to $5.61, representing an increase of 4.7% to 6.0%. Relative to our prior guide, currency net of hedging is an estimated additional $0.09 headwind for the year, which we are covering. This assumes flat other income and expense, a 12.5% tax rate, and $286 million diluted shares outstanding. Now for the second quarter, we are guiding to revenue of $1.61 billion to $1.65 billion. This range is a bit wider than we typically use for the upcoming quarter, reflecting the uncertainty around U.S. Federal Government spending. This range represents an increase of 2.5% to 5% growth on a core basis and an increase of 2.4% to 4.9% growth on a reported basis. Currency is a 2.1% headwind, and M&A impact is expected to be a 2% benefit for the quarter. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28, representing growth of 2.5% to 4.9%. Year-on-year currency net of hedging is expected to be a $0.02 headwind to EPS. Now, I would like to turn the call over back to Padraig for closing comments. Padraig?\nPadraig McDonnell: Thanks, Bob. Before we end the call, I want to take this opportunity to highlight more of the Agilent team’s tremendous work. This quarter, the World Economic Forum named our factories in Shanghai, China and Penang, Malaysia, as Global Lighthouse Networks. This recognizes Agilent for its breakthroughs in scaling AI, 3D printing, robotics, big-data analytics, and industrial internet of things. I was delighted to be able to accept those awards in person this year at the Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Shanghai and Penang are two of four Agilent manufacturing sites that have earned this prestigious distinction. In 2022, the Forum named our Singapore and Waldbronn, Germany, sites as Lighthouses. Still today, Agilent is the only analytical and clinical laboratory technology company in the world to be recognized by the World Economic Forum. Also during the quarter, Newsweek ranked Agilent No. 10 out of 600 on its 2025 list of America’s Most Responsible Companies up seven places from 2024. This is our sixth consecutive year on the prestigious list and is a recognition of Agilent being a leading sustainable lab partner to our customers. We are proud to be among the U.S. based companies who are making a positive global impact. At Agilent, we’re only at the start of our Ignite Transformation journey and already we’re seeing early benefits like the ones I described at the start of this call. In less than nine months, we’ve made incredible changes that are improving our customers’ productivity in an era when the pace of science is faster than ever. We’re also becoming nimbler for our employees to better serve our customers. The outcome we’re enabling is faster decision making so that we can accelerate innovation and create differentiated growth. And that, in turn, leads to industry-leading shareholder value. What we are doing at Agilent is turning a good company into a great one. We are committed to continuous improvement and adapting to changing market dynamics. Thank you for joining today’s call. Let’s move to Q&A. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Good afternoon, and thanks so much for taking the questions. So first up, I just kind of wanted to dig into some of this prudence that you mentioned in the guide. Obviously, you’re talking up some of the progress that you guys have seen on your orderbook, but you’re also acknowledging some of that headline risk that we’ve seen on the funding side the last month and a half or so. So, could you quantify for us what level of headline risk can be really embedded into not only the fiscal 2Q guide, but the full-year guide at this point? And then have you seen any impact so far from customers and what are you really seeing from your sales teams that are boots on the ground?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, thanks for the question, Rachel. You know, our guide is a prudent one as we see a lot of changes happening. I will say from our customer base and particularly in our pharma base, activity has increased. The sentiment is increasing as we talk to our customers. Of course, things are, on the macro side are changing with NIH funding, which were less than 1% and, of course, tariffs, which we can mitigate. So, I would say our guide is as a prudent one, but we’ll be able to monitor that as we go through the next quarters. But Bob, I don’t know if you want to add more detail.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Rachel, good afternoon. And to your point, around the prudence, we did raise, increase the range for our second quarter guide to roughly $40 million in between the low and the high. It’s typically anywhere from $25 million to $30 million. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our NIH funding is roughly 1% at the maximum. And so, given the strength that we had in the first quarter and the fact that we’re not raising guide, we feel that we’re well compensating any potential downside. And to Padraig’s point, we haven’t seen any of that materially impact our business, and the activity in our customers.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. And then just on my follow-up, I hate to ask specifically on FX, but I think it’s a question that a lot of us have on the line here. Can you just walk us through how much of the EPS number in the fiscal 2Q number especially is impacted by that FX given how much rates have really moved within the quarter? And then same idea just on the margin front, especially around that 2Q and for the full-year at all, what would that look like without these FX impacts? Thanks.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes, that’s a great question, Rachel. So, let me give you a little more data. So for the full-year, that incremental $110 million is a $0.09 impact for the full-year, as I mentioned before, and that really is roughly a 50 basis point headwind to the overall company that we’re covering. If I look at it for second quarter, it’s about a $30 million, $32 million headwind in the quarter, roughly 2.1% and it’s $0.02 to $0.03 in the quarter, and roughly the same kind of impact from a profitability standpoint.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Ebie on for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one, can you talk through the opportunities within PFAS given the 70% growth you saw in the quarter? How much of this demand is coming from Europe following the packaging regulation? And then also, what do you think the growth contribution going forward could look like for this market?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks for the question. So, the demand for PFAS solutions remains extremely strong. During Q1, the solutions growth accounted for 75 basis points at a company level. And while most of the volume came on the environmental side, we’re seeing actually exceptional growth in food and chemical materials as well. And the opportunity in Q1 grew 70%, but also if you look at that compared to Q4 was 50%, it was a big step up in growth rates. And, with the environmental market still accounts for the largest part of the PFAS revenues. We saw increased customer purchasing in the CAM market, with water discharge in some of those areas. And really we see, all regions doing well. We saw a little bit of a pause in China, which had a great sequential quarter of growth in PFAS. But that’s normal as labs tool up on the equipment side. Europe was very strong and we expect that to be very strong. And, this is a market and this is an area where it’s going to continue to morph and grow depending on new regulations and expanding into new modalities. And I will say, at the core of this is our 6595D triple quad, which is the leading sensitivity in the market, which helps with emerging PFAS characterization and of course our ability to offer consumables and workflow deployment services are really important as customers get set up quickly in their labs.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. And Ebie, just to build on what Padraig was saying, we ended last year approaching $100 million in revenue in the first quarter. We’re well over that piece, as you can imagine. So I’d say, I think we’re uniquely positioned given all the things that Padraig just said and it’s becoming even bigger component of our growth story going forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you. And then can you talk through how much of the growth in instruments is due to true end market recovery versus replacements being driven by the Infinity III launch? And then any updates on how that launch is impacting your overall win rates?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I mean, if you look at our core on the LC and LCMS side in pharma, which is we grew high-single-digits globally and ex-China we grew double-digits actually on that. And, what we’re seeing is a continued improvement in pharma’s willingness on CapEx spending, undertaking opportunities in PFAS and GLP-1s as well. Infinity III has gone extremely well for us. We’re seeing significant rise in win rates. We’re seeing of course that the productivity gains that this system gives out is resonating with customers extremely well. And as we look at our, refresh of our installed base, whether it’s 1100s, 1260s or 1290s, there’s a lot of opportunity there. Some of that is actually spurred by end of support on the 1100 side in some areas. So, we’re seeing our tech refresh momentum has really started around the Infinity III. So, really good momentum.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Padraig, maybe just on China. I know you talked about seeing an out-sized share from the China stimulus I know when we chatted a month ago, you guys were pretty positive on that piece as well. Felt like you were getting more than your fair share given where those dollars are going. It felt like a little more GCs and industrial. Can you just talk about what you’re seeing there, the traction? It feels like there could be some nice upside there. I know that there’s more tenders coming as well. So it would be helpful to talk through China stimulus and the impact around GCs and the industrial piece.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No, thanks, Patrick. And we did saw a really nice uplift to our excellent performance and winning outside share of the tenders and the national stimulus program. The total stimulus demand for Q1 was around $35 million and we recognized all of that in the quarter. We won 50% of all stimulus orders. And with this round, our China team is now expecting the next round of stimulus to come later in the year. That’s yet to be quantified. It is going to be broad and I think it’s going to be slightly more fragmented in the type of customers. But the size of that round is really not clear as of yet. So, but I think, at this point, we’re not assuming that all stimulus we booked in Q1 would be fully incremental for the year. I think that’s important to say. We expect that some of that is likely pull-forward and our thinking is about [50%] (ph) of that is pull-forward. And we did not see a meaningful improvement in the underlying business in Q1. What I would say the China market is stable and we’re otherwise maintaining our expectation on the base business, resulting in a modest increase for FY ‘25 expectations. And while we’re increasing our expectations for the year, the total remains within our low-single-digit guide range.\nPatrick Donnelly: And Bob, are you rolling that second tender into the guide or will that be upside?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes, that’s a good question, Patrick. We’re staying consistent with how we did it in the beginning of the year, which is, we have not rolled any incremental into the guide. So, that would be a source of upside, Patrick, once we understand more about what the scope and timing of that will be. We do believe that based on the folks, our team on the ground that it will happen in the second quarter of the second half of this year, whether that shows up in our second or third and fourth quarter, or by the end of the calendar year still be determined. But needless to say, we are very optimistic given our strong performance in this first cycle and the fact that we have a strong ability to produce all of our products in China before China.\nPatrick Donnelly: Yes. That’s helpful. And then maybe just on the NASD business, can you talk about what you’re seeing there? I know last quarter you talked about high-single-digit growth expectations, maybe some potential for double-digits. So, we’d love to hear the latest thoughts there. Any color commercial versus clinical would obviously be helpful as well.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I’ll kick it off and I’ll hand it over to Simon. So, very much as expected in Q1, demand continues to be very strong. No change in guidance for the year, which is guiding at high-single-digits and of course nudging to low-double-digit target. But Simon, you want to add more color?\nSimon May: Yes. I think you said it well Padraig, demand very much in-line with expectations, revenue profile also in-line with the expectation, the full-year outlook remains absolutely intact. I think we still have a dynamic in NASD, which bodes very well for the future where we’ve got a lot of process qualification work for molecules that are headed towards the commercial space. And that coupled with the order intake patterns that we’ve been seeing for quite a while now make us very enthusiastic for the future. So confident about the ‘25 guide and even more confident and enthusiastic about the longer-term.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. This is Jack on for Tycho. Appreciate you taking our question. I guess just one on the replacement cycle. Appreciate the color on Infinity III and kind of the influence there. I guess any other data points that spike out to help us understand where we sit today, and kind of better understand the shape and pace of the replacement cycle and how it could play out over the next two to three years?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I mean, LC replacements, it happens at different times within different installed bases and so on. What I will say about, us in terms of Infinity III, it really has kicked off that replacement cycle. And, what we’ve seen is that typically, the replacement cycle is about nine to 12 months. And because of our installed base and a lot of 1100s out there that are some of those are coming to end of support, it really has created momentum around it. So, we expect that to be a steady replacement cycle. We don’t expect the super cycle in any particular quarter, but as we move forward, our installed base will move with it. What I will say as well, we’ve made significant improvements in our lifecycle management process. So how we can look at where the installed base is, how we can inform customers for better productivity and so on. And the good news is Infinity III has all those capabilities.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Jack, maybe just to build on what Padraig is saying is, I would say we’re in the still in the early stages of that recovery. We had a very strong performance in Q1 with the uptake of Infinity III. The feedback continues to be very positive. And I would also look at when we look at the average age of our installed base is still older than normal, and so, we’re very excited about this. I would also say that order growth outpaced revenue growth in the quarter. So again, another positive instance. And that’s on top of overcoming Chinese Lunar New Year, that’s across the board. So, certainly, early days very positive for all the things that Padraig was talking about in the call. And I think there’s a long runway here, for us to be able to take advantage of not only our own installed base, but also, competitive installed base as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Padraig, you mentioned, I think early in the script, some changes in the management layers within Agilent. Is there any additional color you can share on what you’re doing? And then just is there any associated savings, attached to that that you would call out? Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks, Jack. So, first of all, we layered we talked about our new organizational structure at the Investor Day at JPMorgan. And one of the key elements of our customer centric strategy we introduced was becoming more nimble. That’s going to speed up decision making and also increase innovation. And these changes are absolutely critical to our strategy and we know they’re going to deliver many benefits to our customers. So, what we’re really doing is we’re looking at layers in the organization where we can flatten a little bit, increase our span of control so we can improve our decision making and also get a better coverage in our management layer. And while I would say the focus of this is truly strategic, it really is leading with our strategy. There will be some cost reductions associated with these changes later in the year. And that’s where you have those baked into our guide.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Jack, just if you recall, when we talked about the Ignite savings at the beginning of the year, we talked about some being in the second half, more in the second half. That’s where you’ll see the activities that we’re going through right now.\nJack Meehan: Okay. And then, it’d be great to get an update on BIOVECTRA. It looks like that M&A added $26 million of sales in the quarter. Has your target for the year changed at all? I think I heard $145 million in the model. And can you just talk about how things are going there? Thank you.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I’ll pass this one to Simon to take.\nSimon May: Yes. Thanks for the question. I’d say overall, as we are going through the integration process with BIOVECTRA, we’re increasingly excited about what we’re seeing there. I think the more we get under the hood, the more the capabilities that we have there are resonating with our internal experts and also with our customers. We think it’s still very early inning and we’re absolutely in the sweet spot there with those capabilities and relative to where the book is going with therapeutic modalities. We were slightly soft on revenue in the first quarter. The focus there is really very heavily on bringing certain aspects of the operation up to the Agilent NASD standards with process and quality, and that’s progressing really well. But then with regard to the full year guide, we’re holding to the previous guidance and so no change there.\nJack Meehan: Okay. Thank you, Simon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I guess, Bob, when we report again on your book-to-bill commentary here being about one versus seasonally being built sub-1x, is that being driven by stimulus or perhaps timing of the Chinese New Year? Maybe talk about the book-to-bill trends and what is that signaling?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Vijay, it’s Bob. Yes, actually the Lunar New Year didn’t have a big impact on that. Actually, I would take that as a sign of the continued recovery, particularly in the instrumentation market. We did have an impact or a contribution from the Lunar New Year, but the real big area is both LC and LCMS. So, typically what we see is just because the way our fiscal year is that our first fiscal year because January is the last month of the quarter the instrument book-to-bill is typically lower than one. And so the fact that it’s above one is a very positive sign from our perspective that recovery continues. And as we were saying, it’s really been led by some of the new products in the unique attributes of our, the Infinity III portfolio and has given us or allowed us to have renewed conversations with customers and so forth.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And Padraig, maybe one for you on, I think I heard you mention you’ve identified a few hundred million dollars worth of replacement opportunity. I guess, what is the average age of the fleet? And when you do that math, what is incremental of that few hundred million versus a normal replacement cycle? And when you think about the attach rates on services and chemistry, do you feel like that part of the business is growing mid-to-high singles or where are we on services and consumables?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I’ll take the first step piece and I’ll hand it over to Angelica to give more color on the services and consumables. But we’re older than the median, I would say, of the age of the installed base. And the installed base is very large, very disparate, a lot of different equipment in it. So, we expect that we’re going to see the pace of that change, continually improve throughout the year. And then there’s a huge opportunity there in terms of opportunity for replacements. And also when that comes, of course, we have attach rate with the new Infinity III both on the services on the consumer side. So, I would say as well, just to mention that we did see an improvement at the end of year orders. If not back to pre-COVID days, but there was a sequential improvement in terms of December orders in terms of budget flush versus the previous year, which again was in large part about install base change. And I would say when I talk to lab managers out there and we talk to, high level procurement people there’s a lot of pent up demand for, instrument changes. Lab managers are really pressing that. And we do see the purse strings loosening a bit within our pharma customers. But Angelica on service and consumables?\nAngelica Riemann: Yes. Great. Thanks, Padraig. To add to what you’ve already said, it is going to the replacement cycle is going to occur over a period of time, and it’s probably going to be a mix of some incremental, placements of new instruments as well as replacing some of the aging instruments on the lab bench. And what that really allows us to do is continue our focus on increasing our ability to connect services and consumables as those new instruments are being put into service, and we know that, that motion allows for greater and longer customer lifetime value both in how the customer is using that instrument but also in terms of the continued revenue stream that that generates for Agilent. So, there is upside and incremental opportunity, for sure. Understood.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Couillard : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Bob, can you just help us understand what’s going on with gross margins, down over 130 basis points in the first quarter? Was that in line with your expectations? How much did currency affect that? And what are you expecting kind of the next few quarters?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes, Brandon, what I would say is if we looked at the bottom line, operating profit was in line. Gross margin was a little lower just because of some of the mix of products. It wasn’t anything material and I would expect that to improve throughout the course of the year. If you can imagine, with a large stimulus in China that did have some pressure on our margins at the gross margin level, but very profitable at the operating profit margin. And currency did have an impact as well in Q1, and that impact was roughly 20-30 basis points in the quarter for the total company. And I’d expect some of that to continue throughout the course of the year. We do get some benefit because we do hedge, but still the drop through of that is greater on the gross margin. So, the one thing I would say, Brandon, to offset that is we were actually pleased with the pricing. Padraig mentioned about the pricing. It actually was trending a bit higher than what we had expected in Q1 and are expecting that to continue through the course of the year.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, it’d be great if you could get an update just on the pathology and genomics pieces and how those performed in the first quarter. I think genomics is actually up in the fourth quarter. Can you share an update? It would be helpful. Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I’m going to pass this one to Simon.\nSimon May: Yes. I said genomics was puts and takes in the first quarter. We saw some negative impacts from the funding situation in the U.S. with academia and government. And then on the flip side, we continue to see really strong traction with our Magnus automated NGS prep system that’s on a very strong growth trajectory. And the way the chemistry as well still is pretty a pretty small acorn, but the customer adoption there is looking pretty strong. So, as we look to the full year, I still think we see a path to return to growth in genomics. But again, the near-term headwinds, at least with academic and government funding slightly outweighed the positives from Magnus in the first quarter.\nRobert W. McMahon: And the diagnostics and clinical overall grew 7% and pathology was flat year-over-year, but we see very steady growth rates as we go through the year on that side.\nBrandon Couillard: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, Padraig and team. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, if you could just elaborate a little bit on the China stimulus, we were expecting more orders and maybe more continued orders. And so I’m just trying to understand, so why are you expecting it in the second and the rest of the instrumentations and growth from stimulus potentially in the second half? Maybe can you elaborate, what you saw? What are you hearing from the ground in China?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, the stimulus order was within the food area, within the Chinese customs and government departments. And it was very broad based in terms of instruments that actually held most of our platforms in it. We won 50% of that stimulus order, which is around $35 million and was recognized essentially all of that was recognized in the quarter. That’s a very extremely high, win rate. And of course, we think it’s not all of that is incremental. We believe about half of it is kind of run rate pull forward. Half of that is incremental. And, but it shows when these stimulus come in, the Agilent team can really win its oversized share of it. And as I said before, you know, we’re expecting more stimulus, which we haven’t baked into the guide in the second half. But rest assured, when that arises, the Agilent team will be there to help customers.\nSimon May: Yes. Hey, Puneet, to build on what Padraig is saying, I actually see this as a really positive that we were able to not only get that revenue in, the orders in and actually deliver it, it’s a real testament to the Agilent team. And so it actually gives me increased confidence that when the orders come in, we will get more than our fair share in the second half of the year. So, I think we still feel very optimistic about not just this year, but, you know, if you remember, this is a multi-year kind of stimulus program. And, so, we feel very good about the momentum that we have. I wouldn’t look at it quarter-to-quarter. I look at it year-over-year.\nPadraig McDonnell: And just maybe adding one point. I mean, what is absolutely crucial for those orders, to come in is having met in China capabilities and having our ability now to make all our platforms within China for China is really a significant advantage for us.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Thanks for clarifying that. And then question on the margin side. With Ignite efforts, can you elaborate the margin contribution? You talked about pricing on one end, number of cost efforts and also reducing some of the management changes that you have in place. So just wondering how should we think about the margin contribution? Do you have a target, this year from Ignite? Thank you.\nPadraig McDonnell: I’ll start it off and I’ll hand it over to Bob. So yes, of course, we have a very well defined program as we go through the year. Actually, Ignite is a three year program. And what we said is over the three years, [72] (ph) basis points plus in terms of margin expansion. And of course, all of this doesn’t happen all at once, right? So we’ve seen early benefits both from the procurement, direct and indirect procurement side and from pricing in terms of what we’re seeing. But of course, we’ll see more in the second half and as we go into next year. But Bob, I don’t know if you want to give more color on that.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. I was going to say, we’re on track with what we had talked about at the beginning of the year Puneet, which was 50 to 70 basis points this year. We’re going to have to work harder for that because of some of the currency. But pricing has held up here in the quarter and we’re on track, as Padraig mentioned for some of the other areas.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDoug Schenkel: Good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. When we caught up with you guys in January, it sounded like similar to the rest of the peer group, you had a strong December in terms of the instrument budget flush, especially in the pharma end market. And, I guess I’m just wondering if one, I want to confirm that was the case that the end of the fiscal year came together strongly. And if so, it would be interesting to hear if there’s anything, interesting that occurred in terms of a particular rebound in specific instrument categories, specific geographies, specific end markets, and then kind of building off of that. Was January normal? Or did you, you know, kind of go into the second topic I wanted to cover given the change in administration? If December felt a little more normal, did January feel maybe less normal given all the uncertainty in terms of pharma regs, academic funding, food and water testing. Any commentary on all of those things would be really helpful.\nPadraig McDonnell: Okay. Thanks. So, I’ll start off and I’ll hand over to Bob. So, it was certainly as we talked before December, it did play out as we expect us. We did have that strong momentum. And what was driving that, overall demand, I would say particularly around Infinity III, but also we talked about PFAS testing and including, also what we’re seeing in the GLP-I areas. And January new administration comes in a lot of changes. And of course, we’re mitigating those changes as we go through it. The only area where we’ve seen some softness is really in Academia, with NIH funding where things have really slowed down a bit. But of course, that’s a very small part of our business and it’s not within the guide on us. In pharma, when we talk to our customers, actually there’s a lot of questions, you see a lot of discussions around Aira, etcetera, what changes might happen about international pricing index, etcetera. But I would say that hasn’t impacted on the pharma side. We’re still seeing a steady business coming out of that side, but everybody’s really, really watching that. On the PFAS side, just going back to the pharma side as well, people were talking about FDA, changes within the FDA. I think that hit more of the medical device companies, areas within that expertise, but we haven’t seen anything on us yet. And within PFAS, that business continues to be strong. We still see it in January, there’s been no change in that as it happens. So, it’s an area we’re going to continue to watch very, very closely, hugely dynamic. But I would say January is a steady progression from December.\nDoug Schenkel: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. You mentioned a couple of times that you saw an improvement in pharma CapEx. And what I’m curious about is how much of that improvement was narrowly relevant to QAQC versus broader and inclusive of R&D functions in pharma and other product categories in your portfolio like cell analysis?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, I’ll kick it off and maybe hand it to Simon on this one. So, we’re of course, we have heavy fleets and a lot of capabilities when QAQC and development for QAQC. So we saw that across the board on that side. I would say in R&D you see a lot of shifts in terms of where customers are spending money. So, we did actually see a good continuation of positivity on that side. But in the pharma QAQC and the development areas of labs, we’ve seen continued, I would say, steadiness and incremental strength in it driven around a replacement of fleets and driven by the Infinity III. But Simon, I don’t know if you want to add anything to that.\nSimon May: Very little to add on. There was a reference in the question to cell analysis tools and there’s a look at that overall. And actually, so on the academic and government side, we’ve had some impact there in cell analysis with our lower end instrumentation where although at company level, the exposure is very minimal within cell analysis, it’s a little higher. But generally speaking, the funnels are robust in biopharma across the entire continuum. We’re seeing really nice adoption of our NovoCyte Opteon platform, the spectral flow cytometer and the citation C10 is also performing really well. So a few puts and takes in cell analysis.\nDan Leonard: Okay. That’s really helpful. And then a follow-up question. I think, Padraig, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you’ve taken specific actions in response to the tariff talk. Can you elaborate on that?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, no problem. So, we have a very diverse manufacturing capability around and if you talk about the three areas for tariffs, we talked about in Mexico, we have no manufacturing. In Canada, we do have manufacturing with BIOVECTRA, but it’s about 30%, I think is, put into the U.S. And of course, in China, we have in China, China on it. So we believe the overall impact is about $5 million and we actually believe that’s very mitigated bodes down to much less than that and we’re working on it. Just to give you a sense of it, we were able to shift our supply chain pretty quickly in areas from, say, China back into the U.S. and, into Singapore as well, which really is very mitigatable.\nDan Leonard: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with BofA. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks guys. Maybe a little bit of cleanup, but you’ve touched on this a couple of times in terms of the academic government. I just kind of want to make sure I understand the timing of it. If I’m just going to go back to the slide deck, the negative seven in the quarter, you call out softness globally and then anticipated slowdown in government spending, impacts willingness to some customers are staying. So, is this things you started seeing back in November, December? I’m just trying to think of the timing of what was happening in the quarter as it relates to election, inauguration, all of that. Any clarity there would be helpful.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Mike, this is Bob. What we saw actually was a pretty consistent performance across all of the regions. So, they were all down. So that’s what we were talking about when we did see globally. We did see maybe a slight more in January incremental softness towards the end as people were trying to figure out the NAH activity. I wouldn’t say that necessarily is super material for us. And as you know, the Academia and government can be kind of lumpy at times. So, the one area that I would say got disproportionate impact actually was China and a lot of that is some of the impact of the timing of the Lunar New Year. And so, I think that they were the most negative for the full Q1. And that we have a slightly larger exposure in Academia and government in China than we do relative to the rest of the world. So, I wouldn’t read too much into it. Hopefully, that kind of clarifies, kind of what we were seeing.\nMichael Ryskin: Yes. It does. It does. And I think, I mean, just right now in response to, I think Dan’s question, you’re talking about cell analysis specifically. Is that just another area where you have overlap where it’s concentrated in a handful of different parts of the portfolio? I imagine there’s not a lot of GCs going into academic and government labs.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. That’s the true statement. And again in cell analysis the way I’d characterize it is that we began to see hesitancy in Academia and government in the run up to the election last year. People were kind of in wait and see mode to see what happened with the election. Now what we’re starting to see, of course, is that the impacts are real. And just to say, again, in cell analysis, we’ve got proportionally higher exposure there in Academia and government than we do in many, if not all, other parts of our portfolio. So, your statement there about the relative impact is a true one and we don’t see that elsewhere.\nMichael Ryskin: All right. Thanks. That’s helpful.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Eve Burstein with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nEve Burstein: Thanks a lot for taking the question. This has been asked a couple of ways, but maybe just to follow-up on Mike’s question for academic and government. You said you were starting to see a little bit of softness at the end of January. How is that trending into February? Can you just give us a take now where you stand today?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. What I would say is, that’s why we have a little wider guidance in the Q2 guide between the low and the high. And we have, I wouldn’t say it’s any materially different than what we saw in January from a trends perspective. It hasn’t deteriorated, but we’re just being prudent there from a standpoint of, what potentially would be there. And then, for the full year, we’re not changing our guidance.\nEve Burstein: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. And then we’ve talked quite a bit about the LC replacement cycle. Within GC, is there opportunity for an upcycle here as well? You’ve mentioned several times that in LC different customers, different applications are going to improve at different times. But how do you anticipate GC playing out, through the rest of the year in terms of improvement pace timing? And can you just give a little color there?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No. That’s a great question. And of course, GC replacement is a different timing than LCs, because of the technology. But I’m going to ask Mike Zhang to give some color here.\nMike Zhang: Yes. Thank you, Padraig. Obviously, we have, strong leadership in the GC market and we’re very, very strong install base. And we actually have introduced a new GCMS to the market and we’re seeing very strong response from customers. So, yes, we’re very optimistic about opportunities, but certainly it will be again it’s over time, it’s annual long term opportunity. So, we’re very excited about that.\nEve Burstein: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: And Mr. Ahuja, I turn the call back over to you.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Regina, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. With that we would like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to withdraw your question, again, press star one. Thank you. Parmeet Ahuja, you may begin your conference.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, and welcome everyone to Agilent's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. I am sure you have seen our press release earlier today regarding our new market-focused organizational structure, which we will talk about in more detail. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. All financial metrics and guidance during this call will be shared under our historical structure. We will provide recast historical segment information to reflect these changes ahead of our upcoming investor day. Now onto our quarterly results. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO, and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Phil Binns, President of the former Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group, Simon May, President of the newly formed Life Sciences and Diagnostic Markets Group, and Angelica Riemann, President of the expanded Agilent CrossLab Group. Also joining the call is Mike Zhang, President of the newly formed Applied Markets Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our fourth quarter financial results, investor presentation, and information to supplement today's discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are available on our website at investors.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year, and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past twelve months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risk and other factors. And now I would like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Great. Thank you, Parmeet. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Before I begin, I would like to welcome new AMG President, Mike Zhang. While Mike is new to this role, he is not new to Agilent. Mike joined Agilent more than twenty years ago as a manufacturing engineer in China and most recently was Vice President and General Manager of the GC and GCMS business. Within our former Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group, with his broad experience in both manufacturing and into the business, Mike will be an incredible asset in this role. Very much looking forward to him moving AMG and Agilent forward. I also want to take a moment to wish Phil Binns a wonderful retirement in advance of him leaving Agilent. Phil joined Agilent with the Varian acquisition in 2010. All told, Phil is celebrating just over forty years of service with Agilent and Varian. Although Phil is retiring from the business president role, he has graciously agreed to serve as a special adviser through April 2025. All of us at Agilent wish Phil the very best and look forward to working with him during the last five months at Agilent. Now onto our high-level Q4 results. I am happy to share not only our solid fourth quarter results that point to continued steady market recovery, but also our outlook and drivers for the 2025 fiscal year. I am especially excited to talk about Agilent's customer-first strategy evolution and our aggressive transformation ambition that led to the news you read ahead of the call. The new market-focused organizational structure to become a nimbler, even more customer-centric company to accelerate our performance. In the fourth quarter, the Agilent team delivered revenue of $1.701 billion, roughly one percent reported growth with a flat core growth. This represents a sequential improvement of over four hundred basis points from Q3. In addition, our total company book-to-bill was greater than one. This points to a steady market improvement we are seeing and we expect it to continue in 2025. We also gained share in all our geographies. Evidence that even in challenging CapEx environment, customers trust Agilent. As we evolve, we are confident this will only accelerate. Bob will provide deeper details on our Q4 results and our outlook for Q1 and FY 2025. Now I would like to spend some time talking about our new organization structure we announced earlier today. Our new market-focused organization structure is a result of our customer-centric market force strategy and an important step in our organizational transformation work, which we have named Ignite. This is a product of our enterprise focus strategy that drives our evolution to become a nimbler, even more customer-centric company to accelerate our performance. The new market-focused organization structure is one of the most significant changes Agilent has seen in a decade and continues the work we did creating our commercial organization three years ago. The commercial organization doubled down on our customer-first approach in the field and it's a critical competitive advantage in supporting our customers. At that time, we started by creating a singular commercial leadership structure. We then created a foundational infrastructure and intensified our focus on digital capabilities, accelerated and end-to-end customer experience, and ensured sales channels were customer and market-centric. So changes you see today are part of the successful journey we started three years ago. With the new structure, we are aligning business units to our markets facilitating close collaboration among the businesses like never before and enabling better execution and cross-division customer-first priorities. We are combining the strength of our three businesses as well as our portfolios so that we can offer end-to-end solutions and workflows revolve around our customers and markets. The Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group's or LDG represents $2.5 billion in annual revenue and is primarily focused on our pharma, biopharma, and clinical diagnostic end markets. LDG provides a comprehensive portfolio of leading technology platforms and solutions to serve Agilent's customers' value chain, including research and discovery, development and scale-up, production of therapeutics, and development of critical cancer diagnostics. LDG includes LC and LCMS, cell analysis as well as CDMO capabilities which include NESD and BioVectra. The business also includes pathology, companion diagnostics, and genomics. Simon May will serve as president of LDG prior to joining Agilent earlier this year at Bio-Rad Laboratories. Simon was Executive Vice President and President of Life Science Group. The Applied Markets Group or AMG represents $1.3 billion in annual revenue and is focused on food, environmental, forensics, chemicals, and advanced materials markets. AMG includes GC and GCMS spectroscopy, vacuum technology platforms, and certified pre-owned business. AMG will focus on growing its agile and strong leadership in these markets and accelerating growth in new areas of the market. Mike Zhang, a twenty-two-year veteran of Agilent, has been promoted to president of AMG. Most recently, Mike was Vice President and General Manager of our GC and GCMS product lines. The Agilent CrossLab Group or ACG represents $2.7 billion in annual revenue and is focused on supporting our customers in all our end markets. The group is uniquely positioned to leverage its comprehensive portfolio and capabilities to further enhance the installed base of instruments with targeted workflows and applications that drive critical outcomes and productivity in labs. ACG includes services, software and informatics, automation, and consumables. This business will accelerate and strengthen customer relationships across all end markets. Angelica Riemann, a twenty-five-year veteran of Agilent, will continue to serve as president of ACG. Prior to her current role, she served as Vice President and General Manager of the ACG services business. This change is one of the many that demonstrate how we are becoming nimbler and accelerating the pace of innovation. And you can see that with the Q4 launch of the exciting Agilent Infinity 3 LC series that harnesses our fifty years of LC expertise and leadership. The Infinity 3 series has advanced automation that simplifies our customers' daily routines and is compatible with previous generation, which allows for seamless upgrades and technology refreshes. And Agilent Infinity Lab LC solutions are certified by MyGreenLab. These instruments optimize lab space, and they reduce water, solvent, and energy consumption while also minimizing waste. While just launched in October, early traction from customers has been very positive. Also in Q4, we closed our acquisition of BioVectra, demonstrating our commitment to providing customers the most advanced capabilities to accelerate our therapeutic programs. With BioVectra now being part of Agilent, we expand our portfolio of CDMO services beyond our market-leading oligonucleotide production at NASD. Adding more rapidly growing therapeutic modalities like peptide synthesis, a market expected to continue to expand rapidly over the coming years. And bringing world-class capability to support gene editing therapies. Just last month, my leadership team and I visited BioVectra to welcome our new team members to Agilent, and we became even more accelerated by the capabilities we would be able to harness. Plus both Agilent and BioVectra's focus on putting customer first and accelerating the pace of innovation so we can add to and capitalize on opportunities was abundantly clear as I spoke to dozens of BioVectra employees. Separately, during the quarter, we hit another important milestone. For the full year, we passed the $1 billion mark in digital orders, for the first time across the company. This is a result of our investment in our digital ecosystem to ensure our customers can do business with us in ways that meet their needs. To reinforce what I have stated in previous calls, we are sharply focused on key growth factors such as BioPharma, PFAS, and advanced materials. And the Agilent team has mobilized to accelerate value creation through our Ignite transformation program. The objective of Ignite is to drive revenue growth and margin expansion by increasing our execution capabilities.\nOperator: The world is moving faster than ever,\nPadraig McDonnell: and so are we. That is exactly why we introduced our new market-focused organization structure. We are laser-focused on winning in the marketplace and adding value to our customers and shareholders. We will dive more deeply into these details including our evolved strategy and the Ignite transformation, that will help us execute on that strategy. At our investor day on December seventeenth in New York.\nBob McMahon: We\nPadraig McDonnell: Bob would now provide the details of the results as well as our outlook for the fiscal year of 2025 and the first quarter. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Thank you, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on fourth quarter revenue and take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I will then cover our guidance for fiscal year 2025 and the first quarter of 2025. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Padraig said, we are pleased with our Q4 results. Agilent finished the fourth quarter, with core growth in line with our expectations while EPS exceeded our expectations as we executed well against a challenging albeit improving market. Q4 revenue was $1.701 billion, a decline of 0.3% core but a sequential improvement of over four hundred basis points. On a reported basis, our revenues were up 0.8% as we benefited from fifty basis points of currency and BioVectra contributed sixty basis points. Looking at our Q4 performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $833 million in revenue. That represents a 1% decline as instrument volumes continue to be constrained, by conservative customer CapEx spending while consumables grew mid-single digits. Having said that, for our instruments business, our orders grew year on year and for the third consecutive quarter, our book-to-bill was once again greater than one. We see this as positive evidence of an ongoing steady instrument recovery. Moving on to Agilent CrossLab Group, the business delivered revenue of $426 million for the quarter, 5%. ACG grew in every market and in every region except China, where it was flat year over year but up sequentially. The contracts business including our fast-growing enterprise services business, double digits again in Q4 as it has every quarter this year. Our largest customers continue to maximize utilization of their assets, right-size their operations, and leverage OpEx budgets to deliver on their productivity goals and outcomes. We recently received a top supplier award from one of our largest strategic customers in the applied markets as a recognition of our long-standing and beneficial partnership throughout the years. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $442 million in revenue, representing a 3% decline that was slightly above expectations. Pathology saw solid growth globally, and was offset by expected softness in NESD and cell analysis instruments. Now looking at our end markets and geographies, our largest end market, pharma, declined 1%, slightly better than what we expected. Within pharma, biopharma declined mid-single digits while small molecule grew low single digits. Encouragingly, all regions except for the Americas, grew in the quarter. The Americas region was pressured by the expected decline of NASD. We expect both the Americas region and NASD to return to growth in fiscal year 2025. In chemicals and advanced materials, revenue grew 1% with our advanced materials submarket growing mid-single digits driven by our business in the semiconductor market. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical end market performed strongly growing 7% driven by pathology, and improved performance in genomics.\nOperator: In environmental and forensics,\nBob McMahon: we declined 6% although dollars were roughly flat sequentially. All regions grew except for the US, related to timing of orders. That being said, we continue to see very strong growth in PFAS solutions. With our business growing more than 40% in Q4 across multiple end markets. Now wrapping up our end markets, food was down 3% versus last year. While our academia and government market was down 1%. Geographically, Asia ex-China high single digits and Europe grew low single digits in the quarter while the Americas and China declined as expected. China was down only 3% and exceeded our expectations. We also booked our first China stimulus orders in October and anticipate much more in fiscal year 2025. Now let's move to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 55.1% in the quarter, down seventy basis points versus last year driven by lower volume and mix. Our operating margin was 27.4% as our productivity initiatives and the cost actions we took earlier in the year were fully recognized this quarter. The annualization of these savings coupled with the market recovery and the initial returns from the Ignite transformation, give us confidence in driving EPS growth in fiscal year 2025. In addition, we continue to look for ways to drive EPS growth below the line. Our net interest income was in line while we benefited from a lower tax rate in the quarter and our share count was 287 million diluted shares outstanding. Now putting it all together, Q4 earnings per share was $1.46, that was ahead of our expectations and up 6% from a year ago. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $481 million in the quarter, and we invested $93 million in capital expenditures. For the year, we well exceeded our operating cash flow expectations. With operating cash flow of $1.75 billion during the quarter, we returned over $400 million to shareholders, consisting of $335 million in share repurchases, and $68 million in dividends. For the year, we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders, through repurchasing shares and dividends. Looking forward, you may have also seen recently we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend. Marking another year of increases advancing our industry-leading dividend. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.1, a very strong number even as we acquired BioVectra in the quarter. Our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet provide us with plenty of opportunity to invest in the business going forward. In summary, we performed well and saw steady market improvement in the quarter. We are executing well, staying disciplined, and investing in high-growth opportunities. Now let's move on to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. We expect the recovery that we have seen the past few quarters to continue throughout fiscal 2025. While we expect the market to grow slower than historical rates for the full year, we expect improvement throughout the year with the second half of the year returning to more traditional levels of growth. We expect our results to mirror that cadence of improvement on a core basis. As Padraig noted earlier, we exited Q4 with a book-to-bill ratio over one for the company, and greater than one for instruments. In addition, Q4 was the first quarter in 2024 that instrument orders grew year on year. While one quarter does not a trend make, it is certainly encouraging. For the full year guide, we expect revenue in the range of $6.79 to $6.87 billion. This represents a reported growth range of 4.3% to 5.5%. Currency is a slight headwind of 0.2 points while M&A related to BioVectra contributes 2% at the low end and 2.2% at the high end. This translates to a core growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. To start the year, we think this is a prudent way to plan given the near-term dynamics in the US. From a geographic perspective, we expect modest growth in the Americas and Europe. While we see funnel activity increasing in China, we are taking a conservative approach on the timing of revenue associated with the stimulus. We expect to see recovery over the course of the year in China, resulting in slightly positive growth for the full year. From a business group perspective, we expect to return to growth in all three groups led by ACG. As a note, this statement is true under the new structure as well. As Parmeet mentioned earlier, we will provide recast historical segment information to reflect these changes ahead of our upcoming investor day. In terms of phasing, we expect improvement throughout the year with more normalized growth expected in the second half of the year. We are projecting roughly fifty to seventy basis points of operating margin expansion for the year. Below the line, we expect net interest expense of $25 million due to the financing of BioVectra versus the net interest income this year. In addition, we expect a tax rate of 13% and 286 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.54 to $5.61 and incorporates the planned five cents year one dilution from BioVectra. This range represents a 5% to 6% growth rate if excluding the BioVectra dilution, a growth rate of 6% to 7% year on year. We expect cash flow to remain strong in fiscal year 2025. We are expecting roughly $1.65 billion in operating cash flow and $450 million in CapEx as 2025 is the peak spending year for the NASD expansion. Looking to Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion. Our forecast assumes no significant budget flush during the end of this calendar year. This represents a reported decline of 0.5% to growth of 1.3%. Currency is a thirty basis point headwind while M&A is expected to contribute 1.8 points of growth. We are expecting core growth between a decline of 2% to flat at the upper end. It's important to note that we estimate our projected Q1 year-over-year results will be negatively impacted this year by roughly two percentage points due to timing of the Lunar New Year which occurs in late January, versus February of last year. This includes the additional $15 million in revenue pull forward we communicated in Q1 of last year. Adjusting for the Lunar New Year impact, we are expecting continued sequential growth improvement. First quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28. Lower than the full year growth rate due to the Lunar New Year timing. Looking into 2025 and beyond, we remain incredibly optimistic about the future of our markets and our long-term prospects. We are confident in our new market-focused approach and the Ignite transformation will propel us to accelerated growth and we will become a stronger company. With that, I'll turn it back over to Padraig for some closing comments.\nPadraig McDonnell: I've said it before and I want to say it again. These are exciting times at Agilent. Over the last several months, we've been focused on evolving our strategy, transforming our processes, and empowering our people while continuing to win in the marketplace. Already we've made bold moves that have created momentum. We've developed our future strategy, we've kicked off our Ignite transformation to help execute on that strategy. And along the way, we've made moves to create new growth vectors. We are making acquisitions that will contribute to our growth and we are strengthening our capability to efficiently and effectively integrate those acquisitions that will lay the foundation for future M&A. These initial actions position us well for the journey ahead.\nBob McMahon: They ensure we are building the capability\nPadraig McDonnell: strength, and speed to reinvigorate our culture and enable us to thrive while delivering outstanding results for our customers and for our shareholders. And amid all this change, Fortune magazine this month named Agilent number eleven among the world's best workplaces 2024, a list that only includes twenty-five companies. This is yet another recognition of what we already know internally. The Agilent team is the best in the industry. This is not only a recognition of our outstanding company culture, of the talented professionals we have.\nBob McMahon: Ones who are ambitious,\nPadraig McDonnell: resilient, and high performing. This is exactly the team we need to evolve Agilent. To build an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers, and creates value for our shareholders. Thank you again for joining today's call. I couldn't be more energized by the momentum we have, the opportunities we will seize, and the history we will make. Now I look forward to answering your questions. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Padraig. Operator, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.\nOperator: And your first question today comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Padraig, maybe one for you. Just on the instrument side, and I know you guys touched on the book-to-bill over one for three quarters now, a little bit of improved growth on the order side year over year. Can you talk about where we are in the cycle, what your expectations are? As you guys know, there's a debate in the market about what the cycle looks like. Does it overcorrect to the upside as we work our way through the next year or so? Are you guys framing that up? What's the right way to think about this replacement cycle, where we are, and the size of it as we go forward here?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Great question. So, you know, clearly, we're seeing a steady recovery in instruments and, you know, our book-to-bill was greater than one, which is really great to see. In terms of replacement cycle, what you would see across the industry is that it's not uniform. It's across different vendors at different speeds and, of course, at different times. But what we do see is that we have we're probably midway through the expected timing on where we expect that replacement cycle to be. We see competitors are probably benefiting from refresh of their own install base with some new systems. But what you would see from our side is our Infinity 3 that we announced last month. We expect to start seeing an increased demand for our solutions, and we're seeing a lot of excitement with our customer base. And we've already seen tens of millions of dollars in orders there. So what we expect in that replacement cycle is to be slow and steady, but really kicking off in Q1.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. And that's helpful. And then maybe on China, you know, always a focus with you guys. It sounds like slight growth for 2025 is the right way to think about it. Can you just talk about what you guys are seeing there and hearing there? You know, Bob, helpful to hear that you guys got your first orders there in October. What's the expectation as we move forward here? It sounds like a steady recovery. Are you still seeing I know you guys were kinda hovering around that $300 million revenue a quarter stability. It sounds like continued and maybe a little bit of improvements as we work our way through the year. Are there different segments that are maybe picking up a little bit? Would be helpful to talk through. Thank you, guys.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. So performance was a bit better than expected, and it was also really encouraging to see lab activity to continue to improve across our services and consumables. So we actually have seen quite dramatic share gains within China, which is also a really good point. So what I would say is it's steadily improving. You know, talking to the teams. And I would say on the stimulus side, you know, we talked in the call about we've already have some stimulus orders in. We expect much more in Q1. That will, of course, translate to revenue. And this is a really, really good sign as we see momentum both from the direct input of more confidence in the market and, of course, getting the dollars in. So steadily improving, and we expect that through the year, Patrick. We expect as we go through the stimulus orders and we go forward, expect that to improve. One area that was really standout for us was PFAS in China. It was the fastest-growing business for us across the globe or region across the globe, and that just goes to show the durable nature of some of these growth factors that are happening where you have the emergent pollutants act moving. And what we've seen in China is that our great technical expertise coupled with our great solutions are already there to pick up the business. So that was one real clear standout.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Patrick. Just want to add on to what Padraig is saying. Yeah. You're absolutely right. We ended the quarter with roughly $310 million, $312 to be precise, in China. Which was a nice sequential increase from Q3 and, you know, it was down 3% as I mentioned. In addition to the PFAS, both chemical and advanced materials actually grew in the quarter. We're, you know, we have a leadership position and pharma was flat, which was actually a very nice thing. And we're taking a kind of a conservative approach, as I mentioned, in terms of the stimulus orders, but we've seen quite active funnel from the standpoint of bidding activity here in the first half of this quarter as well as and expect that to continue throughout the course of 2025.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Bob and Padraig. I appreciate it.\nPadraig McDonnell: Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first one just on DGG, which has been sort of weighing on growth over the course of the year, but noticeably strong quarter. You had called out CancerDx as well as genomics. Could you just provide a little bit more color on what's driving that growth? And how sustainable do you think that growth is, particularly in genomics as we move through 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. I just said start off, and I'll kick it over to Simon. You know, as we really are seeing nice growth in our pathology business, which grew high single digits in Q4 and is slightly ahead of expectations. A highly durable business in any markets. What we're seeing in genomics, while it's a still challenging market, we posted low single-digit growth, which was also ahead of expectations. But, Simon, I don't know if you want to add some color.\nSimon May: Yeah. Just a quick couple of quick points to add. As Padraig mentioned, we were pretty pleased with the high single-digit growth that we saw in pathology in the quarter. And in particular, the blend and the mix between instruments and consumables there, we continue to be really healthy. With our instrument placements, and we think that sees us quite nicely going into 2025. On the genomic side, it was really notable because it's the first time that we've seen growth in genomics for quite a while now. I'd say we've had a bit of a pivot in our strategy there to really double down on the growth drivers that we see in genomics, where we've got clearly differentiated value propositions and in particular, our Magnus automated NGS library prep continues to see fantastic traction. We're also very encouraged by the pipeline that we're seeing for our Aveda NGS chemistry. And, again, this gives us a lot of hope going into FY 2025. And as I think about pathology and genomics and these growth factors that we see here, we do believe that they're durable given the macro conditions and the competitive position that we enjoy.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thanks. And maybe just for my follow-up, a high-level question for you, Padraig. On the resegmentation, it makes sense from a go-to-market strategy for some of these segments to put them together. I'm wondering from an R&D development and new product innovation, how this might help. I mean, you referenced the LC replacement cycle accelerating faster for competitors as they refresh their installed base. Should we start to see a faster cycle of new product introductions due to the resegmentation, or is it gonna be similar to the pace that we've seen in the past and resegmentation really doesn't necessarily inform R&D direction?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Well, look, I think we're refocusing the groups really for a few reasons. We want to be closer to customers, but also understanding where do we want to make our biggest investment or most asymmetric that are going to accelerate innovation in key areas. And when I talk about focus, it's really three things. You know, it's the energy to time, but also the capital allocation. And what you will see from this refocusing of our segments, we're gonna be able to do that. You're gonna see programs accelerate. But also, we don't want to be two inches deep across the company. We want to be focused on our key growth factors and making sure we accelerate. We have a huge amount of product lines and, of course, we can have incremental additions to product lines across the board. But from this new structure, you're gonna see an acceleration of R&D. No doubt about it.\nMatt Sykes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rachael Raycroft with Your line is open.\nRachael Raycroft: Perfect. Thank you for taking the questions, you guys, and good afternoon. So I wanted to follow-up on Patrick's question on China. Appreciate that it's early days, but how are you guys thinking about the risk of potential tariffs on Agilent's business at this point in China and in the rest of the world? Is there anything embedded in guidance currently from a tariff standpoint? And then can you remind us what was the tariff impact on Agilent in the first Trump administration?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Rachael. This is Bob. I'll take that question. As you can imagine, there's been a fair amount of work that we've been doing on this exact question. What I would take it if I took it into two chunks, actually, we've been working on diversifying our supply chain particularly within China, you know, China, back in eighteen, nineteen when the first tariffs came and then, obviously, double down on that resiliency with COVID. And so it is ten to fifteen million dollars existing today. And we think that the future potential magnitude of this is certainly manageable with us with additional mitigation activities. Obviously, with something that would be more broad-based than that, it would be more material. But to just give you a frame of reference, roughly two-thirds of our business in the US comes from product that's sourced in the US.\nRachael Raycroft: Great. That's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, you mentioned that chemical and advanced materials grew 1% this quarter. Was wondering, could you just break down some of the trends that you saw within? You mentioned that semiconductors drove some of the performance that you saw on the advanced materials side. We actually had one of your peers call out some weakness in semi this quarter. So just talk to us about what you're seeing from an underlying perspective on that side. And then again, just tell me business as well. Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. So in the chemical advance materials, we grew 1% and we sold 4% of materials, and that's driven, you know, a lot by our battery business that we have and, of course, semiconductor. We saw a slight decline in chemical and energy. But overall, we're very happy with the growth that we've seen in Asia ex-China, by the way, was driven and also low single digits in China. So the one thing that I would note about this industry is that we've got the broadest platform and solutions around it. And it's the CAM is returning to positive year on year growth for the first time since Q2 in 2023, so that really bodes well for the future.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Rachael. And maybe just for the benefit of you and the rest of the folks on the call, I talked about guidance. If you look at it by end market, just to kinda give everyone a frame, you know, for the full year FY 2025, we're expecting pharma to return to growth. So low to mid-single-digit growth there. Academia government roughly flat. Actually, expect the diagnosis and clinical that Simon just talked about to continue and be the highest growth end market, at least to start off the year here in FY 2025 at mid-single digits. CAM also low to mid, given the work and the discussion that Padraig just gave. And then food and environmental, both low single digits with pockets of very strong growth. And really, you know, food, there was a potential where the actually could accelerate throughout the course of the year given some of the potential changes in the administration coming up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe building off of the last question here on the drivers of fiscal 2025. When you look at the first half versus second half, it does assume a back half step up. We're just curious. Is that being driven by end markets normalizing? Maybe if you could just walk us through from first half versus back half dynamics in fiscal 2025?\nBob McMahon: Yeah, Vijay. That's exactly right. So, you know, obviously, our first quarter is what I would call artificially depressed just because of the way of the nature of our timing of our fiscal year relative to Lunar New Year. But if you looked at first half versus second half, we're expecting this continued recovery throughout the course of the year. And with a more normalized growth in the back half of the year. And so where does that show up? It shows up in a couple of areas. Obviously, with the potential for China getting better throughout the course of the year. As Padraig mentioned, certainly, stimulus can help that. We've taken a conservative approach on that and not fully baked in with all the activity that we talked about. We'll see how that plays out, but certainly early days are very positive from that standpoint. And then also from a pharma perspective, we're also expecting to see that recovery particularly on the back of Infinity 3 as Padraig just mentioned, and that replacement cycle accelerating. So you're actually seeing those that would be the two biggest and then, you know, continued biotech recovery on the small biotech side as well throughout the course of next year.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then one on that maybe margins, we cash. Pretty impressive free cash execution in fiscal 2024. Just wanna make sure I have the numbers right. Is the guide assuming free cash flow down above it, there's a timing element and on the margin sort of similar cadence question, what is Q1 assuming and what drives the back half step up in margins? Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. So Q1, so let me answer your question around free cash flow. Yeah. We are expecting a slight slip down really a result of a step up in CapEx spending this year versus last year. As we, you know, finished the heavy levels of spending for the NASD expansion for Trane CND. I don't expect that to continue into 2026 and 2027, so you would see that then step back down. So that free cash flow is really a timing issue. In terms of Q1, profitability with the lower revenue, we typically have higher expenses in Q1 as some of the merit resets. We've got our sales meetings and kickoffs meetings there, and then you've got, you know, some January typically is a very light month, but we have a full amount of expenses in there. And then you then also look at the Ignite transformation that Padraig talked about, many of those activities that we've been kicking off will come into play in the second half of the year, which will generate incremental savings both on the top line and the bottom line. And what you'll hear more about that, some of those details at the Investor Day in mid-December.\nVijay Kumar: And so thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just walk us through for the 2025 guide what this assumes for each of the segments. Not sure if you can provide it under the old method or just the new method, but any color would be great.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. I could do that. So if you think about this at, I'll call it legacy number. So LSAG kinda low single digits with the consumables business being kind of mid-single-digit and slower on the instrument throughout the course of the year. That's probably our area where we've taken a prudent approach as we go through the course of the year. It could be more than that, depending on the uptake of the replacement cycle INFINITY 3, but low single digits there. ACG continued to be very strong with mid to high single digits as the instrumentation recovery and then continued double-digit on the services business. Just continues to be a real stalwart of growth, and we still have a lot of opportunity there around rate. And then for DGG, kind of low to mid-single-digit growth. Going forward, which is a recovery, you know, the continued performance of pathology in the genomics businesses, as Simon mentioned, and then a return to growth really for NESD.\nJack Meehan: Right. Okay. And then wondering if you could just talk a little bit more just what your expectations are for LC, LCMS. I think everybody's trying to benchmark expectations for next year and one of your peers sounds a little bit more bullish as it pertains to the cycle. So I don't know if you have any thoughts as we try and compare and contrast some of these results. Any color would be great. And maybe just off of that, any comments you can share around GLP one contribution I think that might be a factor, but any color would be great. Thank you.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. So, you know, there's a lot of dynamism in terms of replacement cycle. You know, it doesn't happen at any time, as I said before, any one time, but it's across the board in different industries and different times. From our perspective, you know, our LC and LCMS orders are improving. There's no doubt about that. And we have a huge amount of excitement around our Infinity 3. We have a lot of focus programs with our customers around that. So what you will see next year is I think it's a steady increase in cadence of that replacement cycle. You know, it's a little bit too early to call. Will that be gradual over a number of quarters or a bolus in one quarter or maybe then a slowdown and again on the next quarter? But we're really watching that as we go forward. I think we're being very conservative around what we're seeing on that because of a lot of turbulences everybody has seen in the last few years in the market. But I would say customer sentiment is steadily improving. And on the GLP One side, you know, we had a really fantastic year. We grew 30% in GLP one this year. We're involved in a lot of new site build-outs in QAQC departments and actual getting closer to production as well with systems. So a very, very strong year. And actually one thing that's really interesting is through the acquisition of BioVectra, we, of course, have a healthy pipeline of GLP-one and synthetic peptides within their CDMO capability. We're seeing a lot of requests from both sides of the business about how we can help customers both on the analytical side and on the CDMO side. So we're seeing a huge amount of synergies there. So this is a market that's going to continue very strongly and we're going to be really there to take the business.\nBob McMahon: Hey, Jack. Just to build on what Padraig is saying on the LC replacement cycle, I think one of the things is, you know, we're taking a more conservative approach as Padraig mentioned. And I think if that happens, we will get that business rest assured. I would also say, if we look at the age of our installed base, it is continuing to get old. It is well beyond the median now. And throughout the course of next year. So we would expect that to continue to be able to be replaced. Because when we look at the instrumentation through our consumables business and our services business, the activity continues to be high. So these instruments are being used, and so it's only a matter of time to be able to do that replacement.\nJack Meehan: Awesome. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from UBS. Hi. Thank you. Just to clarify on instruments one last time, is your expectation that instrument growth is flat in 2025?\nBob McMahon: In aggregate across all platforms, our expectation is that it will grow. Low single digits.\nDan Leonard: Okay. And then my follow-up. You mentioned, I think, something about the administration and changes in your food forecast. Are there any other areas where you think the change in US administration could impact your business? Any other areas that you were sensitive to putting together your forecast for 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Look, there's a lot of changes that can happen at this time. You know, there's a lot of people expecting a lot of change. We have yet to see what those changes will be. Of course, you can see maybe some changes in the NIH funding, which is very low for us as a percentage of the business. We actually expect the PFAS spending will actually increase as it goes forward on it. The area to watch, I would say, is, of course, tariffs, which Bob talked about. We're ready for that. Ready for any scenario on that side. But also on biopharma, I think, is the IRA is also continues to move forward, the International Pricing Index seeing what happens on biopharma is gonna be really important. So that's why we're taking a kind of conservative and prudent approach. So lots going on. But what I would say is from the strategy work, I would imagine, we're ready for all outcomes.\nDan Leonard: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yeah. Hi, Padraig, Bob, thanks for taking my questions. First one, just wanted to clarify on the tariff side. I mean, if there were any retaliatory tariffs could you elaborate on your manufacturing and final assembly positions just globally so we can understand sort of how much of the product is sort of China for China, made in China versus made in other Asian countries and not coming from the US.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Maybe I can start off by talking about our, you know, our US supply chain in there. About 60%, as Bob said, is produced in the United States. About 35% is the rest of the world. So it's actually a small percentage that's produced in China. But, of course, we have mitigations and steps there. We have many supply chain areas across the globe that we can move around, and we've done that before since 2018. We expect the impact probably in the quarter of $4 million to $5 million we can probably mitigate that within a few months. So I would say we're waiting to see how that all plays out. But we're already taking steps across potential tariffs. The big question for everybody is that will it be on will it be beyond China? I think everybody's waiting to see what that is, but even in that case, we're ready with mitigations.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Puneet. To build on what Padraig is saying, particularly for retaliatory tariffs in China, very little of our revenue now is produced in the US that goes into China. We spent a lot of time and effort building in China for China, and we have a full portfolio of capabilities there. Which is actually really important for us to be able to take full advantage of the stimulus products today. So, and, you know, I think that number will be relatively small. From the standpoint of retaliatory impact from China exports from the US.\nPuneet Souda: That's helpful. Thanks. And then, I have a question on Infinity 3 series. Just wondering, given the launch timing, was there any pause that you saw in on the instrumentation? And what is the order book telling you? Do you think this is what's driving, you know, is it a major driver of instrumentation orders in the quarter being positive as you pointed out?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. You know, we had a minimal effect to be honest. We really planned around that and of course, we are very careful with our customers to make sure we bring them through the cycle of replacement. So minimal impact. You know, we're very extremely excited about it. You know, it's a system that not only will be best in class in terms of performance, but also in terms of productivity. And that's what we're hearing loud and clear from our customers. It's about productivity and how it lends their labs to be more productive going forward. We're extremely pleased with the order book that we've seen so far. And we expect that that will continue to ramp and, you know, customers are really voting with their orders on that. So we're excited about that ramp for next year.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Thank you. Look forward to the investor day.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Wanted to probe in a little bit. Are you able to delineate what LC did and what mass spec did in the quarter? And then just thinking a little bit about the new administration, I know you're not guiding for any budget flush here, but is there any risk of kind of pause in spending given all the moving pieces around pharma? What are you hearing from customers at this point?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Maybe I can start with the second part, Tycho. We're not seeing a pause from pharma validating. We're actually seeing a little bit more activity. So we're not seeing that across the board, and that's about the US and globally. And, of course, that's something we really want to watch with the new administration coming in. And what transpires over the next few weeks. But in terms of the LC and LCMS, Bob, I don't know if you got any color on those.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Tycho. Just to give you a couple of different pieces of data. If I look at our pharma business overall, it was down low single digits. Pharma, small molecule was actually up 3% overall with biotech or biopharma being down. If we look at specifically LC, LCMS, within pharma, it was up low single digits.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up on NASD, I know I think you're talking back to growth in 2025. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about your ability to cross-sell with BioVectra and then how are you thinking about clinical versus commercial customers?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. I'll start off, Tycho, and I'll hand it over to Simon. You know, first of all, we are extremely pleased on the cross-selling ability between the two businesses. It was one of the key sources of value about why we did the BioVectra acquisition that customers were asking us for this capability, a broader range of capability, and we've seen that actually accelerate from both sides. Simon, I don't know if you want to add more color on NESD.\nSimon May: Yeah. Just to build on what Padraig said with BioVectra and the NASD cross-pollination, there's been really strong engagement between the teams. In fact, they spent several days together in our Boulder facility last week, and I'd say they came away really energized that the portfolio complementarity fit between businesses is exactly as we expected. In fact, maybe a little bit more so. Then as we think about NASD going into FY 2025, I think as Bob mentioned earlier, we're projecting high single-digit growth for the business. The order book looks really strong in NASD, but it's important to understand the nuances of the mix in that order book. We've got a number of commercialization qualifications going on right now. So in terms of FY 2025 revenue, there's a lot of energy going into that with relatively limited revenue upside, and a lot of that's gonna actually hit towards FY 2026. But, again, the order book overall is very healthy. And as we think about twelve, eighteen, twenty-four months view, we're really bullish about what we're seeing. But once again, high single-digit growth, maybe we'll nudge double-digit in NASD in FY 2025?\nTycho Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBrandon Couillard: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just on the Infinity 3 launch, can you remind us, you know, when the Infinity 2 I think it's the 1290 system rolled out. And what's the is there an ASP premium? Is there an ASP kicker to this replacement cycle this time as well to the three versus the legacy two system. Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. We don't talk about a difference in pricing on it, you know, but I think we've had a number of years, of course, very, very successful years with the Infinity 2 and this builds on success. I will say that the installed base for Agilent is way broader than the Infinity 2. You know, we have 1100s that are very, very prominent out there. We have a lot of labs with 1100s and those are the labs for us, I think, that are gonna be talking about replacement. But we also have seen significant interest from Infinity 2 customers because the CDXTR productivity capability is really going to help them in the lab. So I would say it's not just, you know, one series to the next. It's a broad install base replenishment we're gonna see.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. All I would say is pricing has held up very nicely. Early days.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. And then Bob, how much of the CapEx is in Nexter is tied to the train B and build out for NASD, we expect those to come online, and what does maintenance CapEx look like? In fiscal 2026? Thanks.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. That's a great question. So roughly half is NASD between the continued build-out and the validation activities of that $450 million. If I look at, kinda maintenance CapEx, think about it in, you know, kinda two and a half to three times sales. Range on a go-forward basis.\nBrandon Couillard: That's total cover. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDoug Schenkel: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to start first with a question on guidance philosophy. Just to be clear, it sounds like you're trying to factor in a degree of conservatism on China stimulus, the impact of uncertainty as it relates to the new administration, and conservatism on a potential LC replacement cycle. Hopefully, I'm not missing anything there. But is it fair to say that the error bar around your assumptions are wider than normal heading into a new fiscal year and your intent across the board was to make assumptions that were consistently on the lower end of those error bars?\nPadraig McDonnell: I think you said it well. You know, we were very conservative in that because of those reasons, you know, what is the expected LC replacement cycle recovery? Is it faster? Is it, you know, is it a little bit less than that? The China stimulus, you know, which is very early days, you know, I think we want to make sure that we continue to monitor that. And, of course, whether we see improved conditions or not in terms of sentiment in the US. So all of these things are factoring into this. So it is conservative in what we're guiding, but also I'd say here, the bars are wider than normal.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. Thank you for that. And just as always, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe in your prepared remarks, you indicated that small molecule was up low single digits while biopharma was down mid-singles. If I have that right, is that comp effect, or are you seeing more of a recovery in demand amongst, you know, small versus large molecule applications, and I guess, finally, if so, why? That seems to be a little contradicting just curious if you could give us a little more there.\nBob McMahon: Yeah, Doug. You know, you heard it right. Our small molecule business was up low single digits across both instruments. You know, it was the combination of instruments and services. And our biotech, our large molecule was down mid-singles. Now if you took out NASD, which shows up in the large molecule, it was down low single digits. So better recovery than the mid-single digits. And it actually speaks to, I think, that continuation of volume in small molecule. You know, if you look at pill count, it continues to go up. And these are, you know, well-capitalized companies. They have probably the older fleet you just think about kind of the replacement versus kind of the biotechs of the world, and so we're expecting that to continue and, it was the first to kind of go down. And so we're, you know, in the cycle, and I think we're expecting it to be the first, you know, moving positive. Now we think there's more upside in biotech than there is in small molecule, but it certainly is a nice leading indicator around the idea around this replacement cycle.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Line is open.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to ask a quick follow-up on China stimulus. I know you kinda touched on them in a couple of different questions. But early in the prepared remarks, you did make some comments of, you know, seeing some initial China stimulus orders come in. I think China in the quarter exceeded your expectations. I know there's not a lot embedded directly into the guide. But could you just walk us through sort of, like, how China's stimulus could play out next year? And I'm asking this from a perspective of, you know, gradual ramp as you go through the year. Is it gonna be a trickle? Is it could it be very back-end loaded? It's just trying to think through the various scenarios and what you're looking for there. Once the initial order is clear.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Look. I think what we've seen is that it's much broader. The stimulus in terms of range. We spoke about that before. We see it, you know, both on commercial and government accounts. Our first orders have actually come in from government accounts. We've been highly successful in those overall tenders, and we're in the low millions range, low single-digit millions range of orders to bring. We're expecting to close much more this quarter. And one thing that's really playing into our favor is our broad platform capabilities. Including the technical capabilities of our teams up and running. And you couple that with our Made in China initiatives that we really invested over the last year, it puts us in a very, very strong position to capitalize, but it'll be interesting to see how that's launched. Past the first quarter, we don't have great visibility yet, but, of course, a lot of deal activity. But the first quarter is looking very strong in terms of orders.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Mike. And just to kind of frame it, kind of how we're thinking about China to your point. If we took Q4 and just divide it by or multiply it by four, that would get you to that low single-digit growth. Now we're expecting a recovery throughout the course of the year, but that kind of gives you a sense for what we put in the initial guide and we'll know a lot more about those timing of the stimulus revenues going forward. You know, once we actually get those awarded and then the delivery dates and so forth. But we do think that that'll occur throughout the course of the year.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Bob, maybe for you, just on the margin guide for next year, fifty to seventy bps. So really impressive starting point honestly better than I think a lot expected. Especially given, you know, still a little bit of a subdued top-line environment. How much of that can you attribute to Ignite and sort of, you know, maybe some of the transformation or one-time cost savings, how much is just the underlying strength of the business, maybe beside the price or some mix shift next year? Just a little bit of what's going into that margin expansion for next year?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. What I would say, Mike, is it's a little of all those things. So maybe stay tuned, and we'll give you a little more meat on the bones here come mid-December. But we certainly have some incremental opportunities both in price and, you know, cost efficiencies associated with the Ignite transformation. And those things will start to feather into the second half of this year, as I mentioned before. If you recall, the first half of this year also has the annualization of the savings of the actions that we had to take in the June, July time frame as well. So we're benefiting and then you also have the merit increases and so forth that gets reset. And so you'll actually see this throughout the course of the year through a series of initiatives that have already been kicked off.\nPadraig McDonnell: And I would say just following up on that, Bob, we're very excited to meet everybody in December in New York to talk about it. It's an extremely well-thought-out program. It's across the board. It's ultimately gonna help us to invest for growth in key areas as well as margin expansion.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions here. Maybe the first one just on pharma. In the Americas. I think you called that in the prepared remarks Americas Pharma XMASD was kind of maybe a weaker spot. You just unpack a little bit what's happening in, you know, US versus, say, Europe, rest of the world and kind of, you know, what's kind of assumed from what happened in 4Q in 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. I mean, look, we saw a lot of strength in Europe in terms of pharma. I wouldn't read too much into the American numbers. You know, I think there is, of course, companies wondering about their CapEx budgets and that comes at different phases. But we expect, we expect Pharma to continue.\nDan Brennan: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on if I can just go into the broader market. I know you talked about the period in Mark's, Bob, and a few times it came up like you're expecting a below-trend market. At least it sounds like for the first half of the year, can you just remind us in terms of your kind of growth algorithm maybe, like, what would what is your assumptions based upon for a market growth typically? Kinda what are you assuming? And kind of specifically, is it just pharma that's weaker? Or are there other spots that you're pointing to that are below trend? And, you know, any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Yeah, Dan, if we looked at the long-term growth rates of our markets, we believe those are mid-single digits, you know, four to when you look at the aggregate across. We're obviously not expecting that for the full year here. We are expecting that we're doing better than the market. If you look at kinda how we exited here roughly flat on a core basis, you know, if you adjust for the timing of Lunar New Year, you know, you had the midpoint one percent, you know, and expect that kind of performance to continue that cadence. And so you would have the second half of the year a more normalized kind of growth rates. And so it's really across the board. We're seeing, you know, some of the industrial or applied markets things like CAM being a little ahead of the curve and certainly our diagnostics and clinical business continues to be strong. It has been throughout the course of this year. Exiting at a very healthy rate, and I would expect that to continue. The big ones are pharma coming in and then, you know, some of the other applied markets as well.\nOperator: And this concludes the question and answer session. Mr. Ahuja, I turn the call back over to you.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Rob, and thanks everyone for joining the call today. Before we sign off, I'd like to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving. Have a good rest of the day and week everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to withdraw your question, again, press star one. Thank you. Parmeet Ahuja, you may begin your conference.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, and welcome everyone to Agilent's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. I am sure you have seen our press release earlier today regarding our new market-focused organizational structure, which we will talk about in more detail. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. All financial metrics and guidance during this call will be shared under our historical structure. We will provide recast historical segment information to reflect these changes ahead of our upcoming investor day. Now onto our quarterly results. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO, and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Phil Binns, President of the former Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group, Simon May, President of the newly formed Life Sciences and Diagnostic Markets Group, and Angelica Riemann, President of the expanded Agilent CrossLab Group. Also joining the call is Mike Zhang, President of the newly formed Applied Markets Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our fourth quarter financial results, investor presentation, and information to supplement today's discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are available on our website at investors.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year, and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past twelve months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risk and other factors. And now I would like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Great. Thank you, Parmeet. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Before I begin, I would like to welcome new AMG President, Mike Zhang. While Mike is new to this role, he is not new to Agilent. Mike joined Agilent more than twenty years ago as a manufacturing engineer in China and most recently was Vice President and General Manager of the GC and GCMS business. Within our former Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group, with his broad experience in both manufacturing and into the business, Mike will be an incredible asset in this role. Very much looking forward to him moving AMG and Agilent forward. I also want to take a moment to wish Phil Binns a wonderful retirement in advance of him leaving Agilent. Phil joined Agilent with the Varian acquisition in 2010. All told, Phil is celebrating just over forty years of service with Agilent and Varian. Although Phil is retiring from the business president role, he has graciously agreed to serve as a special adviser through April 2025. All of us at Agilent wish Phil the very best and look forward to working with him during the last five months at Agilent. Now onto our high-level Q4 results. I am happy to share not only our solid fourth quarter results that point to continued steady market recovery, but also our outlook and drivers for the 2025 fiscal year. I am especially excited to talk about Agilent's customer-first strategy evolution and our aggressive transformation ambition that led to the news you read ahead of the call. The new market-focused organizational structure to become a nimbler, even more customer-centric company to accelerate our performance. In the fourth quarter, the Agilent team delivered revenue of $1.701 billion, roughly one percent reported growth with a flat core growth. This represents a sequential improvement of over four hundred basis points from Q3. In addition, our total company book-to-bill was greater than one. This points to a steady market improvement we are seeing and we expect it to continue in 2025. We also gained share in all our geographies. Evidence that even in challenging CapEx environment, customers trust Agilent. As we evolve, we are confident this will only accelerate. Bob will provide deeper details on our Q4 results and our outlook for Q1 and FY 2025. Now I would like to spend some time talking about our new organization structure we announced earlier today. Our new market-focused organization structure is a result of our customer-centric market force strategy and an important step in our organizational transformation work, which we have named Ignite. This is a product of our enterprise focus strategy that drives our evolution to become a nimbler, even more customer-centric company to accelerate our performance. The new market-focused organization structure is one of the most significant changes Agilent has seen in a decade and continues the work we did creating our commercial organization three years ago. The commercial organization doubled down on our customer-first approach in the field and it's a critical competitive advantage in supporting our customers. At that time, we started by creating a singular commercial leadership structure. We then created a foundational infrastructure and intensified our focus on digital capabilities, accelerated and end-to-end customer experience, and ensured sales channels were customer and market-centric. So changes you see today are part of the successful journey we started three years ago. With the new structure, we are aligning business units to our markets facilitating close collaboration among the businesses like never before and enabling better execution and cross-division customer-first priorities. We are combining the strength of our three businesses as well as our portfolios so that we can offer end-to-end solutions and workflows revolve around our customers and markets. The Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group's or LDG represents $2.5 billion in annual revenue and is primarily focused on our pharma, biopharma, and clinical diagnostic end markets. LDG provides a comprehensive portfolio of leading technology platforms and solutions to serve Agilent's customers' value chain, including research and discovery, development and scale-up, production of therapeutics, and development of critical cancer diagnostics. LDG includes LC and LCMS, cell analysis as well as CDMO capabilities which include NESD and BioVectra. The business also includes pathology, companion diagnostics, and genomics. Simon May will serve as president of LDG prior to joining Agilent earlier this year at Bio-Rad Laboratories. Simon was Executive Vice President and President of Life Science Group. The Applied Markets Group or AMG represents $1.3 billion in annual revenue and is focused on food, environmental, forensics, chemicals, and advanced materials markets. AMG includes GC and GCMS spectroscopy, vacuum technology platforms, and certified pre-owned business. AMG will focus on growing its agile and strong leadership in these markets and accelerating growth in new areas of the market. Mike Zhang, a twenty-two-year veteran of Agilent, has been promoted to president of AMG. Most recently, Mike was Vice President and General Manager of our GC and GCMS product lines. The Agilent CrossLab Group or ACG represents $2.7 billion in annual revenue and is focused on supporting our customers in all our end markets. The group is uniquely positioned to leverage its comprehensive portfolio and capabilities to further enhance the installed base of instruments with targeted workflows and applications that drive critical outcomes and productivity in labs. ACG includes services, software and informatics, automation, and consumables. This business will accelerate and strengthen customer relationships across all end markets. Angelica Riemann, a twenty-five-year veteran of Agilent, will continue to serve as president of ACG. Prior to her current role, she served as Vice President and General Manager of the ACG services business. This change is one of the many that demonstrate how we are becoming nimbler and accelerating the pace of innovation. And you can see that with the Q4 launch of the exciting Agilent Infinity 3 LC series that harnesses our fifty years of LC expertise and leadership. The Infinity 3 series has advanced automation that simplifies our customers' daily routines and is compatible with previous generation, which allows for seamless upgrades and technology refreshes. And Agilent Infinity Lab LC solutions are certified by MyGreenLab. These instruments optimize lab space, and they reduce water, solvent, and energy consumption while also minimizing waste. While just launched in October, early traction from customers has been very positive. Also in Q4, we closed our acquisition of BioVectra, demonstrating our commitment to providing customers the most advanced capabilities to accelerate our therapeutic programs. With BioVectra now being part of Agilent, we expand our portfolio of CDMO services beyond our market-leading oligonucleotide production at NASD. Adding more rapidly growing therapeutic modalities like peptide synthesis, a market expected to continue to expand rapidly over the coming years. And bringing world-class capability to support gene editing therapies. Just last month, my leadership team and I visited BioVectra to welcome our new team members to Agilent, and we became even more accelerated by the capabilities we would be able to harness. Plus both Agilent and BioVectra's focus on putting customer first and accelerating the pace of innovation so we can add to and capitalize on opportunities was abundantly clear as I spoke to dozens of BioVectra employees. Separately, during the quarter, we hit another important milestone. For the full year, we passed the $1 billion mark in digital orders, for the first time across the company. This is a result of our investment in our digital ecosystem to ensure our customers can do business with us in ways that meet their needs. To reinforce what I have stated in previous calls, we are sharply focused on key growth factors such as BioPharma, PFAS, and advanced materials. And the Agilent team has mobilized to accelerate value creation through our Ignite transformation program. The objective of Ignite is to drive revenue growth and margin expansion by increasing our execution capabilities.\nOperator: The world is moving faster than ever,\nPadraig McDonnell: and so are we. That is exactly why we introduced our new market-focused organization structure. We are laser-focused on winning in the marketplace and adding value to our customers and shareholders. We will dive more deeply into these details including our evolved strategy and the Ignite transformation, that will help us execute on that strategy. At our investor day on December seventeenth in New York.\nBob McMahon: We\nPadraig McDonnell: Bob would now provide the details of the results as well as our outlook for the fiscal year of 2025 and the first quarter. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Thank you, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on fourth quarter revenue and take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I will then cover our guidance for fiscal year 2025 and the first quarter of 2025. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Padraig said, we are pleased with our Q4 results. Agilent finished the fourth quarter, with core growth in line with our expectations while EPS exceeded our expectations as we executed well against a challenging albeit improving market. Q4 revenue was $1.701 billion, a decline of 0.3% core but a sequential improvement of over four hundred basis points. On a reported basis, our revenues were up 0.8% as we benefited from fifty basis points of currency and BioVectra contributed sixty basis points. Looking at our Q4 performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $833 million in revenue. That represents a 1% decline as instrument volumes continue to be constrained, by conservative customer CapEx spending while consumables grew mid-single digits. Having said that, for our instruments business, our orders grew year on year and for the third consecutive quarter, our book-to-bill was once again greater than one. We see this as positive evidence of an ongoing steady instrument recovery. Moving on to Agilent CrossLab Group, the business delivered revenue of $426 million for the quarter, 5%. ACG grew in every market and in every region except China, where it was flat year over year but up sequentially. The contracts business including our fast-growing enterprise services business, double digits again in Q4 as it has every quarter this year. Our largest customers continue to maximize utilization of their assets, right-size their operations, and leverage OpEx budgets to deliver on their productivity goals and outcomes. We recently received a top supplier award from one of our largest strategic customers in the applied markets as a recognition of our long-standing and beneficial partnership throughout the years. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $442 million in revenue, representing a 3% decline that was slightly above expectations. Pathology saw solid growth globally, and was offset by expected softness in NESD and cell analysis instruments. Now looking at our end markets and geographies, our largest end market, pharma, declined 1%, slightly better than what we expected. Within pharma, biopharma declined mid-single digits while small molecule grew low single digits. Encouragingly, all regions except for the Americas, grew in the quarter. The Americas region was pressured by the expected decline of NASD. We expect both the Americas region and NASD to return to growth in fiscal year 2025. In chemicals and advanced materials, revenue grew 1% with our advanced materials submarket growing mid-single digits driven by our business in the semiconductor market. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical end market performed strongly growing 7% driven by pathology, and improved performance in genomics.\nOperator: In environmental and forensics,\nBob McMahon: we declined 6% although dollars were roughly flat sequentially. All regions grew except for the US, related to timing of orders. That being said, we continue to see very strong growth in PFAS solutions. With our business growing more than 40% in Q4 across multiple end markets. Now wrapping up our end markets, food was down 3% versus last year. While our academia and government market was down 1%. Geographically, Asia ex-China high single digits and Europe grew low single digits in the quarter while the Americas and China declined as expected. China was down only 3% and exceeded our expectations. We also booked our first China stimulus orders in October and anticipate much more in fiscal year 2025. Now let's move to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 55.1% in the quarter, down seventy basis points versus last year driven by lower volume and mix. Our operating margin was 27.4% as our productivity initiatives and the cost actions we took earlier in the year were fully recognized this quarter. The annualization of these savings coupled with the market recovery and the initial returns from the Ignite transformation, give us confidence in driving EPS growth in fiscal year 2025. In addition, we continue to look for ways to drive EPS growth below the line. Our net interest income was in line while we benefited from a lower tax rate in the quarter and our share count was 287 million diluted shares outstanding. Now putting it all together, Q4 earnings per share was $1.46, that was ahead of our expectations and up 6% from a year ago. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $481 million in the quarter, and we invested $93 million in capital expenditures. For the year, we well exceeded our operating cash flow expectations. With operating cash flow of $1.75 billion during the quarter, we returned over $400 million to shareholders, consisting of $335 million in share repurchases, and $68 million in dividends. For the year, we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders, through repurchasing shares and dividends. Looking forward, you may have also seen recently we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend. Marking another year of increases advancing our industry-leading dividend. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.1, a very strong number even as we acquired BioVectra in the quarter. Our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet provide us with plenty of opportunity to invest in the business going forward. In summary, we performed well and saw steady market improvement in the quarter. We are executing well, staying disciplined, and investing in high-growth opportunities. Now let's move on to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. We expect the recovery that we have seen the past few quarters to continue throughout fiscal 2025. While we expect the market to grow slower than historical rates for the full year, we expect improvement throughout the year with the second half of the year returning to more traditional levels of growth. We expect our results to mirror that cadence of improvement on a core basis. As Padraig noted earlier, we exited Q4 with a book-to-bill ratio over one for the company, and greater than one for instruments. In addition, Q4 was the first quarter in 2024 that instrument orders grew year on year. While one quarter does not a trend make, it is certainly encouraging. For the full year guide, we expect revenue in the range of $6.79 to $6.87 billion. This represents a reported growth range of 4.3% to 5.5%. Currency is a slight headwind of 0.2 points while M&A related to BioVectra contributes 2% at the low end and 2.2% at the high end. This translates to a core growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. To start the year, we think this is a prudent way to plan given the near-term dynamics in the US. From a geographic perspective, we expect modest growth in the Americas and Europe. While we see funnel activity increasing in China, we are taking a conservative approach on the timing of revenue associated with the stimulus. We expect to see recovery over the course of the year in China, resulting in slightly positive growth for the full year. From a business group perspective, we expect to return to growth in all three groups led by ACG. As a note, this statement is true under the new structure as well. As Parmeet mentioned earlier, we will provide recast historical segment information to reflect these changes ahead of our upcoming investor day. In terms of phasing, we expect improvement throughout the year with more normalized growth expected in the second half of the year. We are projecting roughly fifty to seventy basis points of operating margin expansion for the year. Below the line, we expect net interest expense of $25 million due to the financing of BioVectra versus the net interest income this year. In addition, we expect a tax rate of 13% and 286 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.54 to $5.61 and incorporates the planned five cents year one dilution from BioVectra. This range represents a 5% to 6% growth rate if excluding the BioVectra dilution, a growth rate of 6% to 7% year on year. We expect cash flow to remain strong in fiscal year 2025. We are expecting roughly $1.65 billion in operating cash flow and $450 million in CapEx as 2025 is the peak spending year for the NASD expansion. Looking to Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion. Our forecast assumes no significant budget flush during the end of this calendar year. This represents a reported decline of 0.5% to growth of 1.3%. Currency is a thirty basis point headwind while M&A is expected to contribute 1.8 points of growth. We are expecting core growth between a decline of 2% to flat at the upper end. It's important to note that we estimate our projected Q1 year-over-year results will be negatively impacted this year by roughly two percentage points due to timing of the Lunar New Year which occurs in late January, versus February of last year. This includes the additional $15 million in revenue pull forward we communicated in Q1 of last year. Adjusting for the Lunar New Year impact, we are expecting continued sequential growth improvement. First quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28. Lower than the full year growth rate due to the Lunar New Year timing. Looking into 2025 and beyond, we remain incredibly optimistic about the future of our markets and our long-term prospects. We are confident in our new market-focused approach and the Ignite transformation will propel us to accelerated growth and we will become a stronger company. With that, I'll turn it back over to Padraig for some closing comments.\nPadraig McDonnell: I've said it before and I want to say it again. These are exciting times at Agilent. Over the last several months, we've been focused on evolving our strategy, transforming our processes, and empowering our people while continuing to win in the marketplace. Already we've made bold moves that have created momentum. We've developed our future strategy, we've kicked off our Ignite transformation to help execute on that strategy. And along the way, we've made moves to create new growth vectors. We are making acquisitions that will contribute to our growth and we are strengthening our capability to efficiently and effectively integrate those acquisitions that will lay the foundation for future M&A. These initial actions position us well for the journey ahead.\nBob McMahon: They ensure we are building the capability\nPadraig McDonnell: strength, and speed to reinvigorate our culture and enable us to thrive while delivering outstanding results for our customers and for our shareholders. And amid all this change, Fortune magazine this month named Agilent number eleven among the world's best workplaces 2024, a list that only includes twenty-five companies. This is yet another recognition of what we already know internally. The Agilent team is the best in the industry. This is not only a recognition of our outstanding company culture, of the talented professionals we have.\nBob McMahon: Ones who are ambitious,\nPadraig McDonnell: resilient, and high performing. This is exactly the team we need to evolve Agilent. To build an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers, and creates value for our shareholders. Thank you again for joining today's call. I couldn't be more energized by the momentum we have, the opportunities we will seize, and the history we will make. Now I look forward to answering your questions. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Padraig. Operator, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.\nOperator: And your first question today comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Padraig, maybe one for you. Just on the instrument side, and I know you guys touched on the book-to-bill over one for three quarters now, a little bit of improved growth on the order side year over year. Can you talk about where we are in the cycle, what your expectations are? As you guys know, there's a debate in the market about what the cycle looks like. Does it overcorrect to the upside as we work our way through the next year or so? Are you guys framing that up? What's the right way to think about this replacement cycle, where we are, and the size of it as we go forward here?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Great question. So, you know, clearly, we're seeing a steady recovery in instruments and, you know, our book-to-bill was greater than one, which is really great to see. In terms of replacement cycle, what you would see across the industry is that it's not uniform. It's across different vendors at different speeds and, of course, at different times. But what we do see is that we have we're probably midway through the expected timing on where we expect that replacement cycle to be. We see competitors are probably benefiting from refresh of their own install base with some new systems. But what you would see from our side is our Infinity 3 that we announced last month. We expect to start seeing an increased demand for our solutions, and we're seeing a lot of excitement with our customer base. And we've already seen tens of millions of dollars in orders there. So what we expect in that replacement cycle is to be slow and steady, but really kicking off in Q1.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. And that's helpful. And then maybe on China, you know, always a focus with you guys. It sounds like slight growth for 2025 is the right way to think about it. Can you just talk about what you guys are seeing there and hearing there? You know, Bob, helpful to hear that you guys got your first orders there in October. What's the expectation as we move forward here? It sounds like a steady recovery. Are you still seeing I know you guys were kinda hovering around that $300 million revenue a quarter stability. It sounds like continued and maybe a little bit of improvements as we work our way through the year. Are there different segments that are maybe picking up a little bit? Would be helpful to talk through. Thank you, guys.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. So performance was a bit better than expected, and it was also really encouraging to see lab activity to continue to improve across our services and consumables. So we actually have seen quite dramatic share gains within China, which is also a really good point. So what I would say is it's steadily improving. You know, talking to the teams. And I would say on the stimulus side, you know, we talked in the call about we've already have some stimulus orders in. We expect much more in Q1. That will, of course, translate to revenue. And this is a really, really good sign as we see momentum both from the direct input of more confidence in the market and, of course, getting the dollars in. So steadily improving, and we expect that through the year, Patrick. We expect as we go through the stimulus orders and we go forward, expect that to improve. One area that was really standout for us was PFAS in China. It was the fastest-growing business for us across the globe or region across the globe, and that just goes to show the durable nature of some of these growth factors that are happening where you have the emergent pollutants act moving. And what we've seen in China is that our great technical expertise coupled with our great solutions are already there to pick up the business. So that was one real clear standout.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Patrick. Just want to add on to what Padraig is saying. Yeah. You're absolutely right. We ended the quarter with roughly $310 million, $312 to be precise, in China. Which was a nice sequential increase from Q3 and, you know, it was down 3% as I mentioned. In addition to the PFAS, both chemical and advanced materials actually grew in the quarter. We're, you know, we have a leadership position and pharma was flat, which was actually a very nice thing. And we're taking a kind of a conservative approach, as I mentioned, in terms of the stimulus orders, but we've seen quite active funnel from the standpoint of bidding activity here in the first half of this quarter as well as and expect that to continue throughout the course of 2025.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Bob and Padraig. I appreciate it.\nPadraig McDonnell: Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first one just on DGG, which has been sort of weighing on growth over the course of the year, but noticeably strong quarter. You had called out CancerDx as well as genomics. Could you just provide a little bit more color on what's driving that growth? And how sustainable do you think that growth is, particularly in genomics as we move through 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. I just said start off, and I'll kick it over to Simon. You know, as we really are seeing nice growth in our pathology business, which grew high single digits in Q4 and is slightly ahead of expectations. A highly durable business in any markets. What we're seeing in genomics, while it's a still challenging market, we posted low single-digit growth, which was also ahead of expectations. But, Simon, I don't know if you want to add some color.\nSimon May: Yeah. Just a quick couple of quick points to add. As Padraig mentioned, we were pretty pleased with the high single-digit growth that we saw in pathology in the quarter. And in particular, the blend and the mix between instruments and consumables there, we continue to be really healthy. With our instrument placements, and we think that sees us quite nicely going into 2025. On the genomic side, it was really notable because it's the first time that we've seen growth in genomics for quite a while now. I'd say we've had a bit of a pivot in our strategy there to really double down on the growth drivers that we see in genomics, where we've got clearly differentiated value propositions and in particular, our Magnus automated NGS library prep continues to see fantastic traction. We're also very encouraged by the pipeline that we're seeing for our Aveda NGS chemistry. And, again, this gives us a lot of hope going into FY 2025. And as I think about pathology and genomics and these growth factors that we see here, we do believe that they're durable given the macro conditions and the competitive position that we enjoy.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thanks. And maybe just for my follow-up, a high-level question for you, Padraig. On the resegmentation, it makes sense from a go-to-market strategy for some of these segments to put them together. I'm wondering from an R&D development and new product innovation, how this might help. I mean, you referenced the LC replacement cycle accelerating faster for competitors as they refresh their installed base. Should we start to see a faster cycle of new product introductions due to the resegmentation, or is it gonna be similar to the pace that we've seen in the past and resegmentation really doesn't necessarily inform R&D direction?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Well, look, I think we're refocusing the groups really for a few reasons. We want to be closer to customers, but also understanding where do we want to make our biggest investment or most asymmetric that are going to accelerate innovation in key areas. And when I talk about focus, it's really three things. You know, it's the energy to time, but also the capital allocation. And what you will see from this refocusing of our segments, we're gonna be able to do that. You're gonna see programs accelerate. But also, we don't want to be two inches deep across the company. We want to be focused on our key growth factors and making sure we accelerate. We have a huge amount of product lines and, of course, we can have incremental additions to product lines across the board. But from this new structure, you're gonna see an acceleration of R&D. No doubt about it.\nMatt Sykes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rachael Raycroft with Your line is open.\nRachael Raycroft: Perfect. Thank you for taking the questions, you guys, and good afternoon. So I wanted to follow-up on Patrick's question on China. Appreciate that it's early days, but how are you guys thinking about the risk of potential tariffs on Agilent's business at this point in China and in the rest of the world? Is there anything embedded in guidance currently from a tariff standpoint? And then can you remind us what was the tariff impact on Agilent in the first Trump administration?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Rachael. This is Bob. I'll take that question. As you can imagine, there's been a fair amount of work that we've been doing on this exact question. What I would take it if I took it into two chunks, actually, we've been working on diversifying our supply chain particularly within China, you know, China, back in eighteen, nineteen when the first tariffs came and then, obviously, double down on that resiliency with COVID. And so it is ten to fifteen million dollars existing today. And we think that the future potential magnitude of this is certainly manageable with us with additional mitigation activities. Obviously, with something that would be more broad-based than that, it would be more material. But to just give you a frame of reference, roughly two-thirds of our business in the US comes from product that's sourced in the US.\nRachael Raycroft: Great. That's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, you mentioned that chemical and advanced materials grew 1% this quarter. Was wondering, could you just break down some of the trends that you saw within? You mentioned that semiconductors drove some of the performance that you saw on the advanced materials side. We actually had one of your peers call out some weakness in semi this quarter. So just talk to us about what you're seeing from an underlying perspective on that side. And then again, just tell me business as well. Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. So in the chemical advance materials, we grew 1% and we sold 4% of materials, and that's driven, you know, a lot by our battery business that we have and, of course, semiconductor. We saw a slight decline in chemical and energy. But overall, we're very happy with the growth that we've seen in Asia ex-China, by the way, was driven and also low single digits in China. So the one thing that I would note about this industry is that we've got the broadest platform and solutions around it. And it's the CAM is returning to positive year on year growth for the first time since Q2 in 2023, so that really bodes well for the future.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Rachael. And maybe just for the benefit of you and the rest of the folks on the call, I talked about guidance. If you look at it by end market, just to kinda give everyone a frame, you know, for the full year FY 2025, we're expecting pharma to return to growth. So low to mid-single-digit growth there. Academia government roughly flat. Actually, expect the diagnosis and clinical that Simon just talked about to continue and be the highest growth end market, at least to start off the year here in FY 2025 at mid-single digits. CAM also low to mid, given the work and the discussion that Padraig just gave. And then food and environmental, both low single digits with pockets of very strong growth. And really, you know, food, there was a potential where the actually could accelerate throughout the course of the year given some of the potential changes in the administration coming up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe building off of the last question here on the drivers of fiscal 2025. When you look at the first half versus second half, it does assume a back half step up. We're just curious. Is that being driven by end markets normalizing? Maybe if you could just walk us through from first half versus back half dynamics in fiscal 2025?\nBob McMahon: Yeah, Vijay. That's exactly right. So, you know, obviously, our first quarter is what I would call artificially depressed just because of the way of the nature of our timing of our fiscal year relative to Lunar New Year. But if you looked at first half versus second half, we're expecting this continued recovery throughout the course of the year. And with a more normalized growth in the back half of the year. And so where does that show up? It shows up in a couple of areas. Obviously, with the potential for China getting better throughout the course of the year. As Padraig mentioned, certainly, stimulus can help that. We've taken a conservative approach on that and not fully baked in with all the activity that we talked about. We'll see how that plays out, but certainly early days are very positive from that standpoint. And then also from a pharma perspective, we're also expecting to see that recovery particularly on the back of Infinity 3 as Padraig just mentioned, and that replacement cycle accelerating. So you're actually seeing those that would be the two biggest and then, you know, continued biotech recovery on the small biotech side as well throughout the course of next year.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then one on that maybe margins, we cash. Pretty impressive free cash execution in fiscal 2024. Just wanna make sure I have the numbers right. Is the guide assuming free cash flow down above it, there's a timing element and on the margin sort of similar cadence question, what is Q1 assuming and what drives the back half step up in margins? Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. So Q1, so let me answer your question around free cash flow. Yeah. We are expecting a slight slip down really a result of a step up in CapEx spending this year versus last year. As we, you know, finished the heavy levels of spending for the NASD expansion for Trane CND. I don't expect that to continue into 2026 and 2027, so you would see that then step back down. So that free cash flow is really a timing issue. In terms of Q1, profitability with the lower revenue, we typically have higher expenses in Q1 as some of the merit resets. We've got our sales meetings and kickoffs meetings there, and then you've got, you know, some January typically is a very light month, but we have a full amount of expenses in there. And then you then also look at the Ignite transformation that Padraig talked about, many of those activities that we've been kicking off will come into play in the second half of the year, which will generate incremental savings both on the top line and the bottom line. And what you'll hear more about that, some of those details at the Investor Day in mid-December.\nVijay Kumar: And so thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just walk us through for the 2025 guide what this assumes for each of the segments. Not sure if you can provide it under the old method or just the new method, but any color would be great.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. I could do that. So if you think about this at, I'll call it legacy number. So LSAG kinda low single digits with the consumables business being kind of mid-single-digit and slower on the instrument throughout the course of the year. That's probably our area where we've taken a prudent approach as we go through the course of the year. It could be more than that, depending on the uptake of the replacement cycle INFINITY 3, but low single digits there. ACG continued to be very strong with mid to high single digits as the instrumentation recovery and then continued double-digit on the services business. Just continues to be a real stalwart of growth, and we still have a lot of opportunity there around rate. And then for DGG, kind of low to mid-single-digit growth. Going forward, which is a recovery, you know, the continued performance of pathology in the genomics businesses, as Simon mentioned, and then a return to growth really for NESD.\nJack Meehan: Right. Okay. And then wondering if you could just talk a little bit more just what your expectations are for LC, LCMS. I think everybody's trying to benchmark expectations for next year and one of your peers sounds a little bit more bullish as it pertains to the cycle. So I don't know if you have any thoughts as we try and compare and contrast some of these results. Any color would be great. And maybe just off of that, any comments you can share around GLP one contribution I think that might be a factor, but any color would be great. Thank you.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. So, you know, there's a lot of dynamism in terms of replacement cycle. You know, it doesn't happen at any time, as I said before, any one time, but it's across the board in different industries and different times. From our perspective, you know, our LC and LCMS orders are improving. There's no doubt about that. And we have a huge amount of excitement around our Infinity 3. We have a lot of focus programs with our customers around that. So what you will see next year is I think it's a steady increase in cadence of that replacement cycle. You know, it's a little bit too early to call. Will that be gradual over a number of quarters or a bolus in one quarter or maybe then a slowdown and again on the next quarter? But we're really watching that as we go forward. I think we're being very conservative around what we're seeing on that because of a lot of turbulences everybody has seen in the last few years in the market. But I would say customer sentiment is steadily improving. And on the GLP One side, you know, we had a really fantastic year. We grew 30% in GLP one this year. We're involved in a lot of new site build-outs in QAQC departments and actual getting closer to production as well with systems. So a very, very strong year. And actually one thing that's really interesting is through the acquisition of BioVectra, we, of course, have a healthy pipeline of GLP-one and synthetic peptides within their CDMO capability. We're seeing a lot of requests from both sides of the business about how we can help customers both on the analytical side and on the CDMO side. So we're seeing a huge amount of synergies there. So this is a market that's going to continue very strongly and we're going to be really there to take the business.\nBob McMahon: Hey, Jack. Just to build on what Padraig is saying on the LC replacement cycle, I think one of the things is, you know, we're taking a more conservative approach as Padraig mentioned. And I think if that happens, we will get that business rest assured. I would also say, if we look at the age of our installed base, it is continuing to get old. It is well beyond the median now. And throughout the course of next year. So we would expect that to continue to be able to be replaced. Because when we look at the instrumentation through our consumables business and our services business, the activity continues to be high. So these instruments are being used, and so it's only a matter of time to be able to do that replacement.\nJack Meehan: Awesome. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from UBS. Hi. Thank you. Just to clarify on instruments one last time, is your expectation that instrument growth is flat in 2025?\nBob McMahon: In aggregate across all platforms, our expectation is that it will grow. Low single digits.\nDan Leonard: Okay. And then my follow-up. You mentioned, I think, something about the administration and changes in your food forecast. Are there any other areas where you think the change in US administration could impact your business? Any other areas that you were sensitive to putting together your forecast for 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Look, there's a lot of changes that can happen at this time. You know, there's a lot of people expecting a lot of change. We have yet to see what those changes will be. Of course, you can see maybe some changes in the NIH funding, which is very low for us as a percentage of the business. We actually expect the PFAS spending will actually increase as it goes forward on it. The area to watch, I would say, is, of course, tariffs, which Bob talked about. We're ready for that. Ready for any scenario on that side. But also on biopharma, I think, is the IRA is also continues to move forward, the International Pricing Index seeing what happens on biopharma is gonna be really important. So that's why we're taking a kind of conservative and prudent approach. So lots going on. But what I would say is from the strategy work, I would imagine, we're ready for all outcomes.\nDan Leonard: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yeah. Hi, Padraig, Bob, thanks for taking my questions. First one, just wanted to clarify on the tariff side. I mean, if there were any retaliatory tariffs could you elaborate on your manufacturing and final assembly positions just globally so we can understand sort of how much of the product is sort of China for China, made in China versus made in other Asian countries and not coming from the US.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Maybe I can start off by talking about our, you know, our US supply chain in there. About 60%, as Bob said, is produced in the United States. About 35% is the rest of the world. So it's actually a small percentage that's produced in China. But, of course, we have mitigations and steps there. We have many supply chain areas across the globe that we can move around, and we've done that before since 2018. We expect the impact probably in the quarter of $4 million to $5 million we can probably mitigate that within a few months. So I would say we're waiting to see how that all plays out. But we're already taking steps across potential tariffs. The big question for everybody is that will it be on will it be beyond China? I think everybody's waiting to see what that is, but even in that case, we're ready with mitigations.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Puneet. To build on what Padraig is saying, particularly for retaliatory tariffs in China, very little of our revenue now is produced in the US that goes into China. We spent a lot of time and effort building in China for China, and we have a full portfolio of capabilities there. Which is actually really important for us to be able to take full advantage of the stimulus products today. So, and, you know, I think that number will be relatively small. From the standpoint of retaliatory impact from China exports from the US.\nPuneet Souda: That's helpful. Thanks. And then, I have a question on Infinity 3 series. Just wondering, given the launch timing, was there any pause that you saw in on the instrumentation? And what is the order book telling you? Do you think this is what's driving, you know, is it a major driver of instrumentation orders in the quarter being positive as you pointed out?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. You know, we had a minimal effect to be honest. We really planned around that and of course, we are very careful with our customers to make sure we bring them through the cycle of replacement. So minimal impact. You know, we're very extremely excited about it. You know, it's a system that not only will be best in class in terms of performance, but also in terms of productivity. And that's what we're hearing loud and clear from our customers. It's about productivity and how it lends their labs to be more productive going forward. We're extremely pleased with the order book that we've seen so far. And we expect that that will continue to ramp and, you know, customers are really voting with their orders on that. So we're excited about that ramp for next year.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Thank you. Look forward to the investor day.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Wanted to probe in a little bit. Are you able to delineate what LC did and what mass spec did in the quarter? And then just thinking a little bit about the new administration, I know you're not guiding for any budget flush here, but is there any risk of kind of pause in spending given all the moving pieces around pharma? What are you hearing from customers at this point?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Maybe I can start with the second part, Tycho. We're not seeing a pause from pharma validating. We're actually seeing a little bit more activity. So we're not seeing that across the board, and that's about the US and globally. And, of course, that's something we really want to watch with the new administration coming in. And what transpires over the next few weeks. But in terms of the LC and LCMS, Bob, I don't know if you got any color on those.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Tycho. Just to give you a couple of different pieces of data. If I look at our pharma business overall, it was down low single digits. Pharma, small molecule was actually up 3% overall with biotech or biopharma being down. If we look at specifically LC, LCMS, within pharma, it was up low single digits.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up on NASD, I know I think you're talking back to growth in 2025. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about your ability to cross-sell with BioVectra and then how are you thinking about clinical versus commercial customers?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. I'll start off, Tycho, and I'll hand it over to Simon. You know, first of all, we are extremely pleased on the cross-selling ability between the two businesses. It was one of the key sources of value about why we did the BioVectra acquisition that customers were asking us for this capability, a broader range of capability, and we've seen that actually accelerate from both sides. Simon, I don't know if you want to add more color on NESD.\nSimon May: Yeah. Just to build on what Padraig said with BioVectra and the NASD cross-pollination, there's been really strong engagement between the teams. In fact, they spent several days together in our Boulder facility last week, and I'd say they came away really energized that the portfolio complementarity fit between businesses is exactly as we expected. In fact, maybe a little bit more so. Then as we think about NASD going into FY 2025, I think as Bob mentioned earlier, we're projecting high single-digit growth for the business. The order book looks really strong in NASD, but it's important to understand the nuances of the mix in that order book. We've got a number of commercialization qualifications going on right now. So in terms of FY 2025 revenue, there's a lot of energy going into that with relatively limited revenue upside, and a lot of that's gonna actually hit towards FY 2026. But, again, the order book overall is very healthy. And as we think about twelve, eighteen, twenty-four months view, we're really bullish about what we're seeing. But once again, high single-digit growth, maybe we'll nudge double-digit in NASD in FY 2025?\nTycho Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBrandon Couillard: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just on the Infinity 3 launch, can you remind us, you know, when the Infinity 2 I think it's the 1290 system rolled out. And what's the is there an ASP premium? Is there an ASP kicker to this replacement cycle this time as well to the three versus the legacy two system. Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. We don't talk about a difference in pricing on it, you know, but I think we've had a number of years, of course, very, very successful years with the Infinity 2 and this builds on success. I will say that the installed base for Agilent is way broader than the Infinity 2. You know, we have 1100s that are very, very prominent out there. We have a lot of labs with 1100s and those are the labs for us, I think, that are gonna be talking about replacement. But we also have seen significant interest from Infinity 2 customers because the CDXTR productivity capability is really going to help them in the lab. So I would say it's not just, you know, one series to the next. It's a broad install base replenishment we're gonna see.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. All I would say is pricing has held up very nicely. Early days.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. And then Bob, how much of the CapEx is in Nexter is tied to the train B and build out for NASD, we expect those to come online, and what does maintenance CapEx look like? In fiscal 2026? Thanks.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. That's a great question. So roughly half is NASD between the continued build-out and the validation activities of that $450 million. If I look at, kinda maintenance CapEx, think about it in, you know, kinda two and a half to three times sales. Range on a go-forward basis.\nBrandon Couillard: That's total cover. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDoug Schenkel: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to start first with a question on guidance philosophy. Just to be clear, it sounds like you're trying to factor in a degree of conservatism on China stimulus, the impact of uncertainty as it relates to the new administration, and conservatism on a potential LC replacement cycle. Hopefully, I'm not missing anything there. But is it fair to say that the error bar around your assumptions are wider than normal heading into a new fiscal year and your intent across the board was to make assumptions that were consistently on the lower end of those error bars?\nPadraig McDonnell: I think you said it well. You know, we were very conservative in that because of those reasons, you know, what is the expected LC replacement cycle recovery? Is it faster? Is it, you know, is it a little bit less than that? The China stimulus, you know, which is very early days, you know, I think we want to make sure that we continue to monitor that. And, of course, whether we see improved conditions or not in terms of sentiment in the US. So all of these things are factoring into this. So it is conservative in what we're guiding, but also I'd say here, the bars are wider than normal.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. Thank you for that. And just as always, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe in your prepared remarks, you indicated that small molecule was up low single digits while biopharma was down mid-singles. If I have that right, is that comp effect, or are you seeing more of a recovery in demand amongst, you know, small versus large molecule applications, and I guess, finally, if so, why? That seems to be a little contradicting just curious if you could give us a little more there.\nBob McMahon: Yeah, Doug. You know, you heard it right. Our small molecule business was up low single digits across both instruments. You know, it was the combination of instruments and services. And our biotech, our large molecule was down mid-singles. Now if you took out NASD, which shows up in the large molecule, it was down low single digits. So better recovery than the mid-single digits. And it actually speaks to, I think, that continuation of volume in small molecule. You know, if you look at pill count, it continues to go up. And these are, you know, well-capitalized companies. They have probably the older fleet you just think about kind of the replacement versus kind of the biotechs of the world, and so we're expecting that to continue and, it was the first to kind of go down. And so we're, you know, in the cycle, and I think we're expecting it to be the first, you know, moving positive. Now we think there's more upside in biotech than there is in small molecule, but it certainly is a nice leading indicator around the idea around this replacement cycle.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Line is open.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to ask a quick follow-up on China stimulus. I know you kinda touched on them in a couple of different questions. But early in the prepared remarks, you did make some comments of, you know, seeing some initial China stimulus orders come in. I think China in the quarter exceeded your expectations. I know there's not a lot embedded directly into the guide. But could you just walk us through sort of, like, how China's stimulus could play out next year? And I'm asking this from a perspective of, you know, gradual ramp as you go through the year. Is it gonna be a trickle? Is it could it be very back-end loaded? It's just trying to think through the various scenarios and what you're looking for there. Once the initial order is clear.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Look. I think what we've seen is that it's much broader. The stimulus in terms of range. We spoke about that before. We see it, you know, both on commercial and government accounts. Our first orders have actually come in from government accounts. We've been highly successful in those overall tenders, and we're in the low millions range, low single-digit millions range of orders to bring. We're expecting to close much more this quarter. And one thing that's really playing into our favor is our broad platform capabilities. Including the technical capabilities of our teams up and running. And you couple that with our Made in China initiatives that we really invested over the last year, it puts us in a very, very strong position to capitalize, but it'll be interesting to see how that's launched. Past the first quarter, we don't have great visibility yet, but, of course, a lot of deal activity. But the first quarter is looking very strong in terms of orders.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Mike. And just to kind of frame it, kind of how we're thinking about China to your point. If we took Q4 and just divide it by or multiply it by four, that would get you to that low single-digit growth. Now we're expecting a recovery throughout the course of the year, but that kind of gives you a sense for what we put in the initial guide and we'll know a lot more about those timing of the stimulus revenues going forward. You know, once we actually get those awarded and then the delivery dates and so forth. But we do think that that'll occur throughout the course of the year.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Bob, maybe for you, just on the margin guide for next year, fifty to seventy bps. So really impressive starting point honestly better than I think a lot expected. Especially given, you know, still a little bit of a subdued top-line environment. How much of that can you attribute to Ignite and sort of, you know, maybe some of the transformation or one-time cost savings, how much is just the underlying strength of the business, maybe beside the price or some mix shift next year? Just a little bit of what's going into that margin expansion for next year?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. What I would say, Mike, is it's a little of all those things. So maybe stay tuned, and we'll give you a little more meat on the bones here come mid-December. But we certainly have some incremental opportunities both in price and, you know, cost efficiencies associated with the Ignite transformation. And those things will start to feather into the second half of this year, as I mentioned before. If you recall, the first half of this year also has the annualization of the savings of the actions that we had to take in the June, July time frame as well. So we're benefiting and then you also have the merit increases and so forth that gets reset. And so you'll actually see this throughout the course of the year through a series of initiatives that have already been kicked off.\nPadraig McDonnell: And I would say just following up on that, Bob, we're very excited to meet everybody in December in New York to talk about it. It's an extremely well-thought-out program. It's across the board. It's ultimately gonna help us to invest for growth in key areas as well as margin expansion.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions here. Maybe the first one just on pharma. In the Americas. I think you called that in the prepared remarks Americas Pharma XMASD was kind of maybe a weaker spot. You just unpack a little bit what's happening in, you know, US versus, say, Europe, rest of the world and kind of, you know, what's kind of assumed from what happened in 4Q in 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. I mean, look, we saw a lot of strength in Europe in terms of pharma. I wouldn't read too much into the American numbers. You know, I think there is, of course, companies wondering about their CapEx budgets and that comes at different phases. But we expect, we expect Pharma to continue.\nDan Brennan: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on if I can just go into the broader market. I know you talked about the period in Mark's, Bob, and a few times it came up like you're expecting a below-trend market. At least it sounds like for the first half of the year, can you just remind us in terms of your kind of growth algorithm maybe, like, what would what is your assumptions based upon for a market growth typically? Kinda what are you assuming? And kind of specifically, is it just pharma that's weaker? Or are there other spots that you're pointing to that are below trend? And, you know, any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Yeah, Dan, if we looked at the long-term growth rates of our markets, we believe those are mid-single digits, you know, four to when you look at the aggregate across. We're obviously not expecting that for the full year here. We are expecting that we're doing better than the market. If you look at kinda how we exited here roughly flat on a core basis, you know, if you adjust for the timing of Lunar New Year, you know, you had the midpoint one percent, you know, and expect that kind of performance to continue that cadence. And so you would have the second half of the year a more normalized kind of growth rates. And so it's really across the board. We're seeing, you know, some of the industrial or applied markets things like CAM being a little ahead of the curve and certainly our diagnostics and clinical business continues to be strong. It has been throughout the course of this year. Exiting at a very healthy rate, and I would expect that to continue. The big ones are pharma coming in and then, you know, some of the other applied markets as well.\nOperator: And this concludes the question and answer session. Mr. Ahuja, I turn the call back over to you.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Rob, and thanks everyone for joining the call today. Before we sign off, I'd like to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving. Have a good rest of the day and week everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja, to begin. Please go ahead.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Phil Binns, President of the Agilent Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group; Simon May, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Angelica Riemann, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our third quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion, along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rate. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure related to the move of our Cell Analysis business from LSAG into DGG. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risk and other factors. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Thanks, Parmeet. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. The Agilent team executed well in the third quarter and posted solid results, delivering better-than-expected revenue and earnings. Revenue of $1.578 billion, declined 4.4%, an improvement of 300 basis points from Q2, reflecting the steady improvement in the market. Operating margin of 27.4% improved sequentially, as the actions we announced last quarter start to deliver. And we remain on-track to deliver the incremental annualized savings of $100 million by the end of the fiscal year. Earnings per share of $1.32 is $0.04 above the high end of guidance. As a result of our strong Q3 performance, we are raising our guidance at the midpoint for both revenue and EPS and we continue to make investments in our most promising growth opportunities that I referenced in our Q2 call. We are investing in our digital ecosystem to further enhance our differentiated customer experience, plus we are mobilizing the organization to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives, driving margin expansion and growth and increasing our execution capabilities. Separately in the quarter, we were excited to announce two acquisitions that demonstrate our focus on biopharma and our digital ecosystem, which I'll talk about in a moment. As you know well, the pace of change is faster than ever. Our markets, customers and competitors are not standing still, neither are we. We are accelerating our pace of innovation and execution, so we can add to and capitalize on opportunities in front of us. We are sharply focused on key growth vectors, including biopharma, PFAS and Advanced Materials. I continue to meet and connect with employees, customers and shareholders around the globe to listen to their perspectives on how we should build on our strengths and move Agilent forward. The entire Agilent team is clear on what is vital to the company's future, becoming even more customer focused and even more nimble to continue to win in the marketplace and add value to customers and shareholders. We are evolving our strategy, adapting quickly to market trends and changes, while accelerating our pace of innovation in areas of greatest return for long-term growth. We're excited to announce that you'll hear more about these topics and our transformation at our Investor Day we have planned in New York on December 17th. Now, let's talk further about our Q3 results. All our end markets except academia and government, which is our smallest, ended the quarter better-than-expected. Our largest market pharma declined high-single-digits, slightly better than our expectations and while biopharma continues to be pressured, we are seeing relatively better performance in small molecule. Our leadership in providing workflow solutions for PFAS continued to show strong performance in the environmental markets. Geographically, Europe exceeded expectations led by small-molecule pharma, as well as continued strength in environmental. Our other regions performed roughly in-line with expectations. While capital equipment budgets remain constrained, we continue to see good lab activity in Q3 with services plus consumables growing mid-single digits. When looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $782 million in revenue, down 7%, while the instrument side of the business remains constrained, it was encouraging that our instrument book-to-bill was again greater than one. The group saw a decline across all regions and most end-markets with low single-digit growth in Environmental & Forensics. The Consumables continue to be a bright spot, growing by mid-single digit. The LSAG team also was busy innovating with the introduction of the 8850 GC that helps customers reach their sustainability goals by delivering answers efficiently, while using up to 30% less power than other GC's and has a much smaller footprint. Moving on to the Agilent CrossLab Group, the business delivered revenue of $411 million for the quarter, up mid-single digit. ACG grew in every region except China, where we were down modestly year-on-year, but showed meaningful improvement versus last quarter. Once again, we drove double-digit growth in service contracts, which represented nearly 70% of the total business. And beyond another quarter of solid revenue growth, ACG also delivered a record operating margin of 34%, demonstrating that the resiliency and strength of the recurring revenue business continues despite the constrained capital equipment environment. The continued strength of our business is a testament to our strategy of increasing the connect rates on our instruments and the ongoing value we are providing to our customers in helping them reach their productivity goals. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $385 million in revenue, representing an 8% decline. Pathology grew mid-single digits globally and was offset by declines in Cell Analysis, NASD and genomics. NASD stepped down sequentially in Q3 as expected and we are on track for NASD's revenues to step-up sequentially in Q4. In the face of a constrained CapEx environment, the Agilent team has remained consistent in putting our customers first and fostering deeper relationships with them. We continue to execute well and be disciplined, while investing in high-growth opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to announce two acquisitions, that speak to our focus on biopharma and increasing recurring revenue, as well as on strengthening the digital ecosystem for Agilent customers. In late July, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire BIOVECTRA, a leading specialized contract development and manufacturing organization. The Canada-based company builds on Agilent's capabilities in oligonucleotides and CRISPR therapeutics by expanding our portfolio of services. BIOVECTRA adds rapidly growing modalities in microbial fermentation, antibody-drug conjugates and high-potency active pharmaceutical ingredients. It also brings world-class capabilities that when combined with NASD enables us to deliver customers a complete gene editing solution. The company delivered more than $110 million in revenue during the calendar year 2023 and expects double-digit revenue growth this year. The BIOVECTRA acquisition remains on-track to be closed by the end of the year and we're looking-forward to welcoming the BIOVECTRA team to Agilent. At the end of the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of California-based Sigsense, a start-up that uses artificial intelligence and power monitoring to help customers optimize their lab operations. Sigsense Technology already is available to our customers through CrossLab Connect, a suite of digital applications that improve lab performance. A hearty welcome to the Sigsense team who already is part of Agilent. During the quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which showcases a large and growing portfolio of products that help our customers reach their sustainability goals. Instruments certified with the My GreenLab ACT label now accounts for 40% of all instrument revenue and we continue to regularly release products like the new 8850 GC with environmental benefits. We are also proud that we have recently ranked in the top 20 of Time Magazine's 500 Most Sustainable companies in the world. Bob will now provide the details on our results, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Thanks, Padraig and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full-year and fourth quarter guidance. Q3 revenue was $1.578 billion, a decline of 4.4% core, but a 300 basis-point sequential improvement as Padraig noted. Excluding China, revenue declined low-single digits in the quarter. On a reported basis, currency had a negative impact of 1.1 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 10 basis points, resulting in a reported decline of 5.6%. Our largest end market pharma declined 8%. Biopharma was down low double-digits or down mid-single digits, excluding NASD. Small molecule performed better, down mid-single digits and was led by growth in Europe. Services and pharma continues to perform well, growing high single-digit. In Chemical & Advanced Materials, revenue declined 5%, with growth in Americas offset by softness in China. Our Advanced Materials sub-segment performed better, driven by our business in the semiconductor market. Academia and government, our smallest market, can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We saw a decline of 11% as Europe and China both saw double-digit declines, partially offset by better performance in the Americas region. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical end-market grew 2%, including continued mid-single digit growth in pathology, offset by ongoing softness in genomics. In Environmental & Forensics, we grew 4%, another great quarter for our PFAS testing business. We saw robust business in Europe, led by the new EU Water Directive and in China due to the nationwide emerging pollutants program. Now wrapping up our end-markets, food was down 3% versus last year, but grew sequentially and was led by Asia, ex-China. Moving on to our regional performance, Europe was flat overall, beating our expectations, while we declined 6% in the Americas and declined 1% in Asia, ex-China. China revenue declined 11% with quarterly revenue improving sequentially, driven by growth in services and consumables. This speaks to some increase in lab activity, which is encouraging. Now, let's move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 56.0% in the quarter, down slightly versus a year-ago, but up 40 basis points sequentially. Our operating margin of 27.4% improved sequentially and was better-than-expected. Despite the dampened demand, we continue to make good progress in driving our productivity initiatives and continuing to manage the cost structure very well, while investing for growth. As Padraig mentioned, we are on track to deliver the $100 million in incremental annualized cost-savings by the end of the fiscal year. Below the line, our net interest income was in line as was our tax rate of 13% and we had $291 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.32. That was ahead of our expectations, but down 7.7% from a year ago as we went up against a difficult compare due to the variable pay reset in Q3 of last year. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $452 million in the quarter and we invested $92 million in capital expenditures. As we committed in Q2, we ramped-up our share repurchases starting here in Q3. We purchased $585 million in shares and paid out $68 million through dividends, for a total of $653 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. This includes $500 million of the previously announced $750 million opportunistic share repurchase and we expect to complete the additional $250 million repurchase in Q4. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of $0.6 and even with the upcoming BIOVECTRA acquisition, our balance sheet and leverage ratios will still be in a very strong position. In summary, we performed well and continue to see a steady improvement in the market and expect that to continue into FY 2025. Because of our Q3 results, we are increasing the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $6.450 billion to $6.500 billion. This represents a decline of 5.6% to 4.9% on a reported basis and a decline of 5.0% to 4.3% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 60 basis points. Full-year non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $5.21 and $5.25, representing a decline of 4.2% to 3.5%. This assumes net interest income of $38 million, a 13% tax rate and $292 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We have not included any impact of the BIOVECTRA acquisition in our updated guidance and $0.06 does not have a material financial impact to the year or Q4. This full-year guidance translates into Q4 revenue in the range of $1.641 billion to $1.691 billion. This represents a decline of 1.9% to 1.1% growth on a core basis and a decline of 2.8% to 0.2% growth on a reported basis. Currency and M&A are a combined headwind of 90 basis-points. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.38 and $1.42, marking a return to growth at the midpoint. We expect a 13% tax rate, a decrease in net interest income to $5 million due to the lower cash balance and $287 million diluted shares outstanding for the quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Padraig for some closing comments. Padraig?\nPadraig McDonnell: These are exciting times at Agilent, with a team that is second to known, we are doubling down on our customer force culture and deepening our relationships to further enhance our market leading customer experience that is already the best in the industry. We are evolving our strategy to aggressively pursue our ambition to grow in markets where we have a right to win through both organic and inorganic growth and we will continue to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives. We remain a leader across key platforms and we're in great long-term growth markets that are beginning to show evidence of recovery. And best of all, our team is engaged, leading to Newsweek including Agilent on its America's Greatest Workplaces 2024 list. Again, thank you for joining today's call. I'm energized by how we are evolving Agilent. Each data team gains momentum in building an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers and creates value for our shareholders. We are fueled by the future possibilities and I look forward to continuing to share our progress. Parmeet, over to you for Q&A.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, just digging in a little bit on the LSAG where you had a pretty solid beat. It looks like that was driven primarily by consumables and services. So, I'm curious if you can give any more color on what instruments did? I know you had a book-to-bill above one, but just how does that inform your view as we go into 2025 on the replacement cycle, specifically large biopharma demand and how that might impact your view on when that replacement cycle starts kicking-in?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks a lot, Matt, maybe I'll kick it off and give it to Bob. I think, first of all, you're correct, we saw very, very promising growth in both Consumables & Services, which shows lab activity is actually improving or is very stable. We're still very challenged on the instrument side, but what we're seeing is, we're seeing a lot of activity around conversations with lab managers. Our funnel is extremely stable. We haven't seen any -- any cancellations. But what I would say is that, deal closure times are still elevated. So we're not at this point seeing any budget towards the end of the year and which of course for us ends at the end of October, but we're watching that closely. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Thanks, Matt, for that question and maybe just to fill in and add some additional commentary to what Padraig was saying. When we looked at the quarter, we were very pleased actually both our Consumables business, as well as our Instrument business performed better-than-expected in the quarter. We were down 7% in total. Our Consumables business was actually up mid-single digits towards the high-end there. And our Instruments business was down low-double-digits, but that was better than what we expected. And as Padraig mentioned, we had a book-to-bill that was greater than one on the instrument side again this quarter, which was very encouraging.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. Thanks for that. Very helpful. And then just on Academic & Government, I know you've talked about it and you've talked about it for a while, how volatile that can be, but just given sort of the two quarters in a row of sort of negative performance there and you called out Europe and China specifically. Are there any kind of durable trends you're seeing either in funding or in demand that you think might be more persistent in that specific end-market as we go through Q4 and then as we look into 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: No, I think, look, we saw a decline of about 11% and that was really against the comparative feature, the stimulus in EMEA and strong results in APAC and China. And so it was a really tough compare. And I think what we're seeing is funding remains stable in most regions and except I would say Europe where we're seeing a reallocation of funding towards defense, but I would say no major changes in that market.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions you guys. I wanted to dig into NASD a little bit. Obviously, we had some positive announcements intra quarter with the Helios-B readout. You mentioned that NASD stepped down sequentially as expected and then you said you're expecting that to then step up into fiscal 4Q. So could you unpack all that for us a little bit? How should we think about the magnitude of the step-up into 4Q? And then given some of the updated data readouts that we got intra quarter, how does that underpin your assumptions on NASD next year and then also long-term?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I'll start off and maybe I'll hand it over to Simon, who is on the call here as well. We've seen, with clinical batches, of course, there can be changes with customers progress in those batches. We're not seeing any changes in what we're saying for Q4, so we're fairly certain of Q4 on that. What we're seeing as well is that we've grown our clinical business over 50% this year, which is very promising. The long range view of the market is very strong with the drugs and the modalities that are being used. But I think what you're seeing is a normal kind of up and down between quarters with that business. But I don't know if you want to add any more color, Simon?\nSimon May: Yes, I'd just echo what Padraig said, I think the Q3 performance that we saw in NASD was largely in line with expectations. And in that business, we always see a natural lag between order booking activity and revenue recognition because of the length of time that these programs take. And towards the end of last year, we were really seeing the effects of the IRA impacts and that's still not completely waned, but what we saw in Q3 was pretty strong bookings activity. So as we look to Q4 and into 2025, I think we're cautiously optimistic about seeing a return to growth there. So I'd really just characterize Q3 as in line with expectations and part and parcel of the lumpiness you see in this business. You also mentioned Helios, I think it's just worth mentioning that we were very happy to see that development, but still very early days in terms of how that's going to ramp up and play out and too soon to say where that's concerned. There's certainly no impact in the remainder of 2024 and unlikely in 2025 as well.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Rachel, this is Bob. Just to add-on a little more to answer your last part of your question in terms of the sequential step-up where we had talked -- as Simon and Padraig had said, we've done a little better actually in Q3 than we expected and we're expecting a roughly $20 million step-up from Q3 to Q4. Those orders are all in-house and we're still on-track for the long -- the full-year estimate for NASD and that's incorporated into our guidance.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. That's helpful. Then for my follow-up, I just wanted to dig a little bit more into 4Q guidance and what that means in terms of an exit-rate into 2025. So appreciate some of your comments earlier, you highlighted in Matt's question that you're not really assuming a budget flush for your fiscal year end in October. But I guess, how should investors look at this 4Q number on an organic growth basis of that down 2% to up 1% on the range. And how do we look at that translating into 2025? If I look at consensus right now, consensus is just shy of 5% organic on 2025, Street is also nearing that double digit EPS growth. So I appreciate it's still a little bit early for you guys to formally give us 2025 expectation, but what do you think about exit rate and where sell-side numbers are right now?\nBob McMahon: Yes, you were reading my mind, Rachel. This is Bob and it is a little too early to talk about FY 2025. But I think what it does show is our expectation of this continued steady improvement. We improved here in Q3, 300 basis-points sequentially. We're expecting another improvement here going into Q4. And I would expect that improvement to continue into FY 2025. So -- and we do expect -- while it's too early to give you a specific number, we do expect to grow next year. These markets will return and we've been below the long-term trend, but there's nothing to suggest that the or the long-term growth rates of these markets, there's nothing to suggest that these markets have changed and so we're optimistic about continued recovery going into FY 2025.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Bob, maybe one for me, just on China, how you guys are thinking about the region there? It sounds like it was down 11%, that got a little bit better on the revenue side sequentially. It sounds like again, lab activity maybe look a little bit better. Could you just talk about expectations into year-end? Some of your peers have suggested you could see a bit of a pause on the capital side into calendar year-end as we wait for a little clarity on the stimulus. Just how you guys are thinking about China, again, not only into your fiscal year, but just into the year-end on the calendar side and what's your view in terms of do we see a little bit of an air pocket here until the good news dollars get firmed up?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, Patrick. It's a great question and we had actually seen a little of that in our Q2 of last -- just a quarter ago here really on the bid activity, primarily for instrumentation. We are optimistic about the mid-term here in terms of the stimulus. That's probably more FY 2025 event probably. But what we are seeing is more activity there and I think what's encouraging and maybe I can turn it over to Angelica as well, our services business has seen an increase in a pickup in activity and certainly we saw consumables as well. So it still dampened demand and we did see that impact in Academia & Government, that was the biggest impact in China, but we are seeing some pockets of green shoot in terms of recovery.\nAngelica Riemann: Yes, Bob, I'll just add. In China, we are encouraged from a services perspective on the nice sequential growth that we saw from Q2 to Q3, which is indicative of continued and somewhat increasing lab activity in China.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That sounds encouraging. And then maybe another one for you, Bob. Just as we think about the margin construct as we work our way into year end and into 2025, maybe just remind us some of the moving pieces to think about high-level as we look ahead to next year, obviously, the cost out program seems to be progressing well to your point, the margins came in nicely here in 3Q. But yeah, maybe just the moving pieces as we go ahead to next year without talking too much about the top line, obviously, the volume matters there. But just kind of down the P&L, how to think about some of the margin algo for next year would be helpful.\nBob McMahon: Yes, I think as we talked about, Patrick, it's a great question and we're committed to continuing to drive efficiencies across all of the P&L line items and I think you've seen that across the actions that we've taken. We're on track to delivering that $100 million of incremental annualized savings by the end of 2024. So there will still be a tailwind, obviously going into 2025 for that benefit. Offsetting that will be some resets of our variable pay and activities like that, but we are committed to covering that. If I think about it at the highest level, what I would expect us to continue to be able to do is drive leveraged earnings next year. And I think you're seeing that the scale benefit that we're seeing in certainly our ACG business here this last quarter, just phenomenal profit contribution and I think with volume coming back into the instrument business as well, that will set us up nicely for next year. So think about a nice incremental tailwind associated with the continued actions or the annualization of that actions that come in FY 2025, partially offset by merit in some of the activities and then we'll have our ongoing productivity measures and some -- we'll actually share some of the more detail around this probably in our Analyst Day in December. So stay-tuned on that as well.\nPatrick Donnelly: Thanks. Okay. That's great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to dig into some of these instrument trends a little bit more. I was wondering, if you could talk about just what you're seeing across some of the big categories like LC, LCMS, GC, spectroscopy, any color on how those performed?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I mean in general terms, Jack, I think you know the customers are very, very cautious. But what I will say is that lab manager remain very engaged with our sales teams about future projects, that is true. We see a lot of stability in that. So it's still very challenged and I would say that, you know our deal close rate is still elevated, but our funnels are very stable with low cancellations. So I think that goes across most of the markets. And as you see going-forward, you know our results in CST and services growing mid-single digits and bodes very, very well in terms of lab activity increasing. So we're seeing slow, but steady improvement.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Jack, just to follow-on to that. I think one of the things as we mentioned in the call, the book-to-bill being at one for instruments is a positive sign. It was slightly better than what we expected. Overall, LSAG instruments were down low-double-digit.\nJack Meehan: Yes. Yeah. Were all the categories kind of right around there?\nPadraig McDonnell: I would say if you looked at the LC and LCMS business, they were in the mid-teens, our spectroscopy business better than that.\nJack Meehan: Okay. And then just as one end-market follow-up, I was curious in CAM in the third quarter, so it was down 5%, it was a little bit below what I was thinking. Is there anything just within the different categories within that end-market that softened a little bit relative to what you were thinking a few months ago?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, you're correct, it was declined by 5% and it was really due to the impact of overproduction in China, which negatively impacted market investments globally. But we did see increases in service and consumables, both combined at 7% increase, but there was a decrease of about 14% in instruments and I think CapEx spending remains slightly challenged there.\nJack Meehan: Yes. That makes sense. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One, I guess, Padraig or Bob, if you look at the guidance change over the last three months, NASD, China, biopharma, those have been the big categories, right? I think the guide assumes NASD doubled -- down double digits in fiscal 2024, China down high singles, double-digits, biopharma down, which of these is expected to get better next year? What is getting better or worse? And is there a first-half versus second-half dynamic that we should be aware of?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, Vijay, thanks for the question. I think in terms of what we expect getting better, we expect all of them to improve next year. We raised the midpoint of guidance, $15 million on revenue and $0.03 in EPS and we see across all those areas, markets improving slowly and that's reflected in the sequential increase that we're guiding in Q4. So while we had a kind of a solid Q3, the end market environment for capital remains constrained and visibility while improving is still difficult.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And maybe on that Q4 commentary for guidance implies I think up 6% or 7%, which seems generally in line with your historical sequential step-up from 3Q. And is the bookings trends that we saw and NASE trends we saw, does it support that historical, I guess, seasonality because I think where the Street is debating upon is that historical seasonality, does it bake in some year-end budget flush or what is baked into that sequential step-up?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So I think what we're seeing is that it's -- we normally see the step-up, that's what we're expecting this time. We're not including the budget flush in that. If we see a budget flush, it's on top and that will be in our Q1 numbers as we go forward.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Vijay, this is Bob and just to build-on what Padraig is saying, I mean you're absolutely right. When we look at the sequential, it is in-line with our historical in our order book based on what we've seen today. Obviously, we have to book orders in Q4, but our order book trends would support that.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, guys. Question on BIOVECTRA and maybe just synergies with the rest of the NASD business. How do you think about -- does that change views on capacity? And maybe just talk a little bit about how much of their BIOVECTRA business is clinical versus commercial and any kind of emerging modalities that you're adding here?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I'll start, Tycho and I'll bring in Simon in a minute. So we are absolutely delighted with BIOVECTRA. We think it's a great asset that enhances our offerings and it really allows us to deepen our relationships with our key pharma customers. And what we're really excited about is that it builds on our capabilities on the current NASD modalities around anti-sense and particularly gene editing with microbial fermentation and ADC capability. And so we're very happy with that. So there's a lot of synergies as we bring that forward. So I'll hand over to Simon to talk maybe about capacity in the main business.\nSimon May: Yes, I think Padraig hit many of the high notes already in terms of the synergies. We already mentioned the complete solution offering in gene editing, which we see as a really significant competitive advantage going forward. Sterile fill finish is another synergy that we're excited about. We've had a lot of request from our customers over the past few years for that capability. And from the diligence we've done with BIOVECTRA, we think they've got truly world-class capabilities there. And as Padraig also mentioned with microbial fermentation, high potency APIs, there's an existing footprint there in GLP-1 manufacturing. So I think we've got a slightly higher clinical mix in BIOVECTRA than we have in NASD. So I think we're just killing several birds with one stone with this acquisition. From a capacity perspective, I'd say BIOVECTRA has been ahead of the curve with capacity CapEx and we've got some skin to grow into there over the next few years\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-up on China. You had the pull-forward dynamic in the first quarter, $15 million. If that were back in 2Q, I think you were effectively flat, maybe down a little bit. First, is that the right assumption? What are you actually embedding in 4Q for China in guidance? And then how do you think about the return to growth in 2025? Could you see that in the first half of the year?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Hey, Tycho, that's -- your recollection is correct. And as we think about implied fourth quarter down mid-single digits in China, we're going up quite honestly against some easier compares in-full disclosure. And we would expect a slight sequential step-up from a revenue perspective as well. And so that reflects this steady improvement. We do expect, again, not a lot of that stimulus to come in our Q4, basically none, but more into Q5, but the bidding activity that we're seeing has ramped-up. And then I think the activity that we're seeing in services and consumables, we're expecting that to continue. It's probably too early to tell next year for China, but I would expect it to continue to improve and not be down the way it is. We're expecting a low double-digit decline this year, we would expect to improve from that and it will probably be improvement throughout the year as opposed to an immediate improvement. Certainly, the stimulus will help us with that. But again, that will be in our first and second quarters most likely, but we're not expecting a huge step-up right there. It will be overtime because this stimulus is over a three-year period.\nTycho Peterson: Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Instrumentation growth, obviously, an important question. You know, last quarter, you lowered expectations meaningfully, but again, book-to-bill was a strong more than one. Again, this quarter it is more than one and I think you said that, that last quarter was the first time you saw growth in the market after seven quarters. So that looks like it's continued again into the quarter. So just maybe help us understand instrument where we sit on instrumentation and what sort of recovery are you seeing here in August and what gives you sort of confidence that the instrumentation should bounce -- continue to bounce back into 2025 as well?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, look at the indications from the team, we have a strategic account team that does a lot of citations with our major accounts. There's -- we're seeing that more positive than negative in terms of customer sentiment, which is a very good sign. We see a lot of activity in our testing labs, as well as focusing on PFAS and so on. So there is drivers within the markets that are positive. But overall, I would say it's slow and steady and we're trading it as that. And the teams have really good visibility. Our commercial teams, which we've transformed in the last few years are really, really close to our customers. We have really good visibility into that. So it's slow, but steady. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob, to that?\nBob McMahon: Yes. No, I think you're spot-on and we're not building any budget flush into our Q4, Puneet. So if that does in fact happen, that would be a benefit to our current estimate.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Thanks. And then recent drug pricing negotiation with Medicare on the first drugs are out. Obviously, IRA is having an impact, but over the next three years annually, 15 drugs will be negotiated and that probably leads to another set of impacts. So what are you hearing from your large pharma customers and overall, how are they thinking about the R&D spend and the spend that they're -- that they currently have on Agilent?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I think in general, they're very cautious, of course, with some of the impacts, the macro impacts that are facing. They're not -- there's a lot of M&A activity going on within pharma, a lot of consolidation, which of course takes time and energy for these companies to focus on. And I think what you're going to see overtime is it probably even out in terms of impact. What isn't going down, by the way, is the number of R&D programs. We see that increasing in a number of key modality areas, particularly around GLP-1, etc. So we need to wait and see, but having said that, people kind of forget in the last few years the enormous amount of spend that has happened and we're seeing that normalize now, of course in the installed-base and coming out of that in 2025.\nPuneet Souda: Okay, fair. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to follow-up on maybe this is what Puneet was just getting at, but you called out in your prepared remarks a couple of times that with biopharma, small molecule held up a little bit better or small molecule did a little bit better than large molecule, I assume. Just wondering if you could delve into that a little bit more, was that a particular instrument class or modality that drove that? Was that -- does that have to do with budget cycles, just what you're seeing there and why there's such a difference in molecule type?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Mike, this is Bob. You're right, I mean, our small molecule business was down mid-single digits in the quarter, which was better-than-expected actually. And then in Europe, it grew, which was a very positive sign. And this does speak to -- you can only hold-on to your old instruments for so long before the replacements need to happen. We're not calling replacement cycle inflection just yet, but every quarter these instruments get older. And one of the things that I think is important here is, pill counts and volumes continue to grow. And back to the question around the IRA and the pricing, I think it was generally, you know, not the worst case scenario, maybe a little better than people expected. And where our strength is, is in the development moving into production and that continues to be long-term positive trend. So that would be our core LC franchise and then the biopharma, some of that was impacted by our NASD business, which was kind of the air pocket. Actually, if you take our biopharma business, which was down double digits and you take NASD out, we are at mid-single digits as well. Not as -- it was down a little more than small molecule, but generally still in that same range. So both of them are actually when you take out the kind of the one-time unique aspect of NASD performing better quarter-on-quarter, which is a positive sign.\nPadraig McDonnell: So I would say, just adding to that, Bob, we saw services growing double-digits in biopharma and mid-single digits in small molecules. So that's a big component of what we see in those different modalities.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. Both of those answers really helpful. And then for my follow-up, I want to lean in a little bit more on BIOVECTRA. I mean, everything you kind of laid out there for the rationale and the financials of the deal certainly makes sense. But I'm just curious, you know, you've had a presence in some CDMO type capabilities in the past. Just wondering how hard are you going to lean into this? And what I'm alluding to is obviously, one of your large traditional tools vendors has a CDMO business has been in that business for a number of years now and there's a lot of talk of the benefits of having both the instrument, the consumables and the services business on the tail-end. Is this something you're going to continue to grow overtime? Is it BIOVECTRA like a beachhead acquisition? I mean we should expect more investment down the road?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I'll start and then maybe hand it over to Simon. When we look at our M&A ambition, first of all, we're -- it's going to be -- it's going to be really centered around where our strategy is, what's the strategic fit in faster-growing markets and of course, value creation. BIOVECTRA takes all of those boxes and it's an area of where we're building out more capabilities for customers. So we see that continuing. And so we're really excited about it, but we do see that this business has a lot of runway. It's a business that's growing well, very well-run, of course and has had a lot of capital investment over a number of years. And I think this is only the start of our ambition in continuing to grow BIOVECTRA and NASD. But Simon?\nSimon May: Not much to add really, only beyond that, we've got a very strong existing position in the RNA modality. I'd say up until this point, it's been a relatively narrow capability position and BIOVECTRA builds on that quite nicely as we look at future optionality around complementary capabilities and modalities, we think it's a rich space and that's probably all we can say at this point.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just back to China, the down 11% was a bit better than we were looking for. Can you just unpack what specifically got better in the quarter given the guidance cut that you made last quarter, maybe either by customer type or by product type? And then just to clear up, like so your guidance for China, I know it was down double digit. Has that changed at all? Have you improved that? So that's my first question.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Dan. Thanks for the question. China is still in line with our full-year end guidance down low-double-digits. If I look at where we actually performed slightly better than what we anticipated, it was actually in pharma and it gets back to what we were talking about before, the activity both on the services side performing sequentially better, as well as our consumables business actually growing. And so we were down you know close to 30% in Q2 of last year, we were down low double-digits in pharma year-on-year. And so that was the big sequential improvement in Q3 and I would expect that to continue into Q4.\nDan Brennan: Okay. Thanks, Bob. And then sorry to go back to NASD, but there's just been a lot of questions from investors after the turn of events year-to-date in terms of that business really slowing a lot. Can you -- did you say what it did actually in the quarter? I didn't hear the number kind of year-over-year, what did NSD do in the quarter and then kind of if we take your guidance full-year, I know you said step-up, could you just give us some clarity on the quarter? And then any additional color on clinical versus commercial? It sounds like your bookings are improving, so that portends well for the outlook, but just trying to unpack like what's going on right now in the quarter? Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Dan. What I would say is, we typically don't give a specific number for NASD, but it actually performed in line or slightly better than what we expected. So we had been signaling a step down in Q3 and we actually did better than what we were expecting there. The full-year is still in line with where we were, which is roughly a $300 million business. As Simon was saying, the bookings continue to be positive in terms of activity and we're starting to see some of our customers, the readouts of some of the activities, which is more a harbinger of long-term opportunity versus short-term. But you know, if anything, it was a little better than we expected. So I don't want anyone to takeaway that it wasn't -- even though it was down in the quarter, we expected that and communicated that as part of our guidance and we're still on-track for the full-year estimate that we had coming into the quarter.\nDan Brennan: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey, guys, thanks for the questions. Maybe first, just could you talk about growth rates by segment for the fiscal fourth quarter and maybe your assumptions for instrumentation versus consumables and services in the fourth quarter?\nPadraig McDonnell: Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes, I'll -- hey, Catherine, it's Bob. What I would say is, if I look at our Q4, all groups, we would expect to do better and if I went by group, LSAG would be -- we're expecting kind of low single digits off of a down 7% this year. Consumables being better than that overall and with the instrument side, still probably down slightly or would be down slightly. DGD down mid-single digits and ACG up mid-single digits towards the high-end. That's what we've embedded in our guidance. So all three of those actually performing better than where we were in Q3.\nCatherine Schulte: Yes, perfect. And then maybe going back to Small Molecule, nice to see the improvement there. I think what was just Small Molecule performance excluding China? I know you said Europe grew, but just curious to get more color on what you're seeing elsewhere?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I think what we're seeing is Europe was a standout in Small Molecule, a lot of activity there, but probably stable across the different markets on us. And what we did see from the Small Molecule side, we did see pretty good growth in services that as well as has had that number, but I think overall Europe ahead, but everywhere else stable.\nBob McMahon: Yes. What -- and so we were down mid-single digits and as Padraig said, if you took China out, we were down low-single digits everywhere else.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Waldman: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for you. Padraig or Bob, maybe first a follow-up. On your assumption for no budget flushing impact on pharma instrumentation, is that just a function of the timing of your quarter relative to calendar year-end buying from these customers? Or are there other things you're seeing that are leaving you on the sidelines as it relates to end of your pharma spending? And then a related question was, curious any high-level thoughts you had on 2025 based on planning conversations you're having with pharma accounts, are you thinking next year should be a return to normal growth type year in pharma instrument budget as budgets are reset or is it more of a gradual recovery or return to normal over a couple of year period. Any feedback you're getting from accounts on that?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I'll take the first one and maybe hand-off to Bob for the second one. I think it's a year ago and we were -- people were talking about budget flushes. We didn't expect it and we didn't see it. We saw a little bit, but not much. We're expecting the same this time, of course, our year-end at the end of October. So if we do see any activity will be in Q1 2025. Why do we see this is because we're very close to our customers. We know exactly when, where the funnel is, where the deals are and where installed base, we have a lot of installed base information. So we're not expecting it anything substantial at the end-of-the year. But what we are seeing is a lot more conversations about next year, slow, steady recovery and we're hearing that across the board. I don't know if you want to take the second question, Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Josh, on 2025 as we were saying, it's probably too early to say. But what I -- our current indication is that it's not going to snap back November 1st to be back to normal. I do think that you'll continue to see a recovery throughout FY 2025 and get back to that long-term growth rate sometime in 2025, that's the way we kind of think about it. But I don't think it's another two to three year estimate either or based on our conversations with our customers right now. So it's probably in between.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Okay. And then just had a follow-up on ACG. I was curious if you could provide a bit more context on the dynamics you're seeing there, especially interested in what you're seeing from an RFP and win rate dynamic in the contracted business? And then you mentioned, I think in the slide decks, benefiting from mix. I was wondering if you could flush that out a bit?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I'll take the first part of that question and hand it over to Angelica. Extremely pleased with ACG's performance and that's years of investment in a broad product offerings in key markets, that are really being received by customers in this environment where they want to get more productivity out of their systems, they want to use their assets in different ways. And we've seen the flow through to our results in spite of the CapEx challenges all year. So the business performs extremely well and the margins are extremely good. So I'll ask Angelica to provide more color on the contract business. But I think what's really interesting is our enterprise service business as well. Angelica?\nAngelica Riemann: Yes, so to really dive in on the contracts, right? It's nearly 70% of our business in Q3 and it's continuing to grow double-digit. As we continue to see that strong demand in our enterprise service offerings, which are in the high -- the mid-teens, it's really about being there to help customers optimize their lab operations, improve their productivity and our offers really facilitate our customers improving the lab operations, the efficiencies and the waste reduction. So we're continuing to see some very strong and sticky behavior within our contracts franchise.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And Josh, just on the comment on mix is, when we have business on-contract, that generally is good for us and good for our customers as well.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Okay. Appreciate all the detail.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I know it's late in the call, that being said, I got three lightning round questions, which I'm going to rattle through and then listen to the answers. The first is on math. If recurring revenue growth was up mid-single digits in the quarter, it seems like instruments has to be down around 20%, maybe more based on the numbers you reported in the 10-Q in Q3 of last year. Bob, I think you said in response to Matt Sykes' question, it was down low-double digits. What are we missing? Just not trying to be too picky here, but it just seems important in the context of assessing trends and what way to put on your book-to-bill commentary. So that's the first question. The second is on China stimulus. Any change in dynamics regarding stalling either in terms of conversions or even cancellations? There's some skeletal that that there's been some recent changes as the shape of stimulus becomes a bit more clear? And then the third question is on 2025. If you exit 2024 with flattish core growth in Q4, that would obviously be a positive trend relative to what we've seen over the last few quarters. That said, it would seem like if you draw a straight line that you'd be on track to exit 2025 at around, call it 5%, maybe 6% growth rather than growing mid-single digits for the year. So I think you need a fundamental improvement in overall market conditions and/or a real impact from China stimulus to get to mid-singles for the year. I just want to see if any of my logic is flawed there? Thank you and have a good night.\nPadraig McDonnell: That's certainly a lightning round, Doug, but we'll try and we'll answer it. I think, Bob, you can take the first and the last one, I'll take China.\nBob McMahon: Yes. The comment that I had on Instruments was specifically related to LSAG instruments and they were down low double-digit. Consumables was up mid-single digits for the total being down minus 7%. So that is. We do have some instrumentation in DGG as well that was down roughly the same as where LSAG was. So down 20% is way too negative. I'll turn it over to Padraig for the second one and then I can jump back into last one.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I think, we're very close to our China team and the local team has seen an increased activity. We're seeing that improve from last quarter and for clarity, of course, we're not building any benefit from the stimulus into our Q4 guide. But what we're seeing is, we're seeing in early days, what we're hearing that the stimulus is broader in terms of its reach over a three-year period. Having said that, we are hearing that the first tranche will likely be focused on Academic & Government accounts. But again, it's early days, as it trickles down through provinces, as the mechanism of the funding goes, we'll be sure to update as we know that.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And I think just the last one real quick. It's too early. We're not going to get into what we're looking at for FY 2025 other than to say that we expect improvement throughout the year.\nOperator: And I'll now turn the call back over to Parmeet Ahuja for any closing remarks.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Regina and thanks everyone for joining the call today. With that, we'd like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja, to begin. Please go ahead.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Phil Binns, President of the Agilent Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group; Simon May, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Angelica Riemann, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our third quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion, along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rate. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure related to the move of our Cell Analysis business from LSAG into DGG. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risk and other factors. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Thanks, Parmeet. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. The Agilent team executed well in the third quarter and posted solid results, delivering better-than-expected revenue and earnings. Revenue of $1.578 billion, declined 4.4%, an improvement of 300 basis points from Q2, reflecting the steady improvement in the market. Operating margin of 27.4% improved sequentially, as the actions we announced last quarter start to deliver. And we remain on-track to deliver the incremental annualized savings of $100 million by the end of the fiscal year. Earnings per share of $1.32 is $0.04 above the high end of guidance. As a result of our strong Q3 performance, we are raising our guidance at the midpoint for both revenue and EPS and we continue to make investments in our most promising growth opportunities that I referenced in our Q2 call. We are investing in our digital ecosystem to further enhance our differentiated customer experience, plus we are mobilizing the organization to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives, driving margin expansion and growth and increasing our execution capabilities. Separately in the quarter, we were excited to announce two acquisitions that demonstrate our focus on biopharma and our digital ecosystem, which I'll talk about in a moment. As you know well, the pace of change is faster than ever. Our markets, customers and competitors are not standing still, neither are we. We are accelerating our pace of innovation and execution, so we can add to and capitalize on opportunities in front of us. We are sharply focused on key growth vectors, including biopharma, PFAS and Advanced Materials. I continue to meet and connect with employees, customers and shareholders around the globe to listen to their perspectives on how we should build on our strengths and move Agilent forward. The entire Agilent team is clear on what is vital to the company's future, becoming even more customer focused and even more nimble to continue to win in the marketplace and add value to customers and shareholders. We are evolving our strategy, adapting quickly to market trends and changes, while accelerating our pace of innovation in areas of greatest return for long-term growth. We're excited to announce that you'll hear more about these topics and our transformation at our Investor Day we have planned in New York on December 17th. Now, let's talk further about our Q3 results. All our end markets except academia and government, which is our smallest, ended the quarter better-than-expected. Our largest market pharma declined high-single-digits, slightly better than our expectations and while biopharma continues to be pressured, we are seeing relatively better performance in small molecule. Our leadership in providing workflow solutions for PFAS continued to show strong performance in the environmental markets. Geographically, Europe exceeded expectations led by small-molecule pharma, as well as continued strength in environmental. Our other regions performed roughly in-line with expectations. While capital equipment budgets remain constrained, we continue to see good lab activity in Q3 with services plus consumables growing mid-single digits. When looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $782 million in revenue, down 7%, while the instrument side of the business remains constrained, it was encouraging that our instrument book-to-bill was again greater than one. The group saw a decline across all regions and most end-markets with low single-digit growth in Environmental & Forensics. The Consumables continue to be a bright spot, growing by mid-single digit. The LSAG team also was busy innovating with the introduction of the 8850 GC that helps customers reach their sustainability goals by delivering answers efficiently, while using up to 30% less power than other GC's and has a much smaller footprint. Moving on to the Agilent CrossLab Group, the business delivered revenue of $411 million for the quarter, up mid-single digit. ACG grew in every region except China, where we were down modestly year-on-year, but showed meaningful improvement versus last quarter. Once again, we drove double-digit growth in service contracts, which represented nearly 70% of the total business. And beyond another quarter of solid revenue growth, ACG also delivered a record operating margin of 34%, demonstrating that the resiliency and strength of the recurring revenue business continues despite the constrained capital equipment environment. The continued strength of our business is a testament to our strategy of increasing the connect rates on our instruments and the ongoing value we are providing to our customers in helping them reach their productivity goals. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $385 million in revenue, representing an 8% decline. Pathology grew mid-single digits globally and was offset by declines in Cell Analysis, NASD and genomics. NASD stepped down sequentially in Q3 as expected and we are on track for NASD's revenues to step-up sequentially in Q4. In the face of a constrained CapEx environment, the Agilent team has remained consistent in putting our customers first and fostering deeper relationships with them. We continue to execute well and be disciplined, while investing in high-growth opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to announce two acquisitions, that speak to our focus on biopharma and increasing recurring revenue, as well as on strengthening the digital ecosystem for Agilent customers. In late July, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire BIOVECTRA, a leading specialized contract development and manufacturing organization. The Canada-based company builds on Agilent's capabilities in oligonucleotides and CRISPR therapeutics by expanding our portfolio of services. BIOVECTRA adds rapidly growing modalities in microbial fermentation, antibody-drug conjugates and high-potency active pharmaceutical ingredients. It also brings world-class capabilities that when combined with NASD enables us to deliver customers a complete gene editing solution. The company delivered more than $110 million in revenue during the calendar year 2023 and expects double-digit revenue growth this year. The BIOVECTRA acquisition remains on-track to be closed by the end of the year and we're looking-forward to welcoming the BIOVECTRA team to Agilent. At the end of the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of California-based Sigsense, a start-up that uses artificial intelligence and power monitoring to help customers optimize their lab operations. Sigsense Technology already is available to our customers through CrossLab Connect, a suite of digital applications that improve lab performance. A hearty welcome to the Sigsense team who already is part of Agilent. During the quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which showcases a large and growing portfolio of products that help our customers reach their sustainability goals. Instruments certified with the My GreenLab ACT label now accounts for 40% of all instrument revenue and we continue to regularly release products like the new 8850 GC with environmental benefits. We are also proud that we have recently ranked in the top 20 of Time Magazine's 500 Most Sustainable companies in the world. Bob will now provide the details on our results, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Thanks, Padraig and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full-year and fourth quarter guidance. Q3 revenue was $1.578 billion, a decline of 4.4% core, but a 300 basis-point sequential improvement as Padraig noted. Excluding China, revenue declined low-single digits in the quarter. On a reported basis, currency had a negative impact of 1.1 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 10 basis points, resulting in a reported decline of 5.6%. Our largest end market pharma declined 8%. Biopharma was down low double-digits or down mid-single digits, excluding NASD. Small molecule performed better, down mid-single digits and was led by growth in Europe. Services and pharma continues to perform well, growing high single-digit. In Chemical & Advanced Materials, revenue declined 5%, with growth in Americas offset by softness in China. Our Advanced Materials sub-segment performed better, driven by our business in the semiconductor market. Academia and government, our smallest market, can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We saw a decline of 11% as Europe and China both saw double-digit declines, partially offset by better performance in the Americas region. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical end-market grew 2%, including continued mid-single digit growth in pathology, offset by ongoing softness in genomics. In Environmental & Forensics, we grew 4%, another great quarter for our PFAS testing business. We saw robust business in Europe, led by the new EU Water Directive and in China due to the nationwide emerging pollutants program. Now wrapping up our end-markets, food was down 3% versus last year, but grew sequentially and was led by Asia, ex-China. Moving on to our regional performance, Europe was flat overall, beating our expectations, while we declined 6% in the Americas and declined 1% in Asia, ex-China. China revenue declined 11% with quarterly revenue improving sequentially, driven by growth in services and consumables. This speaks to some increase in lab activity, which is encouraging. Now, let's move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 56.0% in the quarter, down slightly versus a year-ago, but up 40 basis points sequentially. Our operating margin of 27.4% improved sequentially and was better-than-expected. Despite the dampened demand, we continue to make good progress in driving our productivity initiatives and continuing to manage the cost structure very well, while investing for growth. As Padraig mentioned, we are on track to deliver the $100 million in incremental annualized cost-savings by the end of the fiscal year. Below the line, our net interest income was in line as was our tax rate of 13% and we had $291 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.32. That was ahead of our expectations, but down 7.7% from a year ago as we went up against a difficult compare due to the variable pay reset in Q3 of last year. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $452 million in the quarter and we invested $92 million in capital expenditures. As we committed in Q2, we ramped-up our share repurchases starting here in Q3. We purchased $585 million in shares and paid out $68 million through dividends, for a total of $653 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. This includes $500 million of the previously announced $750 million opportunistic share repurchase and we expect to complete the additional $250 million repurchase in Q4. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of $0.6 and even with the upcoming BIOVECTRA acquisition, our balance sheet and leverage ratios will still be in a very strong position. In summary, we performed well and continue to see a steady improvement in the market and expect that to continue into FY 2025. Because of our Q3 results, we are increasing the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $6.450 billion to $6.500 billion. This represents a decline of 5.6% to 4.9% on a reported basis and a decline of 5.0% to 4.3% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 60 basis points. Full-year non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $5.21 and $5.25, representing a decline of 4.2% to 3.5%. This assumes net interest income of $38 million, a 13% tax rate and $292 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We have not included any impact of the BIOVECTRA acquisition in our updated guidance and $0.06 does not have a material financial impact to the year or Q4. This full-year guidance translates into Q4 revenue in the range of $1.641 billion to $1.691 billion. This represents a decline of 1.9% to 1.1% growth on a core basis and a decline of 2.8% to 0.2% growth on a reported basis. Currency and M&A are a combined headwind of 90 basis-points. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.38 and $1.42, marking a return to growth at the midpoint. We expect a 13% tax rate, a decrease in net interest income to $5 million due to the lower cash balance and $287 million diluted shares outstanding for the quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Padraig for some closing comments. Padraig?\nPadraig McDonnell: These are exciting times at Agilent, with a team that is second to known, we are doubling down on our customer force culture and deepening our relationships to further enhance our market leading customer experience that is already the best in the industry. We are evolving our strategy to aggressively pursue our ambition to grow in markets where we have a right to win through both organic and inorganic growth and we will continue to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives. We remain a leader across key platforms and we're in great long-term growth markets that are beginning to show evidence of recovery. And best of all, our team is engaged, leading to Newsweek including Agilent on its America's Greatest Workplaces 2024 list. Again, thank you for joining today's call. I'm energized by how we are evolving Agilent. Each data team gains momentum in building an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers and creates value for our shareholders. We are fueled by the future possibilities and I look forward to continuing to share our progress. Parmeet, over to you for Q&A.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, just digging in a little bit on the LSAG where you had a pretty solid beat. It looks like that was driven primarily by consumables and services. So, I'm curious if you can give any more color on what instruments did? I know you had a book-to-bill above one, but just how does that inform your view as we go into 2025 on the replacement cycle, specifically large biopharma demand and how that might impact your view on when that replacement cycle starts kicking-in?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks a lot, Matt, maybe I'll kick it off and give it to Bob. I think, first of all, you're correct, we saw very, very promising growth in both Consumables & Services, which shows lab activity is actually improving or is very stable. We're still very challenged on the instrument side, but what we're seeing is, we're seeing a lot of activity around conversations with lab managers. Our funnel is extremely stable. We haven't seen any -- any cancellations. But what I would say is that, deal closure times are still elevated. So we're not at this point seeing any budget towards the end of the year and which of course for us ends at the end of October, but we're watching that closely. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Thanks, Matt, for that question and maybe just to fill in and add some additional commentary to what Padraig was saying. When we looked at the quarter, we were very pleased actually both our Consumables business, as well as our Instrument business performed better-than-expected in the quarter. We were down 7% in total. Our Consumables business was actually up mid-single digits towards the high-end there. And our Instruments business was down low-double-digits, but that was better than what we expected. And as Padraig mentioned, we had a book-to-bill that was greater than one on the instrument side again this quarter, which was very encouraging.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. Thanks for that. Very helpful. And then just on Academic & Government, I know you've talked about it and you've talked about it for a while, how volatile that can be, but just given sort of the two quarters in a row of sort of negative performance there and you called out Europe and China specifically. Are there any kind of durable trends you're seeing either in funding or in demand that you think might be more persistent in that specific end-market as we go through Q4 and then as we look into 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: No, I think, look, we saw a decline of about 11% and that was really against the comparative feature, the stimulus in EMEA and strong results in APAC and China. And so it was a really tough compare. And I think what we're seeing is funding remains stable in most regions and except I would say Europe where we're seeing a reallocation of funding towards defense, but I would say no major changes in that market.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions you guys. I wanted to dig into NASD a little bit. Obviously, we had some positive announcements intra quarter with the Helios-B readout. You mentioned that NASD stepped down sequentially as expected and then you said you're expecting that to then step up into fiscal 4Q. So could you unpack all that for us a little bit? How should we think about the magnitude of the step-up into 4Q? And then given some of the updated data readouts that we got intra quarter, how does that underpin your assumptions on NASD next year and then also long-term?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I'll start off and maybe I'll hand it over to Simon, who is on the call here as well. We've seen, with clinical batches, of course, there can be changes with customers progress in those batches. We're not seeing any changes in what we're saying for Q4, so we're fairly certain of Q4 on that. What we're seeing as well is that we've grown our clinical business over 50% this year, which is very promising. The long range view of the market is very strong with the drugs and the modalities that are being used. But I think what you're seeing is a normal kind of up and down between quarters with that business. But I don't know if you want to add any more color, Simon?\nSimon May: Yes, I'd just echo what Padraig said, I think the Q3 performance that we saw in NASD was largely in line with expectations. And in that business, we always see a natural lag between order booking activity and revenue recognition because of the length of time that these programs take. And towards the end of last year, we were really seeing the effects of the IRA impacts and that's still not completely waned, but what we saw in Q3 was pretty strong bookings activity. So as we look to Q4 and into 2025, I think we're cautiously optimistic about seeing a return to growth there. So I'd really just characterize Q3 as in line with expectations and part and parcel of the lumpiness you see in this business. You also mentioned Helios, I think it's just worth mentioning that we were very happy to see that development, but still very early days in terms of how that's going to ramp up and play out and too soon to say where that's concerned. There's certainly no impact in the remainder of 2024 and unlikely in 2025 as well.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Rachel, this is Bob. Just to add-on a little more to answer your last part of your question in terms of the sequential step-up where we had talked -- as Simon and Padraig had said, we've done a little better actually in Q3 than we expected and we're expecting a roughly $20 million step-up from Q3 to Q4. Those orders are all in-house and we're still on-track for the long -- the full-year estimate for NASD and that's incorporated into our guidance.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. That's helpful. Then for my follow-up, I just wanted to dig a little bit more into 4Q guidance and what that means in terms of an exit-rate into 2025. So appreciate some of your comments earlier, you highlighted in Matt's question that you're not really assuming a budget flush for your fiscal year end in October. But I guess, how should investors look at this 4Q number on an organic growth basis of that down 2% to up 1% on the range. And how do we look at that translating into 2025? If I look at consensus right now, consensus is just shy of 5% organic on 2025, Street is also nearing that double digit EPS growth. So I appreciate it's still a little bit early for you guys to formally give us 2025 expectation, but what do you think about exit rate and where sell-side numbers are right now?\nBob McMahon: Yes, you were reading my mind, Rachel. This is Bob and it is a little too early to talk about FY 2025. But I think what it does show is our expectation of this continued steady improvement. We improved here in Q3, 300 basis-points sequentially. We're expecting another improvement here going into Q4. And I would expect that improvement to continue into FY 2025. So -- and we do expect -- while it's too early to give you a specific number, we do expect to grow next year. These markets will return and we've been below the long-term trend, but there's nothing to suggest that the or the long-term growth rates of these markets, there's nothing to suggest that these markets have changed and so we're optimistic about continued recovery going into FY 2025.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Bob, maybe one for me, just on China, how you guys are thinking about the region there? It sounds like it was down 11%, that got a little bit better on the revenue side sequentially. It sounds like again, lab activity maybe look a little bit better. Could you just talk about expectations into year-end? Some of your peers have suggested you could see a bit of a pause on the capital side into calendar year-end as we wait for a little clarity on the stimulus. Just how you guys are thinking about China, again, not only into your fiscal year, but just into the year-end on the calendar side and what's your view in terms of do we see a little bit of an air pocket here until the good news dollars get firmed up?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, Patrick. It's a great question and we had actually seen a little of that in our Q2 of last -- just a quarter ago here really on the bid activity, primarily for instrumentation. We are optimistic about the mid-term here in terms of the stimulus. That's probably more FY 2025 event probably. But what we are seeing is more activity there and I think what's encouraging and maybe I can turn it over to Angelica as well, our services business has seen an increase in a pickup in activity and certainly we saw consumables as well. So it still dampened demand and we did see that impact in Academia & Government, that was the biggest impact in China, but we are seeing some pockets of green shoot in terms of recovery.\nAngelica Riemann: Yes, Bob, I'll just add. In China, we are encouraged from a services perspective on the nice sequential growth that we saw from Q2 to Q3, which is indicative of continued and somewhat increasing lab activity in China.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That sounds encouraging. And then maybe another one for you, Bob. Just as we think about the margin construct as we work our way into year end and into 2025, maybe just remind us some of the moving pieces to think about high-level as we look ahead to next year, obviously, the cost out program seems to be progressing well to your point, the margins came in nicely here in 3Q. But yeah, maybe just the moving pieces as we go ahead to next year without talking too much about the top line, obviously, the volume matters there. But just kind of down the P&L, how to think about some of the margin algo for next year would be helpful.\nBob McMahon: Yes, I think as we talked about, Patrick, it's a great question and we're committed to continuing to drive efficiencies across all of the P&L line items and I think you've seen that across the actions that we've taken. We're on track to delivering that $100 million of incremental annualized savings by the end of 2024. So there will still be a tailwind, obviously going into 2025 for that benefit. Offsetting that will be some resets of our variable pay and activities like that, but we are committed to covering that. If I think about it at the highest level, what I would expect us to continue to be able to do is drive leveraged earnings next year. And I think you're seeing that the scale benefit that we're seeing in certainly our ACG business here this last quarter, just phenomenal profit contribution and I think with volume coming back into the instrument business as well, that will set us up nicely for next year. So think about a nice incremental tailwind associated with the continued actions or the annualization of that actions that come in FY 2025, partially offset by merit in some of the activities and then we'll have our ongoing productivity measures and some -- we'll actually share some of the more detail around this probably in our Analyst Day in December. So stay-tuned on that as well.\nPatrick Donnelly: Thanks. Okay. That's great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to dig into some of these instrument trends a little bit more. I was wondering, if you could talk about just what you're seeing across some of the big categories like LC, LCMS, GC, spectroscopy, any color on how those performed?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I mean in general terms, Jack, I think you know the customers are very, very cautious. But what I will say is that lab manager remain very engaged with our sales teams about future projects, that is true. We see a lot of stability in that. So it's still very challenged and I would say that, you know our deal close rate is still elevated, but our funnels are very stable with low cancellations. So I think that goes across most of the markets. And as you see going-forward, you know our results in CST and services growing mid-single digits and bodes very, very well in terms of lab activity increasing. So we're seeing slow, but steady improvement.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Jack, just to follow-on to that. I think one of the things as we mentioned in the call, the book-to-bill being at one for instruments is a positive sign. It was slightly better than what we expected. Overall, LSAG instruments were down low-double-digit.\nJack Meehan: Yes. Yeah. Were all the categories kind of right around there?\nPadraig McDonnell: I would say if you looked at the LC and LCMS business, they were in the mid-teens, our spectroscopy business better than that.\nJack Meehan: Okay. And then just as one end-market follow-up, I was curious in CAM in the third quarter, so it was down 5%, it was a little bit below what I was thinking. Is there anything just within the different categories within that end-market that softened a little bit relative to what you were thinking a few months ago?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, you're correct, it was declined by 5% and it was really due to the impact of overproduction in China, which negatively impacted market investments globally. But we did see increases in service and consumables, both combined at 7% increase, but there was a decrease of about 14% in instruments and I think CapEx spending remains slightly challenged there.\nJack Meehan: Yes. That makes sense. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One, I guess, Padraig or Bob, if you look at the guidance change over the last three months, NASD, China, biopharma, those have been the big categories, right? I think the guide assumes NASD doubled -- down double digits in fiscal 2024, China down high singles, double-digits, biopharma down, which of these is expected to get better next year? What is getting better or worse? And is there a first-half versus second-half dynamic that we should be aware of?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, Vijay, thanks for the question. I think in terms of what we expect getting better, we expect all of them to improve next year. We raised the midpoint of guidance, $15 million on revenue and $0.03 in EPS and we see across all those areas, markets improving slowly and that's reflected in the sequential increase that we're guiding in Q4. So while we had a kind of a solid Q3, the end market environment for capital remains constrained and visibility while improving is still difficult.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And maybe on that Q4 commentary for guidance implies I think up 6% or 7%, which seems generally in line with your historical sequential step-up from 3Q. And is the bookings trends that we saw and NASE trends we saw, does it support that historical, I guess, seasonality because I think where the Street is debating upon is that historical seasonality, does it bake in some year-end budget flush or what is baked into that sequential step-up?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So I think what we're seeing is that it's -- we normally see the step-up, that's what we're expecting this time. We're not including the budget flush in that. If we see a budget flush, it's on top and that will be in our Q1 numbers as we go forward.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Vijay, this is Bob and just to build-on what Padraig is saying, I mean you're absolutely right. When we look at the sequential, it is in-line with our historical in our order book based on what we've seen today. Obviously, we have to book orders in Q4, but our order book trends would support that.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, guys. Question on BIOVECTRA and maybe just synergies with the rest of the NASD business. How do you think about -- does that change views on capacity? And maybe just talk a little bit about how much of their BIOVECTRA business is clinical versus commercial and any kind of emerging modalities that you're adding here?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I'll start, Tycho and I'll bring in Simon in a minute. So we are absolutely delighted with BIOVECTRA. We think it's a great asset that enhances our offerings and it really allows us to deepen our relationships with our key pharma customers. And what we're really excited about is that it builds on our capabilities on the current NASD modalities around anti-sense and particularly gene editing with microbial fermentation and ADC capability. And so we're very happy with that. So there's a lot of synergies as we bring that forward. So I'll hand over to Simon to talk maybe about capacity in the main business.\nSimon May: Yes, I think Padraig hit many of the high notes already in terms of the synergies. We already mentioned the complete solution offering in gene editing, which we see as a really significant competitive advantage going forward. Sterile fill finish is another synergy that we're excited about. We've had a lot of request from our customers over the past few years for that capability. And from the diligence we've done with BIOVECTRA, we think they've got truly world-class capabilities there. And as Padraig also mentioned with microbial fermentation, high potency APIs, there's an existing footprint there in GLP-1 manufacturing. So I think we've got a slightly higher clinical mix in BIOVECTRA than we have in NASD. So I think we're just killing several birds with one stone with this acquisition. From a capacity perspective, I'd say BIOVECTRA has been ahead of the curve with capacity CapEx and we've got some skin to grow into there over the next few years\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-up on China. You had the pull-forward dynamic in the first quarter, $15 million. If that were back in 2Q, I think you were effectively flat, maybe down a little bit. First, is that the right assumption? What are you actually embedding in 4Q for China in guidance? And then how do you think about the return to growth in 2025? Could you see that in the first half of the year?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Hey, Tycho, that's -- your recollection is correct. And as we think about implied fourth quarter down mid-single digits in China, we're going up quite honestly against some easier compares in-full disclosure. And we would expect a slight sequential step-up from a revenue perspective as well. And so that reflects this steady improvement. We do expect, again, not a lot of that stimulus to come in our Q4, basically none, but more into Q5, but the bidding activity that we're seeing has ramped-up. And then I think the activity that we're seeing in services and consumables, we're expecting that to continue. It's probably too early to tell next year for China, but I would expect it to continue to improve and not be down the way it is. We're expecting a low double-digit decline this year, we would expect to improve from that and it will probably be improvement throughout the year as opposed to an immediate improvement. Certainly, the stimulus will help us with that. But again, that will be in our first and second quarters most likely, but we're not expecting a huge step-up right there. It will be overtime because this stimulus is over a three-year period.\nTycho Peterson: Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Instrumentation growth, obviously, an important question. You know, last quarter, you lowered expectations meaningfully, but again, book-to-bill was a strong more than one. Again, this quarter it is more than one and I think you said that, that last quarter was the first time you saw growth in the market after seven quarters. So that looks like it's continued again into the quarter. So just maybe help us understand instrument where we sit on instrumentation and what sort of recovery are you seeing here in August and what gives you sort of confidence that the instrumentation should bounce -- continue to bounce back into 2025 as well?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, look at the indications from the team, we have a strategic account team that does a lot of citations with our major accounts. There's -- we're seeing that more positive than negative in terms of customer sentiment, which is a very good sign. We see a lot of activity in our testing labs, as well as focusing on PFAS and so on. So there is drivers within the markets that are positive. But overall, I would say it's slow and steady and we're trading it as that. And the teams have really good visibility. Our commercial teams, which we've transformed in the last few years are really, really close to our customers. We have really good visibility into that. So it's slow, but steady. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob, to that?\nBob McMahon: Yes. No, I think you're spot-on and we're not building any budget flush into our Q4, Puneet. So if that does in fact happen, that would be a benefit to our current estimate.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Thanks. And then recent drug pricing negotiation with Medicare on the first drugs are out. Obviously, IRA is having an impact, but over the next three years annually, 15 drugs will be negotiated and that probably leads to another set of impacts. So what are you hearing from your large pharma customers and overall, how are they thinking about the R&D spend and the spend that they're -- that they currently have on Agilent?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I think in general, they're very cautious, of course, with some of the impacts, the macro impacts that are facing. They're not -- there's a lot of M&A activity going on within pharma, a lot of consolidation, which of course takes time and energy for these companies to focus on. And I think what you're going to see overtime is it probably even out in terms of impact. What isn't going down, by the way, is the number of R&D programs. We see that increasing in a number of key modality areas, particularly around GLP-1, etc. So we need to wait and see, but having said that, people kind of forget in the last few years the enormous amount of spend that has happened and we're seeing that normalize now, of course in the installed-base and coming out of that in 2025.\nPuneet Souda: Okay, fair. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to follow-up on maybe this is what Puneet was just getting at, but you called out in your prepared remarks a couple of times that with biopharma, small molecule held up a little bit better or small molecule did a little bit better than large molecule, I assume. Just wondering if you could delve into that a little bit more, was that a particular instrument class or modality that drove that? Was that -- does that have to do with budget cycles, just what you're seeing there and why there's such a difference in molecule type?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Mike, this is Bob. You're right, I mean, our small molecule business was down mid-single digits in the quarter, which was better-than-expected actually. And then in Europe, it grew, which was a very positive sign. And this does speak to -- you can only hold-on to your old instruments for so long before the replacements need to happen. We're not calling replacement cycle inflection just yet, but every quarter these instruments get older. And one of the things that I think is important here is, pill counts and volumes continue to grow. And back to the question around the IRA and the pricing, I think it was generally, you know, not the worst case scenario, maybe a little better than people expected. And where our strength is, is in the development moving into production and that continues to be long-term positive trend. So that would be our core LC franchise and then the biopharma, some of that was impacted by our NASD business, which was kind of the air pocket. Actually, if you take our biopharma business, which was down double digits and you take NASD out, we are at mid-single digits as well. Not as -- it was down a little more than small molecule, but generally still in that same range. So both of them are actually when you take out the kind of the one-time unique aspect of NASD performing better quarter-on-quarter, which is a positive sign.\nPadraig McDonnell: So I would say, just adding to that, Bob, we saw services growing double-digits in biopharma and mid-single digits in small molecules. So that's a big component of what we see in those different modalities.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. Both of those answers really helpful. And then for my follow-up, I want to lean in a little bit more on BIOVECTRA. I mean, everything you kind of laid out there for the rationale and the financials of the deal certainly makes sense. But I'm just curious, you know, you've had a presence in some CDMO type capabilities in the past. Just wondering how hard are you going to lean into this? And what I'm alluding to is obviously, one of your large traditional tools vendors has a CDMO business has been in that business for a number of years now and there's a lot of talk of the benefits of having both the instrument, the consumables and the services business on the tail-end. Is this something you're going to continue to grow overtime? Is it BIOVECTRA like a beachhead acquisition? I mean we should expect more investment down the road?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I'll start and then maybe hand it over to Simon. When we look at our M&A ambition, first of all, we're -- it's going to be -- it's going to be really centered around where our strategy is, what's the strategic fit in faster-growing markets and of course, value creation. BIOVECTRA takes all of those boxes and it's an area of where we're building out more capabilities for customers. So we see that continuing. And so we're really excited about it, but we do see that this business has a lot of runway. It's a business that's growing well, very well-run, of course and has had a lot of capital investment over a number of years. And I think this is only the start of our ambition in continuing to grow BIOVECTRA and NASD. But Simon?\nSimon May: Not much to add really, only beyond that, we've got a very strong existing position in the RNA modality. I'd say up until this point, it's been a relatively narrow capability position and BIOVECTRA builds on that quite nicely as we look at future optionality around complementary capabilities and modalities, we think it's a rich space and that's probably all we can say at this point.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just back to China, the down 11% was a bit better than we were looking for. Can you just unpack what specifically got better in the quarter given the guidance cut that you made last quarter, maybe either by customer type or by product type? And then just to clear up, like so your guidance for China, I know it was down double digit. Has that changed at all? Have you improved that? So that's my first question.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Dan. Thanks for the question. China is still in line with our full-year end guidance down low-double-digits. If I look at where we actually performed slightly better than what we anticipated, it was actually in pharma and it gets back to what we were talking about before, the activity both on the services side performing sequentially better, as well as our consumables business actually growing. And so we were down you know close to 30% in Q2 of last year, we were down low double-digits in pharma year-on-year. And so that was the big sequential improvement in Q3 and I would expect that to continue into Q4.\nDan Brennan: Okay. Thanks, Bob. And then sorry to go back to NASD, but there's just been a lot of questions from investors after the turn of events year-to-date in terms of that business really slowing a lot. Can you -- did you say what it did actually in the quarter? I didn't hear the number kind of year-over-year, what did NSD do in the quarter and then kind of if we take your guidance full-year, I know you said step-up, could you just give us some clarity on the quarter? And then any additional color on clinical versus commercial? It sounds like your bookings are improving, so that portends well for the outlook, but just trying to unpack like what's going on right now in the quarter? Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Dan. What I would say is, we typically don't give a specific number for NASD, but it actually performed in line or slightly better than what we expected. So we had been signaling a step down in Q3 and we actually did better than what we were expecting there. The full-year is still in line with where we were, which is roughly a $300 million business. As Simon was saying, the bookings continue to be positive in terms of activity and we're starting to see some of our customers, the readouts of some of the activities, which is more a harbinger of long-term opportunity versus short-term. But you know, if anything, it was a little better than we expected. So I don't want anyone to takeaway that it wasn't -- even though it was down in the quarter, we expected that and communicated that as part of our guidance and we're still on-track for the full-year estimate that we had coming into the quarter.\nDan Brennan: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey, guys, thanks for the questions. Maybe first, just could you talk about growth rates by segment for the fiscal fourth quarter and maybe your assumptions for instrumentation versus consumables and services in the fourth quarter?\nPadraig McDonnell: Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes, I'll -- hey, Catherine, it's Bob. What I would say is, if I look at our Q4, all groups, we would expect to do better and if I went by group, LSAG would be -- we're expecting kind of low single digits off of a down 7% this year. Consumables being better than that overall and with the instrument side, still probably down slightly or would be down slightly. DGD down mid-single digits and ACG up mid-single digits towards the high-end. That's what we've embedded in our guidance. So all three of those actually performing better than where we were in Q3.\nCatherine Schulte: Yes, perfect. And then maybe going back to Small Molecule, nice to see the improvement there. I think what was just Small Molecule performance excluding China? I know you said Europe grew, but just curious to get more color on what you're seeing elsewhere?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I think what we're seeing is Europe was a standout in Small Molecule, a lot of activity there, but probably stable across the different markets on us. And what we did see from the Small Molecule side, we did see pretty good growth in services that as well as has had that number, but I think overall Europe ahead, but everywhere else stable.\nBob McMahon: Yes. What -- and so we were down mid-single digits and as Padraig said, if you took China out, we were down low-single digits everywhere else.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Waldman: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for you. Padraig or Bob, maybe first a follow-up. On your assumption for no budget flushing impact on pharma instrumentation, is that just a function of the timing of your quarter relative to calendar year-end buying from these customers? Or are there other things you're seeing that are leaving you on the sidelines as it relates to end of your pharma spending? And then a related question was, curious any high-level thoughts you had on 2025 based on planning conversations you're having with pharma accounts, are you thinking next year should be a return to normal growth type year in pharma instrument budget as budgets are reset or is it more of a gradual recovery or return to normal over a couple of year period. Any feedback you're getting from accounts on that?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I'll take the first one and maybe hand-off to Bob for the second one. I think it's a year ago and we were -- people were talking about budget flushes. We didn't expect it and we didn't see it. We saw a little bit, but not much. We're expecting the same this time, of course, our year-end at the end of October. So if we do see any activity will be in Q1 2025. Why do we see this is because we're very close to our customers. We know exactly when, where the funnel is, where the deals are and where installed base, we have a lot of installed base information. So we're not expecting it anything substantial at the end-of-the year. But what we are seeing is a lot more conversations about next year, slow, steady recovery and we're hearing that across the board. I don't know if you want to take the second question, Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Josh, on 2025 as we were saying, it's probably too early to say. But what I -- our current indication is that it's not going to snap back November 1st to be back to normal. I do think that you'll continue to see a recovery throughout FY 2025 and get back to that long-term growth rate sometime in 2025, that's the way we kind of think about it. But I don't think it's another two to three year estimate either or based on our conversations with our customers right now. So it's probably in between.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Okay. And then just had a follow-up on ACG. I was curious if you could provide a bit more context on the dynamics you're seeing there, especially interested in what you're seeing from an RFP and win rate dynamic in the contracted business? And then you mentioned, I think in the slide decks, benefiting from mix. I was wondering if you could flush that out a bit?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I'll take the first part of that question and hand it over to Angelica. Extremely pleased with ACG's performance and that's years of investment in a broad product offerings in key markets, that are really being received by customers in this environment where they want to get more productivity out of their systems, they want to use their assets in different ways. And we've seen the flow through to our results in spite of the CapEx challenges all year. So the business performs extremely well and the margins are extremely good. So I'll ask Angelica to provide more color on the contract business. But I think what's really interesting is our enterprise service business as well. Angelica?\nAngelica Riemann: Yes, so to really dive in on the contracts, right? It's nearly 70% of our business in Q3 and it's continuing to grow double-digit. As we continue to see that strong demand in our enterprise service offerings, which are in the high -- the mid-teens, it's really about being there to help customers optimize their lab operations, improve their productivity and our offers really facilitate our customers improving the lab operations, the efficiencies and the waste reduction. So we're continuing to see some very strong and sticky behavior within our contracts franchise.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And Josh, just on the comment on mix is, when we have business on-contract, that generally is good for us and good for our customers as well.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Okay. Appreciate all the detail.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I know it's late in the call, that being said, I got three lightning round questions, which I'm going to rattle through and then listen to the answers. The first is on math. If recurring revenue growth was up mid-single digits in the quarter, it seems like instruments has to be down around 20%, maybe more based on the numbers you reported in the 10-Q in Q3 of last year. Bob, I think you said in response to Matt Sykes' question, it was down low-double digits. What are we missing? Just not trying to be too picky here, but it just seems important in the context of assessing trends and what way to put on your book-to-bill commentary. So that's the first question. The second is on China stimulus. Any change in dynamics regarding stalling either in terms of conversions or even cancellations? There's some skeletal that that there's been some recent changes as the shape of stimulus becomes a bit more clear? And then the third question is on 2025. If you exit 2024 with flattish core growth in Q4, that would obviously be a positive trend relative to what we've seen over the last few quarters. That said, it would seem like if you draw a straight line that you'd be on track to exit 2025 at around, call it 5%, maybe 6% growth rather than growing mid-single digits for the year. So I think you need a fundamental improvement in overall market conditions and/or a real impact from China stimulus to get to mid-singles for the year. I just want to see if any of my logic is flawed there? Thank you and have a good night.\nPadraig McDonnell: That's certainly a lightning round, Doug, but we'll try and we'll answer it. I think, Bob, you can take the first and the last one, I'll take China.\nBob McMahon: Yes. The comment that I had on Instruments was specifically related to LSAG instruments and they were down low double-digit. Consumables was up mid-single digits for the total being down minus 7%. So that is. We do have some instrumentation in DGG as well that was down roughly the same as where LSAG was. So down 20% is way too negative. I'll turn it over to Padraig for the second one and then I can jump back into last one.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I think, we're very close to our China team and the local team has seen an increased activity. We're seeing that improve from last quarter and for clarity, of course, we're not building any benefit from the stimulus into our Q4 guide. But what we're seeing is, we're seeing in early days, what we're hearing that the stimulus is broader in terms of its reach over a three-year period. Having said that, we are hearing that the first tranche will likely be focused on Academic & Government accounts. But again, it's early days, as it trickles down through provinces, as the mechanism of the funding goes, we'll be sure to update as we know that.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And I think just the last one real quick. It's too early. We're not going to get into what we're looking at for FY 2025 other than to say that we expect improvement throughout the year.\nOperator: And I'll now turn the call back over to Parmeet Ahuja for any closing remarks.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Regina and thanks everyone for joining the call today. With that, we'd like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

    "fullTranscript": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Alcoa Corporation Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Presentation and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Louis Langlois, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.\nLouis Langlois: Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, Alcoa Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly. As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted on this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Bill.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Thank you, Louis, and welcome to our second quarter 2025 earnings conference call. We delivered strong operational performance this quarter, both in terms of safety and stability. This is an important value driver for the company. We maintained a fast pace of execution on our priorities and continue to steer through changing market conditions. Let's begin with safety. Safety performance remained strong in the second quarter with no fatal or serious injuries reported. Injury rates continue to trend below our full year 2024 benchmarks, supported by a sustained emphasis on leader time in field. This initiative enables leaders to engage directly with teams, conduct safety observations and deliver both positive reinforcement and constructive feedback. We continued executing on our strategic priorities. On July 1, we closed the sale of our 25.1% stake in the Ma'aden joint ventures for a total value of $1.35 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion of Ma'aden shares and $150 million of cash. In late April, we successfully concluded a 5-year tax dispute in Australia with a favorable ruling for Alcoa. The Australian Review Tribunal affirmed our long-standing position, determining that no additional tax was owed. This outcome reflects the substantial effort and dedication of our internal and external legal and tax teams whose strong defense was instrumental in achieving this result. Throughout the quarter, we steered through frequent tariff updates that demanded agile decision- making and rapid adjustments across both sales and supply operations. We redirected portions of our Canadian production to serve non-U.S. customers to mitigate Section 232 tariff impacts. In parallel, we sustained active advocacy and engagement with policymakers on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border. Finally, our recent customer engagements continue to signal encouraging demand trends. We extended our supply agreement with Prysmian, a global leader in energy and telecom cable systems and completed our first North American sale of EcoLum, a value-added low-carbon product, further reinforcing our position as a supplier of choice for sustainable aluminum solutions. In summary, we delivered strong performance across the areas within our control while continuing to advocate for trade policies that support both Alcoa and the broader U.S. aluminum industry. Now I'll turn it over to Molly to take us through the financial results.\nMolly S. Beerman: Thank you, Bill. Revenue was down 10% sequentially to $3 billion. In the Alumina segment, third-party revenue decreased 28% on lower average realized third-party price, partially offset by increased shipments. In the Aluminum segment, third-party revenue increased 3% due to increased shipments and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by a decrease in average realized third-party price. While the Midwest premium increased during the quarter in response to the increase in U.S. tariffs, the increase was more than fully offset by lower LME, resulting in a decrease in the realized price of aluminum. Second quarter net income attributable to Alcoa was $164 million versus the prior quarter of $548 million, with earnings per common share decreasing to $0.62 per share. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to Alcoa was $103 million or $0.39 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $313 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. The sequential decrease in adjusted EBITDA of $542 million is primarily due to lower alumina and aluminum prices and increased U.S. Section 232 tariff costs on aluminum imported into the U.S. from our Canadian smelters. The Alumina segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $525 million, primarily due to lower alumina prices. In addition, higher production costs, energy costs and raw material costs were only partially offset by higher volumes. The Aluminum segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $37 million. While lower metal prices and unfavorable currency were more than offset by lower alumina costs, the segment was impacted by $95 million in U.S. Section 232 tariffs, which includes the increase in the tariff rate from 25% to 50% effective June 4. These impacts were only partially offset by price/mix improvements and higher volumes. Outside the segments, other corporate costs increased, while intersegment eliminations changed favorably due to lower average alumina price requiring less inventory profit elimination. Moving on to cash flow activities for the second quarter. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.5 billion. Cash from operations was positive again this quarter, providing $488 million, along with a working capital release of $251 million. Working capital decreased from the first quarter as accounts receivable came down with the lower prices for alumina. Subsequent to close of the second quarter, on July 1, we received approximately 86 million shares of Ma'aden and $150 million of cash for the sale of our interest in the Ma'aden joint ventures. The majority of the cash will be used to pay related taxes and transaction fees. Moving on to other key financial metrics. The year-to-date return on equity was positive at 22.5%. Days working capital was flat sequentially at 47 days. Our second quarter dividend added $27 million to stockholder capital returns. We had positive free cash flow for the quarter of $357 million. Turning to the outlook. We have 4 adjustments to our full year outlook. First, we are adjusting our annual outlook for aluminum shipments to 2.5 million to 2.6 million metric tons, down from our initial estimate of 2.6 million to 2.8 million metric tons. The change is due to reduced shipments from the San Ciprián smelter where the restart was disrupted by the nationwide power outage in April. As separately announced earlier this week, the joint venture has decided to resume the restart process in the third quarter. The reduction in aluminum shipments will primarily impact the third quarter due to the timing of the San Ciprián ramp-up. Second, we are lowering other corporate costs to $160 million from our initial estimate of $170 million due to reductions in corporate expenses and favorable currency impacts. Third, we are increasing our outlook for interest expense to $180 million from our prior estimate of $165 million due to unfavorable value-added tax assessments. And last, we have adjusted the return-seeking CapEx outlook for 2025 to $50 million, down from $75 million as the pace of spend has not matched the original forecast. For the third quarter of 2025, in the Alumina segment, we expect performance to improve by approximately $20 million with lower maintenance costs and higher production. In the Aluminum segment, we expect higher Midwest premium revenue in relation to the increased tariffs. Premium changes can be calculated from the sensitivities provided in the appendix. Those premium gains will be offset by approximately $90 million in sequential expense increase for tariff costs. With the increase in the U.S. Section 232 tariff rate from 25% to 50%, we expect quarterly tariff costs to approximate [ $215 million ] based on an LME of $2,600 and Midwest premium of $0.67 per pound. While costs related to the San Ciprián restart will be higher sequentially, they are not material, and we expect to cover with improvements in other operations. Alumina cost in the Aluminum segment is expected to be favorable by $100 million. Our updates exclude impacts from the recently announced tariffs on U.S. imports from Brazil. Below EBITDA, other expenses in the third quarter are expected to remain consistent with the second quarter. Based on last week's pricing, we expect third quarter operational tax expense of $50 million to $60 million. Tax expense in the third quarter is notably higher than the second quarter, which included a catch-up benefit to reflect the annualized effective tax rate when applied to year-to- date earnings. In the appendix to the earnings materials, you will see that our Midwest paid and Midwest unpaid premium sensitivities have been updated to reflect the expected trade flows as a result of additional tariff impacts. We also revised our regional premium distribution to align with our efforts to redirect tons and optimize margins. Currently, approximately 30% of our Canadian aluminum production is available for spot sales and can be redirected to customers outside the U.S. when the premium shipping and tariff netback calculations favor another destination. Additional updates to our sensitivities may be needed as we continue to adjust our trade flows to the tariff structure. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Thanks, Molly. While tariffs continue to drive near-term volatility, the broader outlook for aluminum demand remains robust. This slide illustrates Alcoa's long-term demand forecast underpinned by powerful global megatrends across key sectors. Transportation leads as the largest and fastest-growing sector, driven by the shift to electric vehicles, lightweighting initiatives and increased vehicle production. Construction shows more modest growth tempered by a slowdown in China, though emerging markets and favorable macroeconomic conditions like lower long-term interest rates and increased fiscal spending in Europe offer upside potential. Packaging is expanding rapidly, fueled by consumer preference for recyclable materials. Electrical demand is accelerating due to the global energy transition with aluminum playing a critical role in renewable power generation and grid modernization. Other sectors, including consumer durables and machinery and equipment are also expected to grow steadily. Importantly, the geography of growth is shifting. Primary aluminum demand is projected to grow significantly faster in markets outside China at a 3% CAGR from 2025 to 2030, while China's growth slows to just 0.2% CAGR, largely met by recycled metal. Within Alcoa's core regions, North America is expected to lead with a 3.8% CAGR and Europe is projected to grow at 1.5%. Three structural drivers underpin the overall aluminum growth trajectory. The green and digital transition. Aluminum is essential to electrification, decarbonization and digital infrastructure, supporting everything from electric vehicles to data centers. Second is the rise of developing economies, the China transition and reshoring in North America and Europe. As China's growth moderates, developing economies are stepping up. Meanwhile, reshoring in North America and Europe, often driven by trade policy continues to boost regional demand. Third, material substitution. Aluminum's recyclability and performance make it a preferred alternative to copper, plastics and other materials, especially in closed-loop systems. Despite short-term uncertainty, these megatrends provide a resilient and compelling road map for long-term aluminum demand growth. Now turning to our markets, starting with alumina. After a sharp decline during the first quarter, alumina prices rebounded somewhat in recent months. As noted in our previous earnings update, over 80% of Chinese refineries were operating at a deficit due to high bauxite prices and low alumina prices. In response, approximately 10 million metric tons of refining capacity in China was curtailed or reduced for maintenance during April and May. These production cuts contributed to a more balanced market and supported the price recovery seen in the second quarter. Looking ahead, market dynamics will continue to be shaped by capacity expansions in Indonesia, India and China. As new supply comes online, we anticipate further production cuts and plant maintenance in China may be necessary to maintain market balance in the second half of the year. On the bauxite front, prices have remained elevated due to supply uncertainty stemming from mining license withdrawals in Guinea. These disruptions could intensify with the onset of the rainy season, further tightening supply. In this dynamic environment, Alcoa's global refinery network continues to provide reliable aluminum supply to both our smelters and key customers. We're also capitalizing on high bauxite prices with our Juruti mine on track to achieve record sales volumes this year. Let's now move on to aluminum. LME prices dipped in April, coinciding with the reciprocal tariffs announced on April 2, but regained momentum over the course of the quarter. Despite this recovery, prices remained below first quarter levels, reflecting ongoing market volatility. U.S. Midwest premium initially surged in early June following the implementation of the 50% Section 232 tariffs, reaching $0.68 per pound and now stands at $0.67 as of late last week. This remains below analyst estimates of approximately $0.75 per pound to fully offset the tariff costs. The Midwest duty unpaid index calculated by subtracting the tariff from the duty paid premium has shown negative or near 0 values at times. This theoretical index only holds when the market is priced on marginal imports, which hasn't consistently been the case. In response, we sold over 100,000 metric tons of Canadian metal normally destined for the U.S. to non-U.S. customers since March, and we'll continue this strategy until the Midwest premium fully reflects the new tariff structure. From a demand perspective, conditions remained steady in both Europe and North America, although sector performance is mixed. Electrical and packaging continue to perform well. Construction appears to be stabilizing and automotive remains the most affected by tariff-related uncertainty. In China, easing trade tensions with the U.S. are providing a modest boost to demand. On the supply side, growth was limited in the second quarter with only marginal increases from smelter restarts and expansions. Global production remains constrained, particularly outside of China. Specific to Alcoa, in North America, our value-added product order book remains stable with strong demand for slab, billet and rod. In Europe, VAP volumes improved slightly in the second quarter with billet demand strengthening and rod and slabs demand holding firm. However, foundry orders softened in both regions, largely due to uncertainty in the automotive sector tied to tariff impacts. We are progressing the approvals for our next major mine regions in Western Australia, Myara North and Holyoake as well as our current mine plan, which had been referred by a third party. The 12-week public comment period for both approvals, which began in late May, is a statutory part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process. It enables individuals, communities and stakeholders to share input, raise concerns and recommendations for consideration. Concurrently, we are supporting the public comment period through a comprehensive communication and engagement campaign. The focus of the campaign is to ensure that the public has access to accurate information and facts about our environmental performance in Australia and understands our commitment to responsible mining in the Northern jarrah forest. Some key highlights include over 55 years of rehabilitation experience. Only 2% of the Northern jarrah forest has been cleared for mining. No mining in old growth forests, operations are limited to areas previously cleared for timber and 75% of cleared forest has been rehabilitated. The campaign also showcases the expertise and dedication of our Alcoa professionals who apply a science-based approach to biodiversity and rehabilitation. Given the complexity of advancing 2 mine approvals at the same time, the volume of documentation submitted by Alcoa and independent experts and the anticipated effort to review and respond to public submissions, the original time line for mine approvals is no longer feasible. While ministerial approval was initially targeted in the first quarter of 2026, it is now expected that the process will extend beyond that time frame. Following the public consultation period, we expect the Western Australia EPA will publish a revised time line. We remain committed to working collaboratively with the Western Australia EPA and other stakeholders to secure ministerial decisions as early as possible in 2026. In the meantime, we have developed multiple contingency plans and expect to continue accessing bauxite of similar grade until the new mine regions are operational. We will continue to engage with stakeholders to fulfill our responsibilities as a trusted miner and to sustain our right to mine for decades to come. To conclude, in the second quarter, Alcoa delivered strong safety results and operational performance in areas within our control. We also made meaningful progress on our strategic priorities. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing at pace across our 2025 priorities, enhancing operational competitiveness, navigating market dynamics to deliver long-term value for our stockholders and advancing the approval process for our Western Australian mine plans. With that, let's open the floor for questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets.\nKatja Jancic: Maybe starting on the tariff side. Molly, I think you mentioned that the current outlook doesn't include anything for potential, I guess, 50% tariffs on Brazil. How would -- if that does happen, is there any way you get impacted from that potentially?\nMolly S. Beerman: Katja, it depends on if alumina is indeed excluded. Our read of it now is that it's covered under the annex. But until we see the executive order that would be related to Brazil, we can't assure that. If that were the case, we are sourcing our U.S. smelters with Brazilian alumina. Now we could redirect supply and provide them from Western Australia, but obviously, that will take time and cost more in terms of shipping. But we have that option. And depending on how that executive order is written, we can adapt.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. And maybe just another question, Bill, on the Western Australia contingency plans. Can you discuss what some of those plants could be? And how could that impact your cost?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So at this point, as far as an impact on cost, we don't anticipate any impact in 2025 or 2026. The expectation that we would be into the new mine areas in late 2027 has now slipped out into 2028. We have a series of contingency plans that cover different mining areas, potentially going deeper in the pits that we're in that allow us to be comfortable that we are working through the process, and we'll get the right approvals.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Alex Hacking with Citi.\nAlexander Nicholas Hacking: Just following up on Katja's question there on WA. If the delays to the new mine areas are extended, can you keep mining the lower grade areas for a period of additional years? Or it would be more urgent than that?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So we'll continue to mine the areas that we're in today. And as I said to Katja, the -- no impact on '25, '26. As we said, we expect it to be in the new mines in late '27. That slips out till 2028 at this point, but we do have contingency plans in place that can go up to -- all the way up to a 15-month delay if needed.\nAlexander Nicholas Hacking: Okay. What if it's longer than 15 months?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: We'll work through that, and we'll look at what implications it has on operating rates in Pinjarra, but we'll work through that when we get there.\nAlexander Nicholas Hacking: Okay. And then just following up on the tariff maths. I mean, Molly, you mentioned that I think it was $215 million a quarter in Section 232 cost. Is that being more than offset by what you're getting on the additional Midwest premium at the moment?\nMolly S. Beerman: Yes. Alex, let me give you the numbers of what we experienced for the second quarter. So if you look at -- in our bridge discussion, we talked about the tariffs being $95 million more in the second quarter. That's on top of the $20 million that we paid in the first quarter. So the cost in the second quarter was about $115 million. We only saw a Midwest premium uptick of about $60 million. So we had margin compression of about $55 million, and that's related to our Canadian tons. Now obviously, we're getting a benefit on our U.S. tons, but I'm giving you the compression that we felt on the Canadian.\nAlexander Nicholas Hacking: Sorry, the $60 million additional, is that -- that's just on the Canadian tons or that includes the U.S. tons?\nMolly S. Beerman: Just on the Canadian tons. If you look at -- so Alex, let me just give you a little bit more color. If you look at the pricing today, so it's LME at $2,600 and Midwest premium at $0.67 a pound, we are near neutral or even slightly positive if you look at the volumes as a whole because the higher uptick in Midwest premium on the U.S. tons would be more than the net negative on our Canadian tons. So that's at this current pricing. If this were to hold from a whole year perspective, we would be about neutral to slightly positive.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: And the one point that we continue to make is and I think other analysts that follow the space make it, the current Midwest doesn't support the overall tariff costs coming out of Canada. So current -- Midwest is sitting at $0.67, $0.68. We think it needs to be between $0.70 and $0.75 depending on how you look at it to cover total tariff costs. And that's why we have moved -- repositioned metal going that was expected to go into the U.S. that is now going into destinations outside of the U.S. just because that math doesn't work currently. And anywhere we can take advantage of that, we will and move tons for other destinations.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Daniel Major with UBS.\nDaniel Edward Major: Just very quick first one. Just to clarify the maths on the tariff costs, you had $115 million cost in the second quarter, and you said it's going to be a negative $90 million delta. So it's $205 million the run rate of cost in the second quarter. Is that correct?\nMolly S. Beerman: That will be the third quarter cost, yes, $205 million. And then we're saying again at latest pricing. So if you dialed forward, that would be the $215 million that we guided to in tariff cost.\nDaniel Edward Major: Sorry, you said latest pricing, you mean spot pricing or like...\nMolly S. Beerman: Yes. Sorry. The $205 million is what we gave as the outlook for the third quarter. So that's a $90 million sequential change. And then we were also saying that our quarterly tariff cost at today's pricing is $215 million.\nDaniel Edward Major: Got it. Clear. That's very good. Yes. Then second question just on San Ciprián. You updated the respective net income drag and cash burn this year. Can you give us any sense of expectations for 2026 at this point? My guess would be the refinery will continue to burn cash. But is there any guidance you can give on either the cash burn or [ not ] at the smelter and the refinery?\nMolly S. Beerman: Yes, Daniel, we're not giving the guide there yet, but you're right. At recent market prices, the Spanish operations are challenged. From the smelter, the delay to the restart after the power outage has driven the full ramp-up into '26. We do expect after full ramp-up that the smelter will be profitable, but the refinery -- while having a first quarter '25 income, they will move into a loss position for the rest of the year, and they will struggle still at this API level into '26.\nDaniel Edward Major: Okay. But at spot, you can confirm that the smelter would be cash neutral?\nMolly S. Beerman: The smelter had fully ramped up a level would be profitable.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: But remember, it won't be fully ramped up in 2026. I mean it will hit the -- our anticipation is that it will hit the ramp-up schedule for 2026. But for the full year, it still will -- it will be going through the process of ramping up.\nMolly S. Beerman: We won't be fully ramped up until midyear '26.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Nick Giles with B. Riley.\nHenry Hearle: This is Henry Hearle on for Nick Giles today. So on our estimates, you have about 50,000 metric tons of spare annual capacity at Warrick and the Midwest premium has increased sharply to reflect that tariffs may be stickier than originally thought. So my math, the spare capacity at Warrick could generate over $100 million of EBITDA annually. And so what prevents you guys from restarting this capacity today?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Thanks for the question, and it's a great question. We're currently running 3 lines at Warrick. We have a fourth line at Warrick that would produce approximately 50,000 tons. The issue in Warrick is that, that fourth line needs a lot of work and will take some time to get restarted. So our estimate is that it would be about $100 million investment to restart that fourth line, and it would take us about a year to get it up and running. So we will certainly continue to run the numbers on Warrick. We would need to ensure that the tariffs will stick around for quite a while given that ramp-up curve in Warrick before we made the decision of investing another $100 million in a restart in Warrick.\nHenry Hearle: That definitely makes sense. Continued best of luck.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.\nWilliam Chapman Peterson: On the mid-2026 restart of San Ciprián, it still implies 75% utilization. Can you remind us of, I guess, when the term of the agreement with the workforce comes to [ an end ] and whether the delayed restart has any impact on that?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So after -- Bill, thanks for the question. After the power outage occurred in Spain, we declared force majeure with -- on that contract because it limited our ability to be able to meet the deadlines that are included in the contract. Recall that we had anticipated a full restart by October 1 of 2020 -- sorry, 2025. And then from there, we had some flexibility on how we run the plant after that full restart. Because of the power outage, we have said that we were not going to meet that October 1 deadline, and we've moved it back to the middle part of 2026.\nWilliam Chapman Peterson: Okay. And then kind of a different angle on the tariffs. And last quarter, I asked you about conversations with the U.S. government. But I guess in light of the tariffs remaining where they are now, how should we think about the commercial strategy, things like tariff cost sharing? And maybe perhaps you can share additional color on your shifting flows to non-U.S. customers. How should we think about that in the coming months? And then finally, is there any opportunities from relief from the Canadian government in the meantime?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So we have had extensive conversations on both sides of the border. I've been talking to the Carney administration often. I've been talking to the U.S. administration often. And at a 50% tariff, you saw us take action to redirect 100,000 tons to non-U.S. customers. As Molly said in her prepared remarks, we have the ability of about 30% of the Canadian volume to be able to redirect that to non-U.S. destination. And we will do so as long as the netbacks make more sense to ship it to other places than the U.S. So we've been very dynamic and handled this situation very quickly, and we'll continue to do so in the future. I felt like that was a multipart question. Did I miss any [indiscernible]\nWilliam Chapman Peterson: Yes. Just anything on tariff cost sharing that you might add?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Well, when you say tariff cost sharing, we -- through the Midwest premium, the Midwest premium is largely passing on the higher tariffs to our customers. So just to be clear, we are saying the Midwest premium needs to be, let's say, $0.75 to fully cover the tariffs. We're able to pass through 90% of that through a higher Midwest premium to our customers. So while we're not particularly thrilled with the tariffs, our customers are paying significantly higher prices for aluminum in the United States than they would pay anywhere else in the world.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChristopher LaFemina: It might be a dumb question, but isn't it the case that the tariffs are really just a net neutral for you? Because if you're diverting tons away from the U.S. because you can get better prices elsewhere, the Midwest premium goes up. And unless the Midwest premium is high enough for you to sell to the U.S., well, then you want to sell there. And at the end of the day, it's really -- I mean, in equilibrium, it should be a net neutral. And it's the customers in the U.S. will pay the premium. But I'm not really sure why the guidance should be for any net impact other than if you only consider where Midwest premium is today and where the LME price is today. But over time, shouldn't it be a wash? That's my first question.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So let me address this, and Molly can certainly feel free to jump in. With all the numbers that Molly gave us earlier in the call, in the end, if the Midwest premium reacts accordingly, it's a net neutral to Alcoa. However, there's a big however there. Our customers in the U.S. are seeing significantly higher prices than anywhere else in the world. And if you assume that they can pass that on to their customers, then I get the net neutral to them, but somebody ends up eating that tariff cost. And there are dedicated supply chains from Canada to our customers, literally trains that go from door to door from our plants to our customers that our belief is that it makes the most sense for the industry to have metal being able to flow from Canada to the U.S. with either a lower tariff or no tariff at all. And so -- and that's the best thing we think for our customers and for our industry to be able to do that.\nChristopher LaFemina: Right. So in that case, the impact of the tariffs is really on total demand, in which case, LME prices would go down. But the net impact -- I mean, other than the overall kind of price -- global LME price impact, the impact on Alcoa should still be neutral, right? Because either way, the Midwest premium has got to equal the tariffs over time.\nMolly S. Beerman: Chris, you have to remember that we do have customer contracts. So we don't have full flexibility to move the metal dynamically. So 70% of our Canadian metal is on contract, so that needs to flow into the U.S. for customer commitment.\nChristopher LaFemina: Okay. And then sorry, just a second question on the ATO, which I think you had $225 million in taxes now by the middle of next year. Is any of that provisioned on the balance sheet yet? How do we think about the kind of cash flow impact of that and the balance sheet impact of that?\nMolly S. Beerman: Yes. That is fully reserved on the balance sheet now as a tax payable.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: And Chris, I'm just going to add to that, and I can't help myself. That is a major win for Alcoa. That was a large overhang on the company and on the stock. We have been battling that for 5 years now. And to get that behind us is a really big deal. And I'll give some credit to our tax and legal team here that stuck with it and really presented a great case. So I'm pleased that we're able to put that behind us.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Just on the last point you made, Molly, that 70% of your Canadian smelting output is under contract to be sold to U.S. customers. When does -- when can you start renegotiating potentially those contracts so that, that 70% decreases?\nMolly S. Beerman: So those are annual contracts, but also understand we have firm customer relationships that we're not going to jeopardize. So Carlos, you could see some flexibility, but it's going to be a careful balance of respecting our strong customer relations as well as moving the metal to get the best margin.\nCarlos De Alba: All right. Okay. And if I may, just on the progress on the Alumar smelter in Brazil. What is the capacity utilization at which you are running? And when do you expect to get sort of a steady state?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So we continue to struggle with the Alumar restart. And we're sitting at about 92% capacity today. So net-net, we moved a little bit forward over the last quarter. The issue there, Carlos, is some of the patch pots that we had not anticipated having to reline are failing faster than what we had anticipated. So it's a battle. We take, I would say, a step and a half forward and a step backward just about every day in Alumar. And we're anticipating that we'll have that restarted completely this year. However, I've told you that before. And I think we're -- that's my target, but I've missed my target before. So take that with a grain of salt.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Lawson Winder with Bank of America.\nLawson Winder: Bill and Molly, thank you for today's update. Just wanted to follow up on the Ma'aden closing. And whether there's any new thinking on the potential to monetize that amount or even just simply lower your overall borrowing cost using that as collateral?\nMolly S. Beerman: Lawson, while we have the option to monetize those shares during the lockup period, recall the lockup period, we cannot sell shares until the third, fourth and fifth anniversary, [ the third ] each year. But to monetize those would be complex transactions, and that would be classified as debt on our balance sheet, and that might not really be a cost-effective source of liquidity either. While we don't expect to hold the shares for an extended period of time after each lockup period expires, we don't have plans to monetize and advance. Right now, we don't have a specific use for the cash that would [ have ] us add that debt to our balance sheet.\nLawson Winder: And then as you report those gains and losses going forward, I assume you'll be adjusting those out?\nMolly S. Beerman: Yes. So it will be mark-to-market, and you'll see special items to remove that from our regular operations.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.\nJohn Charles Tumazos: I'm curious as to the confidence you have in Spain restarting this week that the utility will deliver electricity. Presumably, the population grows something like 10% July, August with tourism. And then there's air conditioning, electricity demand in the heat of the summer. So are there any guarantees of power delivery or something that's different than August 28 when the wind didn't blow?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So John, it's a question that we've been wrestling with since the wind didn't blow on the date earlier in the year. We've been working with the national and regional representatives of the country, and they have developed, and this is obviously not just our prompting, but prompting from other industry. In Spain, they've approved a list of 65 actions in the energy sector that are designed to make the electricity grid more resilient. They are incorporating additional tools in the networks like voltage control, working on stability in the face of oscillations. So they are working to strengthen the electrical systems. There's no guarantees in life, and -- but they are taking, we believe, the right measures to ensure that the power stays on.\nJohn Charles Tumazos: As you start up Monday, the 14th, how many pots per week do you energize? Is the circumstance in late July and August where you're really not drawing very much electricity because of the gradual nature of the process?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Yes. So it's a gradual ramp-up process, and we should hit the target by the middle part of next year. My recollection is there's 500 pots in Spain. So we'll be starting -- you can do the math on how many pots we have to start to hit total production by the middle part of next year. But yes, we'll be starting a few pots a week to get to that restart done.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Glyn Lawcock with Barrenjoey.\nGlyn Lawcock: Firstly, Bill, just wondering if you could share any thoughts on how discussions with the government are going regarding the tariff. I had heard that maybe Canada could be in line for a reduction relative to the rest of the world. And then secondly, I don't want to put the cart before the horse, but net debt came down, you're almost within sight of that $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. Just your thoughts on timing for when we may hear some words on capital management and what you're potentially thinking if it's not too early?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Glyn, on the tariff discussion, I want to emphasize exactly how much advocacy and engagement we've been doing over the last 3 or 4 months. I've spent time in Ottawa. I've spent a lot of time in D.C. I have met with Mr. Hassett, Mr. Lutnick, Mr. Greer. I even had a very, very brief discussion with President Trump while I was in Saudi Arabia, and we're talking like a 15-second discussion with President Trump while I was in Saudi Arabia. And we're doing really 2 things. One is an underlying education of how short the U.S. market is for aluminum and how long it would take to replenish that via building plants in the U.S. And recall, and I know you know this, but building a smelter in the U.S. would probably take us at least 5 years in order to replace the 4 million metric tons of aluminum that comes outside of -- from outside of the U.S. We need 6 gigawatts of energy, that's not gigawatt hours, that's 6 gigawatts of energy. And it would probably cost $30 billion to put 4 million metric tons here. So we're educating the government on those facts. And then secondly, we're educating them on how tight the supply chains are between the U.S. and Canada and the fact that we think it makes a lot of sense to have metal coming out of Canada to support our downstream customers. And then there's one last data point. There's something like 12 or 13 jobs in the downstream that are supported by every Canadian primary upstream job. So the relationship between how much jobs can be created in the upstream is really outweighed by how many jobs there already are in the downstream processing business in the U.S. Do you want to address the capital flows?\nMolly S. Beerman: So Glyn, thanks for the question on the cap allocation. We made good progress this quarter on our adjusted net debt target. At the end of the second quarter, we were at $1.7 billion. That's an improvement from the $2.1 billion from the first quarter. We are about $200 million away from the high end of our target at $1.5 billion. While we reach the top end of the range, we will look across our capital allocation priorities, so returns to shareholders, portfolio actions as well as any growth opportunities. We do recognize that we have a bit more work to do inside the target. The adjusted debt, which we define as including the gross debt plus the pension is at $3.2 billion and that's above the high end of that range that we've targeted at $2.1 billion. So we will work on some delevering. We do have our 2027 notes, a portion of those remain about $141 million, those are now callable at par. We also have a portion of our 2028 notes that are now callable with a small premium. That's about $219 million. So we'll look at keeping in mind that our cash target is $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We'll work on some delevering.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for any closing remarks.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Thank you for joining our call. Molly and I look forward to sharing further progress when we speak again in October. That concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

      "transcript": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Alcoa Corporation Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Presentation and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Louis Langlois, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.\nLouis Langlois: Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, Alcoa Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly. As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted on this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Bill.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Thank you, Louis, and welcome to our second quarter 2025 earnings conference call. We delivered strong operational performance this quarter, both in terms of safety and stability. This is an important value driver for the company. We maintained a fast pace of execution on our priorities and continue to steer through changing market conditions. Let's begin with safety. Safety performance remained strong in the second quarter with no fatal or serious injuries reported. Injury rates continue to trend below our full year 2024 benchmarks, supported by a sustained emphasis on leader time in field. This initiative enables leaders to engage directly with teams, conduct safety observations and deliver both positive reinforcement and constructive feedback. We continued executing on our strategic priorities. On July 1, we closed the sale of our 25.1% stake in the Ma'aden joint ventures for a total value of $1.35 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion of Ma'aden shares and $150 million of cash. In late April, we successfully concluded a 5-year tax dispute in Australia with a favorable ruling for Alcoa. The Australian Review Tribunal affirmed our long-standing position, determining that no additional tax was owed. This outcome reflects the substantial effort and dedication of our internal and external legal and tax teams whose strong defense was instrumental in achieving this result. Throughout the quarter, we steered through frequent tariff updates that demanded agile decision- making and rapid adjustments across both sales and supply operations. We redirected portions of our Canadian production to serve non-U.S. customers to mitigate Section 232 tariff impacts. In parallel, we sustained active advocacy and engagement with policymakers on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border. Finally, our recent customer engagements continue to signal encouraging demand trends. We extended our supply agreement with Prysmian, a global leader in energy and telecom cable systems and completed our first North American sale of EcoLum, a value-added low-carbon product, further reinforcing our position as a supplier of choice for sustainable aluminum solutions. In summary, we delivered strong performance across the areas within our control while continuing to advocate for trade policies that support both Alcoa and the broader U.S. aluminum industry. Now I'll turn it over to Molly to take us through the financial results.\nMolly S. Beerman: Thank you, Bill. Revenue was down 10% sequentially to $3 billion. In the Alumina segment, third-party revenue decreased 28% on lower average realized third-party price, partially offset by increased shipments. In the Aluminum segment, third-party revenue increased 3% due to increased shipments and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by a decrease in average realized third-party price. While the Midwest premium increased during the quarter in response to the increase in U.S. tariffs, the increase was more than fully offset by lower LME, resulting in a decrease in the realized price of aluminum. Second quarter net income attributable to Alcoa was $164 million versus the prior quarter of $548 million, with earnings per common share decreasing to $0.62 per share. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to Alcoa was $103 million or $0.39 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $313 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. The sequential decrease in adjusted EBITDA of $542 million is primarily due to lower alumina and aluminum prices and increased U.S. Section 232 tariff costs on aluminum imported into the U.S. from our Canadian smelters. The Alumina segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $525 million, primarily due to lower alumina prices. In addition, higher production costs, energy costs and raw material costs were only partially offset by higher volumes. The Aluminum segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $37 million. While lower metal prices and unfavorable currency were more than offset by lower alumina costs, the segment was impacted by $95 million in U.S. Section 232 tariffs, which includes the increase in the tariff rate from 25% to 50% effective June 4. These impacts were only partially offset by price/mix improvements and higher volumes. Outside the segments, other corporate costs increased, while intersegment eliminations changed favorably due to lower average alumina price requiring less inventory profit elimination. Moving on to cash flow activities for the second quarter. We ended the quarter with cash of $1.5 billion. Cash from operations was positive again this quarter, providing $488 million, along with a working capital release of $251 million. Working capital decreased from the first quarter as accounts receivable came down with the lower prices for alumina. Subsequent to close of the second quarter, on July 1, we received approximately 86 million shares of Ma'aden and $150 million of cash for the sale of our interest in the Ma'aden joint ventures. The majority of the cash will be used to pay related taxes and transaction fees. Moving on to other key financial metrics. The year-to-date return on equity was positive at 22.5%. Days working capital was flat sequentially at 47 days. Our second quarter dividend added $27 million to stockholder capital returns. We had positive free cash flow for the quarter of $357 million. Turning to the outlook. We have 4 adjustments to our full year outlook. First, we are adjusting our annual outlook for aluminum shipments to 2.5 million to 2.6 million metric tons, down from our initial estimate of 2.6 million to 2.8 million metric tons. The change is due to reduced shipments from the San Ciprián smelter where the restart was disrupted by the nationwide power outage in April. As separately announced earlier this week, the joint venture has decided to resume the restart process in the third quarter. The reduction in aluminum shipments will primarily impact the third quarter due to the timing of the San Ciprián ramp-up. Second, we are lowering other corporate costs to $160 million from our initial estimate of $170 million due to reductions in corporate expenses and favorable currency impacts. Third, we are increasing our outlook for interest expense to $180 million from our prior estimate of $165 million due to unfavorable value-added tax assessments. And last, we have adjusted the return-seeking CapEx outlook for 2025 to $50 million, down from $75 million as the pace of spend has not matched the original forecast. For the third quarter of 2025, in the Alumina segment, we expect performance to improve by approximately $20 million with lower maintenance costs and higher production. In the Aluminum segment, we expect higher Midwest premium revenue in relation to the increased tariffs. Premium changes can be calculated from the sensitivities provided in the appendix. Those premium gains will be offset by approximately $90 million in sequential expense increase for tariff costs. With the increase in the U.S. Section 232 tariff rate from 25% to 50%, we expect quarterly tariff costs to approximate [ $215 million ] based on an LME of $2,600 and Midwest premium of $0.67 per pound. While costs related to the San Ciprián restart will be higher sequentially, they are not material, and we expect to cover with improvements in other operations. Alumina cost in the Aluminum segment is expected to be favorable by $100 million. Our updates exclude impacts from the recently announced tariffs on U.S. imports from Brazil. Below EBITDA, other expenses in the third quarter are expected to remain consistent with the second quarter. Based on last week's pricing, we expect third quarter operational tax expense of $50 million to $60 million. Tax expense in the third quarter is notably higher than the second quarter, which included a catch-up benefit to reflect the annualized effective tax rate when applied to year-to- date earnings. In the appendix to the earnings materials, you will see that our Midwest paid and Midwest unpaid premium sensitivities have been updated to reflect the expected trade flows as a result of additional tariff impacts. We also revised our regional premium distribution to align with our efforts to redirect tons and optimize margins. Currently, approximately 30% of our Canadian aluminum production is available for spot sales and can be redirected to customers outside the U.S. when the premium shipping and tariff netback calculations favor another destination. Additional updates to our sensitivities may be needed as we continue to adjust our trade flows to the tariff structure. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Thanks, Molly. While tariffs continue to drive near-term volatility, the broader outlook for aluminum demand remains robust. This slide illustrates Alcoa's long-term demand forecast underpinned by powerful global megatrends across key sectors. Transportation leads as the largest and fastest-growing sector, driven by the shift to electric vehicles, lightweighting initiatives and increased vehicle production. Construction shows more modest growth tempered by a slowdown in China, though emerging markets and favorable macroeconomic conditions like lower long-term interest rates and increased fiscal spending in Europe offer upside potential. Packaging is expanding rapidly, fueled by consumer preference for recyclable materials. Electrical demand is accelerating due to the global energy transition with aluminum playing a critical role in renewable power generation and grid modernization. Other sectors, including consumer durables and machinery and equipment are also expected to grow steadily. Importantly, the geography of growth is shifting. Primary aluminum demand is projected to grow significantly faster in markets outside China at a 3% CAGR from 2025 to 2030, while China's growth slows to just 0.2% CAGR, largely met by recycled metal. Within Alcoa's core regions, North America is expected to lead with a 3.8% CAGR and Europe is projected to grow at 1.5%. Three structural drivers underpin the overall aluminum growth trajectory. The green and digital transition. Aluminum is essential to electrification, decarbonization and digital infrastructure, supporting everything from electric vehicles to data centers. Second is the rise of developing economies, the China transition and reshoring in North America and Europe. As China's growth moderates, developing economies are stepping up. Meanwhile, reshoring in North America and Europe, often driven by trade policy continues to boost regional demand. Third, material substitution. Aluminum's recyclability and performance make it a preferred alternative to copper, plastics and other materials, especially in closed-loop systems. Despite short-term uncertainty, these megatrends provide a resilient and compelling road map for long-term aluminum demand growth. Now turning to our markets, starting with alumina. After a sharp decline during the first quarter, alumina prices rebounded somewhat in recent months. As noted in our previous earnings update, over 80% of Chinese refineries were operating at a deficit due to high bauxite prices and low alumina prices. In response, approximately 10 million metric tons of refining capacity in China was curtailed or reduced for maintenance during April and May. These production cuts contributed to a more balanced market and supported the price recovery seen in the second quarter. Looking ahead, market dynamics will continue to be shaped by capacity expansions in Indonesia, India and China. As new supply comes online, we anticipate further production cuts and plant maintenance in China may be necessary to maintain market balance in the second half of the year. On the bauxite front, prices have remained elevated due to supply uncertainty stemming from mining license withdrawals in Guinea. These disruptions could intensify with the onset of the rainy season, further tightening supply. In this dynamic environment, Alcoa's global refinery network continues to provide reliable aluminum supply to both our smelters and key customers. We're also capitalizing on high bauxite prices with our Juruti mine on track to achieve record sales volumes this year. Let's now move on to aluminum. LME prices dipped in April, coinciding with the reciprocal tariffs announced on April 2, but regained momentum over the course of the quarter. Despite this recovery, prices remained below first quarter levels, reflecting ongoing market volatility. U.S. Midwest premium initially surged in early June following the implementation of the 50% Section 232 tariffs, reaching $0.68 per pound and now stands at $0.67 as of late last week. This remains below analyst estimates of approximately $0.75 per pound to fully offset the tariff costs. The Midwest duty unpaid index calculated by subtracting the tariff from the duty paid premium has shown negative or near 0 values at times. This theoretical index only holds when the market is priced on marginal imports, which hasn't consistently been the case. In response, we sold over 100,000 metric tons of Canadian metal normally destined for the U.S. to non-U.S. customers since March, and we'll continue this strategy until the Midwest premium fully reflects the new tariff structure. From a demand perspective, conditions remained steady in both Europe and North America, although sector performance is mixed. Electrical and packaging continue to perform well. Construction appears to be stabilizing and automotive remains the most affected by tariff-related uncertainty. In China, easing trade tensions with the U.S. are providing a modest boost to demand. On the supply side, growth was limited in the second quarter with only marginal increases from smelter restarts and expansions. Global production remains constrained, particularly outside of China. Specific to Alcoa, in North America, our value-added product order book remains stable with strong demand for slab, billet and rod. In Europe, VAP volumes improved slightly in the second quarter with billet demand strengthening and rod and slabs demand holding firm. However, foundry orders softened in both regions, largely due to uncertainty in the automotive sector tied to tariff impacts. We are progressing the approvals for our next major mine regions in Western Australia, Myara North and Holyoake as well as our current mine plan, which had been referred by a third party. The 12-week public comment period for both approvals, which began in late May, is a statutory part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process. It enables individuals, communities and stakeholders to share input, raise concerns and recommendations for consideration. Concurrently, we are supporting the public comment period through a comprehensive communication and engagement campaign. The focus of the campaign is to ensure that the public has access to accurate information and facts about our environmental performance in Australia and understands our commitment to responsible mining in the Northern jarrah forest. Some key highlights include over 55 years of rehabilitation experience. Only 2% of the Northern jarrah forest has been cleared for mining. No mining in old growth forests, operations are limited to areas previously cleared for timber and 75% of cleared forest has been rehabilitated. The campaign also showcases the expertise and dedication of our Alcoa professionals who apply a science-based approach to biodiversity and rehabilitation. Given the complexity of advancing 2 mine approvals at the same time, the volume of documentation submitted by Alcoa and independent experts and the anticipated effort to review and respond to public submissions, the original time line for mine approvals is no longer feasible. While ministerial approval was initially targeted in the first quarter of 2026, it is now expected that the process will extend beyond that time frame. Following the public consultation period, we expect the Western Australia EPA will publish a revised time line. We remain committed to working collaboratively with the Western Australia EPA and other stakeholders to secure ministerial decisions as early as possible in 2026. In the meantime, we have developed multiple contingency plans and expect to continue accessing bauxite of similar grade until the new mine regions are operational. We will continue to engage with stakeholders to fulfill our responsibilities as a trusted miner and to sustain our right to mine for decades to come. To conclude, in the second quarter, Alcoa delivered strong safety results and operational performance in areas within our control. We also made meaningful progress on our strategic priorities. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing at pace across our 2025 priorities, enhancing operational competitiveness, navigating market dynamics to deliver long-term value for our stockholders and advancing the approval process for our Western Australian mine plans. With that, let's open the floor for questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets.\nKatja Jancic: Maybe starting on the tariff side. Molly, I think you mentioned that the current outlook doesn't include anything for potential, I guess, 50% tariffs on Brazil. How would -- if that does happen, is there any way you get impacted from that potentially?\nMolly S. Beerman: Katja, it depends on if alumina is indeed excluded. Our read of it now is that it's covered under the annex. But until we see the executive order that would be related to Brazil, we can't assure that. If that were the case, we are sourcing our U.S. smelters with Brazilian alumina. Now we could redirect supply and provide them from Western Australia, but obviously, that will take time and cost more in terms of shipping. But we have that option. And depending on how that executive order is written, we can adapt.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. And maybe just another question, Bill, on the Western Australia contingency plans. Can you discuss what some of those plants could be? And how could that impact your cost?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So at this point, as far as an impact on cost, we don't anticipate any impact in 2025 or 2026. The expectation that we would be into the new mine areas in late 2027 has now slipped out into 2028. We have a series of contingency plans that cover different mining areas, potentially going deeper in the pits that we're in that allow us to be comfortable that we are working through the process, and we'll get the right approvals.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Alex Hacking with Citi.\nAlexander Nicholas Hacking: Just following up on Katja's question there on WA. If the delays to the new mine areas are extended, can you keep mining the lower grade areas for a period of additional years? Or it would be more urgent than that?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So we'll continue to mine the areas that we're in today. And as I said to Katja, the -- no impact on '25, '26. As we said, we expect it to be in the new mines in late '27. That slips out till 2028 at this point, but we do have contingency plans in place that can go up to -- all the way up to a 15-month delay if needed.\nAlexander Nicholas Hacking: Okay. What if it's longer than 15 months?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: We'll work through that, and we'll look at what implications it has on operating rates in Pinjarra, but we'll work through that when we get there.\nAlexander Nicholas Hacking: Okay. And then just following up on the tariff maths. I mean, Molly, you mentioned that I think it was $215 million a quarter in Section 232 cost. Is that being more than offset by what you're getting on the additional Midwest premium at the moment?\nMolly S. Beerman: Yes. Alex, let me give you the numbers of what we experienced for the second quarter. So if you look at -- in our bridge discussion, we talked about the tariffs being $95 million more in the second quarter. That's on top of the $20 million that we paid in the first quarter. So the cost in the second quarter was about $115 million. We only saw a Midwest premium uptick of about $60 million. So we had margin compression of about $55 million, and that's related to our Canadian tons. Now obviously, we're getting a benefit on our U.S. tons, but I'm giving you the compression that we felt on the Canadian.\nAlexander Nicholas Hacking: Sorry, the $60 million additional, is that -- that's just on the Canadian tons or that includes the U.S. tons?\nMolly S. Beerman: Just on the Canadian tons. If you look at -- so Alex, let me just give you a little bit more color. If you look at the pricing today, so it's LME at $2,600 and Midwest premium at $0.67 a pound, we are near neutral or even slightly positive if you look at the volumes as a whole because the higher uptick in Midwest premium on the U.S. tons would be more than the net negative on our Canadian tons. So that's at this current pricing. If this were to hold from a whole year perspective, we would be about neutral to slightly positive.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: And the one point that we continue to make is and I think other analysts that follow the space make it, the current Midwest doesn't support the overall tariff costs coming out of Canada. So current -- Midwest is sitting at $0.67, $0.68. We think it needs to be between $0.70 and $0.75 depending on how you look at it to cover total tariff costs. And that's why we have moved -- repositioned metal going that was expected to go into the U.S. that is now going into destinations outside of the U.S. just because that math doesn't work currently. And anywhere we can take advantage of that, we will and move tons for other destinations.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Daniel Major with UBS.\nDaniel Edward Major: Just very quick first one. Just to clarify the maths on the tariff costs, you had $115 million cost in the second quarter, and you said it's going to be a negative $90 million delta. So it's $205 million the run rate of cost in the second quarter. Is that correct?\nMolly S. Beerman: That will be the third quarter cost, yes, $205 million. And then we're saying again at latest pricing. So if you dialed forward, that would be the $215 million that we guided to in tariff cost.\nDaniel Edward Major: Sorry, you said latest pricing, you mean spot pricing or like...\nMolly S. Beerman: Yes. Sorry. The $205 million is what we gave as the outlook for the third quarter. So that's a $90 million sequential change. And then we were also saying that our quarterly tariff cost at today's pricing is $215 million.\nDaniel Edward Major: Got it. Clear. That's very good. Yes. Then second question just on San Ciprián. You updated the respective net income drag and cash burn this year. Can you give us any sense of expectations for 2026 at this point? My guess would be the refinery will continue to burn cash. But is there any guidance you can give on either the cash burn or [ not ] at the smelter and the refinery?\nMolly S. Beerman: Yes, Daniel, we're not giving the guide there yet, but you're right. At recent market prices, the Spanish operations are challenged. From the smelter, the delay to the restart after the power outage has driven the full ramp-up into '26. We do expect after full ramp-up that the smelter will be profitable, but the refinery -- while having a first quarter '25 income, they will move into a loss position for the rest of the year, and they will struggle still at this API level into '26.\nDaniel Edward Major: Okay. But at spot, you can confirm that the smelter would be cash neutral?\nMolly S. Beerman: The smelter had fully ramped up a level would be profitable.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: But remember, it won't be fully ramped up in 2026. I mean it will hit the -- our anticipation is that it will hit the ramp-up schedule for 2026. But for the full year, it still will -- it will be going through the process of ramping up.\nMolly S. Beerman: We won't be fully ramped up until midyear '26.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Nick Giles with B. Riley.\nHenry Hearle: This is Henry Hearle on for Nick Giles today. So on our estimates, you have about 50,000 metric tons of spare annual capacity at Warrick and the Midwest premium has increased sharply to reflect that tariffs may be stickier than originally thought. So my math, the spare capacity at Warrick could generate over $100 million of EBITDA annually. And so what prevents you guys from restarting this capacity today?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Thanks for the question, and it's a great question. We're currently running 3 lines at Warrick. We have a fourth line at Warrick that would produce approximately 50,000 tons. The issue in Warrick is that, that fourth line needs a lot of work and will take some time to get restarted. So our estimate is that it would be about $100 million investment to restart that fourth line, and it would take us about a year to get it up and running. So we will certainly continue to run the numbers on Warrick. We would need to ensure that the tariffs will stick around for quite a while given that ramp-up curve in Warrick before we made the decision of investing another $100 million in a restart in Warrick.\nHenry Hearle: That definitely makes sense. Continued best of luck.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan.\nWilliam Chapman Peterson: On the mid-2026 restart of San Ciprián, it still implies 75% utilization. Can you remind us of, I guess, when the term of the agreement with the workforce comes to [ an end ] and whether the delayed restart has any impact on that?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So after -- Bill, thanks for the question. After the power outage occurred in Spain, we declared force majeure with -- on that contract because it limited our ability to be able to meet the deadlines that are included in the contract. Recall that we had anticipated a full restart by October 1 of 2020 -- sorry, 2025. And then from there, we had some flexibility on how we run the plant after that full restart. Because of the power outage, we have said that we were not going to meet that October 1 deadline, and we've moved it back to the middle part of 2026.\nWilliam Chapman Peterson: Okay. And then kind of a different angle on the tariffs. And last quarter, I asked you about conversations with the U.S. government. But I guess in light of the tariffs remaining where they are now, how should we think about the commercial strategy, things like tariff cost sharing? And maybe perhaps you can share additional color on your shifting flows to non-U.S. customers. How should we think about that in the coming months? And then finally, is there any opportunities from relief from the Canadian government in the meantime?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So we have had extensive conversations on both sides of the border. I've been talking to the Carney administration often. I've been talking to the U.S. administration often. And at a 50% tariff, you saw us take action to redirect 100,000 tons to non-U.S. customers. As Molly said in her prepared remarks, we have the ability of about 30% of the Canadian volume to be able to redirect that to non-U.S. destination. And we will do so as long as the netbacks make more sense to ship it to other places than the U.S. So we've been very dynamic and handled this situation very quickly, and we'll continue to do so in the future. I felt like that was a multipart question. Did I miss any [indiscernible]\nWilliam Chapman Peterson: Yes. Just anything on tariff cost sharing that you might add?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Well, when you say tariff cost sharing, we -- through the Midwest premium, the Midwest premium is largely passing on the higher tariffs to our customers. So just to be clear, we are saying the Midwest premium needs to be, let's say, $0.75 to fully cover the tariffs. We're able to pass through 90% of that through a higher Midwest premium to our customers. So while we're not particularly thrilled with the tariffs, our customers are paying significantly higher prices for aluminum in the United States than they would pay anywhere else in the world.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChristopher LaFemina: It might be a dumb question, but isn't it the case that the tariffs are really just a net neutral for you? Because if you're diverting tons away from the U.S. because you can get better prices elsewhere, the Midwest premium goes up. And unless the Midwest premium is high enough for you to sell to the U.S., well, then you want to sell there. And at the end of the day, it's really -- I mean, in equilibrium, it should be a net neutral. And it's the customers in the U.S. will pay the premium. But I'm not really sure why the guidance should be for any net impact other than if you only consider where Midwest premium is today and where the LME price is today. But over time, shouldn't it be a wash? That's my first question.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So let me address this, and Molly can certainly feel free to jump in. With all the numbers that Molly gave us earlier in the call, in the end, if the Midwest premium reacts accordingly, it's a net neutral to Alcoa. However, there's a big however there. Our customers in the U.S. are seeing significantly higher prices than anywhere else in the world. And if you assume that they can pass that on to their customers, then I get the net neutral to them, but somebody ends up eating that tariff cost. And there are dedicated supply chains from Canada to our customers, literally trains that go from door to door from our plants to our customers that our belief is that it makes the most sense for the industry to have metal being able to flow from Canada to the U.S. with either a lower tariff or no tariff at all. And so -- and that's the best thing we think for our customers and for our industry to be able to do that.\nChristopher LaFemina: Right. So in that case, the impact of the tariffs is really on total demand, in which case, LME prices would go down. But the net impact -- I mean, other than the overall kind of price -- global LME price impact, the impact on Alcoa should still be neutral, right? Because either way, the Midwest premium has got to equal the tariffs over time.\nMolly S. Beerman: Chris, you have to remember that we do have customer contracts. So we don't have full flexibility to move the metal dynamically. So 70% of our Canadian metal is on contract, so that needs to flow into the U.S. for customer commitment.\nChristopher LaFemina: Okay. And then sorry, just a second question on the ATO, which I think you had $225 million in taxes now by the middle of next year. Is any of that provisioned on the balance sheet yet? How do we think about the kind of cash flow impact of that and the balance sheet impact of that?\nMolly S. Beerman: Yes. That is fully reserved on the balance sheet now as a tax payable.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: And Chris, I'm just going to add to that, and I can't help myself. That is a major win for Alcoa. That was a large overhang on the company and on the stock. We have been battling that for 5 years now. And to get that behind us is a really big deal. And I'll give some credit to our tax and legal team here that stuck with it and really presented a great case. So I'm pleased that we're able to put that behind us.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.\nCarlos De Alba: Just on the last point you made, Molly, that 70% of your Canadian smelting output is under contract to be sold to U.S. customers. When does -- when can you start renegotiating potentially those contracts so that, that 70% decreases?\nMolly S. Beerman: So those are annual contracts, but also understand we have firm customer relationships that we're not going to jeopardize. So Carlos, you could see some flexibility, but it's going to be a careful balance of respecting our strong customer relations as well as moving the metal to get the best margin.\nCarlos De Alba: All right. Okay. And if I may, just on the progress on the Alumar smelter in Brazil. What is the capacity utilization at which you are running? And when do you expect to get sort of a steady state?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So we continue to struggle with the Alumar restart. And we're sitting at about 92% capacity today. So net-net, we moved a little bit forward over the last quarter. The issue there, Carlos, is some of the patch pots that we had not anticipated having to reline are failing faster than what we had anticipated. So it's a battle. We take, I would say, a step and a half forward and a step backward just about every day in Alumar. And we're anticipating that we'll have that restarted completely this year. However, I've told you that before. And I think we're -- that's my target, but I've missed my target before. So take that with a grain of salt.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Lawson Winder with Bank of America.\nLawson Winder: Bill and Molly, thank you for today's update. Just wanted to follow up on the Ma'aden closing. And whether there's any new thinking on the potential to monetize that amount or even just simply lower your overall borrowing cost using that as collateral?\nMolly S. Beerman: Lawson, while we have the option to monetize those shares during the lockup period, recall the lockup period, we cannot sell shares until the third, fourth and fifth anniversary, [ the third ] each year. But to monetize those would be complex transactions, and that would be classified as debt on our balance sheet, and that might not really be a cost-effective source of liquidity either. While we don't expect to hold the shares for an extended period of time after each lockup period expires, we don't have plans to monetize and advance. Right now, we don't have a specific use for the cash that would [ have ] us add that debt to our balance sheet.\nLawson Winder: And then as you report those gains and losses going forward, I assume you'll be adjusting those out?\nMolly S. Beerman: Yes. So it will be mark-to-market, and you'll see special items to remove that from our regular operations.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.\nJohn Charles Tumazos: I'm curious as to the confidence you have in Spain restarting this week that the utility will deliver electricity. Presumably, the population grows something like 10% July, August with tourism. And then there's air conditioning, electricity demand in the heat of the summer. So are there any guarantees of power delivery or something that's different than August 28 when the wind didn't blow?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: So John, it's a question that we've been wrestling with since the wind didn't blow on the date earlier in the year. We've been working with the national and regional representatives of the country, and they have developed, and this is obviously not just our prompting, but prompting from other industry. In Spain, they've approved a list of 65 actions in the energy sector that are designed to make the electricity grid more resilient. They are incorporating additional tools in the networks like voltage control, working on stability in the face of oscillations. So they are working to strengthen the electrical systems. There's no guarantees in life, and -- but they are taking, we believe, the right measures to ensure that the power stays on.\nJohn Charles Tumazos: As you start up Monday, the 14th, how many pots per week do you energize? Is the circumstance in late July and August where you're really not drawing very much electricity because of the gradual nature of the process?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Yes. So it's a gradual ramp-up process, and we should hit the target by the middle part of next year. My recollection is there's 500 pots in Spain. So we'll be starting -- you can do the math on how many pots we have to start to hit total production by the middle part of next year. But yes, we'll be starting a few pots a week to get to that restart done.\nOperator: And your next question today will come from Glyn Lawcock with Barrenjoey.\nGlyn Lawcock: Firstly, Bill, just wondering if you could share any thoughts on how discussions with the government are going regarding the tariff. I had heard that maybe Canada could be in line for a reduction relative to the rest of the world. And then secondly, I don't want to put the cart before the horse, but net debt came down, you're almost within sight of that $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. Just your thoughts on timing for when we may hear some words on capital management and what you're potentially thinking if it's not too early?\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Glyn, on the tariff discussion, I want to emphasize exactly how much advocacy and engagement we've been doing over the last 3 or 4 months. I've spent time in Ottawa. I've spent a lot of time in D.C. I have met with Mr. Hassett, Mr. Lutnick, Mr. Greer. I even had a very, very brief discussion with President Trump while I was in Saudi Arabia, and we're talking like a 15-second discussion with President Trump while I was in Saudi Arabia. And we're doing really 2 things. One is an underlying education of how short the U.S. market is for aluminum and how long it would take to replenish that via building plants in the U.S. And recall, and I know you know this, but building a smelter in the U.S. would probably take us at least 5 years in order to replace the 4 million metric tons of aluminum that comes outside of -- from outside of the U.S. We need 6 gigawatts of energy, that's not gigawatt hours, that's 6 gigawatts of energy. And it would probably cost $30 billion to put 4 million metric tons here. So we're educating the government on those facts. And then secondly, we're educating them on how tight the supply chains are between the U.S. and Canada and the fact that we think it makes a lot of sense to have metal coming out of Canada to support our downstream customers. And then there's one last data point. There's something like 12 or 13 jobs in the downstream that are supported by every Canadian primary upstream job. So the relationship between how much jobs can be created in the upstream is really outweighed by how many jobs there already are in the downstream processing business in the U.S. Do you want to address the capital flows?\nMolly S. Beerman: So Glyn, thanks for the question on the cap allocation. We made good progress this quarter on our adjusted net debt target. At the end of the second quarter, we were at $1.7 billion. That's an improvement from the $2.1 billion from the first quarter. We are about $200 million away from the high end of our target at $1.5 billion. While we reach the top end of the range, we will look across our capital allocation priorities, so returns to shareholders, portfolio actions as well as any growth opportunities. We do recognize that we have a bit more work to do inside the target. The adjusted debt, which we define as including the gross debt plus the pension is at $3.2 billion and that's above the high end of that range that we've targeted at $2.1 billion. So we will work on some delevering. We do have our 2027 notes, a portion of those remain about $141 million, those are now callable at par. We also have a portion of our 2028 notes that are now callable with a small premium. That's about $219 million. So we'll look at keeping in mind that our cash target is $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We'll work on some delevering.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for any closing remarks.\nWilliam F. Oplinger: Thank you for joining our call. Molly and I look forward to sharing further progress when we speak again in October. That concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

By pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Louis Langlois, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nLouis Langlois: Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, our Alcoa Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer, and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly.\nWilliam Oplinger: As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are intended in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted on this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Louis, and welcome to our first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Alcoa had strong first-quarter financial and production results. We maintained a fast pace of execution on our priorities despite economic uncertainty while progressing operational excellence through safety, stability, and continuous improvement. Underlying the strength of our performance were positive market conditions. Let's start with safety. First and foremost, a strong safety culture supports operational excellence. We had no fatal or serious injuries in the first quarter, and we continue to improve our safety performance. Operational stability is shown by solid production, where the majority of our operations improved sequentially on a tons-per-day basis. We also continued to improve stability at the Alumar smelter in Brazil, currently operating at approximately 91% capacity. We completed a $1 billion debt offering in Australia using most of the proceeds to repay existing debt. The new debt has extended the maturities at a lower after-tax interest expense than our previously outstanding debt. Lastly, we formed a joint venture with Ignis EQT for our San Ciprian operations and are now resuming production at the smelter in accordance with the viability agreement. Now I'll turn it over to Molly to take us through the strong financial results.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you, Bill. Revenue was down 3% sequentially, to $3.4 billion. In the Alumina segment, third-party revenue decreased 8% on lower average realized third-party price and lower shipments due to timing and decreased trading. In the aluminum segment, third-party revenue was flat due to an increase in the average realized third-party price offset by lower shipments in the first quarter after strong sales in the fourth quarter of 2024. First-quarter net income attributable to Alcoa was $548 million versus the prior quarter of $202 million with earnings per common share more than doubling to $2.07 per share. The sequential improvement reflects increased aluminum prices and lower intersegment profit elimination, partially offset by increased alumina costs and tariffs on our Canadian aluminum imported into the United States for U.S. customers. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to Alcoa was $568 million or $2.15 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $178 million to $855 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. First-quarter adjusted EBITDA reflects higher aluminum prices and lower intersegment profit elimination which more than offset lower aluminum prices. Lower volume, increases in raw material and energy prices, and higher production costs were more than offset by improvements in price mix and other costs. Lower volume in the first quarter was expected after a strong fourth-quarter shipping schedule. Mainly alumina from our Australian refineries. Other costs primarily relate to intersegment elimination. The Aluminum segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $52 million primarily due to lower alumina prices, lower volume, and unfavorable currency impacts only partially offset by favorable production costs and other costs. The aluminum segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $60 million with higher metal prices and favorable currency more than offset by higher alumina costs and higher production, energy, raw material, and other costs. Included in other costs are approximately $20 million for U.S. Section 232 tariffs of 25% on aluminum imports from Canada which became effective on March 12. Outside the segment, other corporate costs decreased and the intersegment elimination expense decreased as expected with significantly lower average alumina price requiring less inventory profit elimination. Moving on to cash flow activities for the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with cash of $1.2 billion. Strong EBITDA led to positive cash from operations in the first quarter despite high consumption of cash for working capital build which is typical in our first quarter period. Working capital increased as inventories in both segments rose. In alumina, on higher raw material price and volume, and in aluminum on timing of raw material and aluminum shipments. Accounts payable decreased following elevated alumina trading payables in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we progressed our objective to reposition debt and delever with the issuance of $1 billion of debt in Australia and the tender of $890 million related to our outstanding 2027 and 2028 notes. It is our intention to continue to delever with an initial focus on the remainder of the 2027 notes. Moving on to other key financial metrics. The year-to-date return on equity was positive at 39.1%. Days working capital increased 13 days sequentially to 47 days. The same level year over year, but elevated from our year-end 2024 low. Our first-quarter dividend added $26 million to stockholder capital reach. We had positive free cash flow plus net non-controlling interest contributions for the quarter, includes the €25 million contribution from Ignis EQT related to the San Ciprian joint venture formation. Proceeds from the debt issuance in Australia less debt tendered added $95 million to the ending cash balance of $1.2 billion. As we turn to the next slide, I would like to share an update on our capital allocation target. Our overall capital allocation framework remains unchanged. It starts with maintaining a strong balance sheet throughout the cycle, and sufficiently funding our operations to sustain and improve them. The optimal capital structure for our company is reached when investment-grade leverage metrics are achieved reducing our WACC and creating value for our stockholders through a higher company valuation lower cost of financing and improved project viability. We want to maintain investment-grade leverage metrics throughout all business cycles not only at the mid or top part of the cycle. Based on this, we first defined a target for adjusted debt which includes pension and OPEB liabilities. This target is $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion. Then considering our historical use rate of cash, we target a cash balance between $1 million and $1.5 million. Netting the cash with the adjusted debt, results in our targeted range of adjusted net debt of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We believe this range fits our profile and anticipated use of leverage as a company. I want to clarify that we are not committing to receiving and or maintaining investment-grade credit ratings. The credit ratings are assessed by the rating agencies. We want to maintain the flexibility to raise additional debt for strategic upper at any point in the cycle. Our adjusted net debt was $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. As we get closer to the $1 billion to $1.5 billion target, we will look at all of our capital allocation priorities including cash returns to stockholders and parallel to paying down debt. Turning to the outlook. We have one adjustment to our full-year outlook. We are updating depreciation expense from $640 million to $620 million due primarily to favorable currency impact. For the second quarter of 2025, in the Alumina segment, we expect to maintain the strong level of performance delivered in the first quarter. In the aluminum segment, we expect performance to be unfavorable by approximately $105 million due to U.S. Section 232 tariff costs on imports of our Canadian aluminum. Increasing approximately $90 million sequentially. As well as operating costs associated with the restart of the San Ciprian smelter of approximately $15 million. Aluminum cost in the aluminum segment expected to be favorable by $165 million. For intersegment eliminations with the current market volatility, we recommend that you use the low end of the sensitivity range in your model. Below EBITDA, within other expenses, quarter. The first quarter included favorable impacts of $20 million due to foreign currency gains, which may not recur. Based on last week's pricing, we expect second-quarter operational tax to be a benefit of $50 million to $60 million which includes timing and catch-up adjustments related to lower alumina prices. In the appendix to the earnings material, you will see that our Midwest paid and Midwest unpaid premium sensitivities have been updated to reflect the expected trade flows as a result of tariff impacts. We also revised our regional premium distribution for your reference. Updates to the Midwest premium do not include the cost component of the tariffs. There is a new column on the sensitivity slide for the tariff cost impact which will appear in the other bar of our EBITDA bridge. Since the second quarter will be the first full quarter of tariffs, you should consider a quarterly tariff cost of approximately $105 million as a baseline calculated based on an LME of $2,400 and a Midwest premium of $0.39 per pound. We will update our sensitivities as needed our trade flows adjust to the tariff structure. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Molly. Let me take the opportunity to speak to the current status of U.S. Tariffs applicable to the aluminum industry from Alcoa's perspective. The U.S. section 232 tariff structure has been in place for some time, in March, the tariff increased from 10% to 25% and the exemption for Canadian metal imported into the U.S. was removed. This is the most material impact on Alcoa. As approximately 70% of our aluminum produced in Canada is destined for U.S. customers. We are now subject to 25% tariff cost, which totals an estimated $400 to $425 million annually. Of course, there is a higher Midwest premium, which offsets some of this cost and certainly benefits our U.S. smelters but currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business. Next are the IEEPA tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. Since our aluminum products and the majority of our input materials from Canada and Mexico qualify under the USMCA provisions, Alcoa does not have a significant impact from this tariff at this time. The reciprocal tariffs specifically exclude Canada and Mexico, as well as aluminum products already subject to Section 232 tariffs. So no impact on Alcoa's aluminum sales. While alumina and other raw materials are excluded from the is now subject to the high reciprocal tariff. We expect these tariffs will increase our input cost by $10 to $15 million annually as there are no suitable replacement suppliers. In 2024, the U.S. imported approximately 4.2 million metric tons of primary aluminum, with imports of Canadian aluminum representing approximately 70% or 2.9 million metric tons. The four operating slippers in the U.S. produce 700,000 metric tons of aluminum each year, If all idle smelting capacity in the U.S. would restart, which approximately 600,000 metric tons, the U.S. would still be short by 3.6 million metric tons. It takes many years to build a new smelter and at least five to six smelters would be required to address the U.S. demand for primary aluminum. These new smelters would require additional energy production equivalent to almost seven new nuclear reactors. Or more than ten Hoover dams. Until additional smelting capacity is built in the U.S., the most efficient aluminum supply chain is Canadian aluminum flowing into the U.S. That being said, our global smelting portfolio and commercial experience give us options to shift metal supply as needed if trade policies and economics warrant. We've operated for more than 135 years in the aluminum industry. Building on our experience, we will continue our engagement efforts with the U.S. government and policymakers to advocate for the best outcome possible. Now let's discuss our market. In alumina, after reaching an all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2024, alumina prices declined in the first quarter of 2025. This was due to relatively higher liquidity, mainly driven by the Chinese refinery ramp-ups and normalized production outside China following several disruptions last year. As well as more recent alumina price declines on softened sentiment given global market uncertainty. The market has resolved most of the issues leading to a tightness in 2024, there is still uncertainty about the timing of the planned refinery ramp-ups in Indonesia and India this year. With bauxite prices remaining relatively high, and the current lower alumina price, we estimate that over 80% of Chinese refineries are unprofitable. Additionally, a recent announcement by the Chinese government stated that there would be higher scrutiny on new alumina projects regarding air pollution control, off-site sourcing, and red mud processing, which could bring additional constraints on growth in Chinese alumina production and may accelerate curtailment. This is a dynamic market and Alcoa's global network of refineries provides security and supply of alumina both to Alcoa smelters and our major customers which are primarily in the milli. A final point to highlight here is the opportunity we had in the first quarter to capitalize on tightness in the Bauxite market. The high prices in the first quarter, we participated in the spot markets capture benefits for some volumes from our joint venture in Guinea. Let's move on to Alimida. The LME aluminum price was generally resilient in the first quarter even with the decreasing aluminum price. With tariff announcements earlier this month, the LME responded by turning lower reflecting the uncertainty of the impact of tariffs on the global economy and aluminum market. The Midwest premium increased with the introduction of tariffs, it has not reached the $880 to $990 per ton level, which analysts predict supports shipments from any region to the U.S. Logistics still favor shipments from Canada to the U.S. compared to other potential major suppliers. In our view, the Midwest premium has not fully responded due to the uncertain mark settlement as well as inventory build in the U.S. ahead of the tariffs. The depletion of these inventories should trigger some upward response. Despite the uncertainty caused by the U.S. tariffs, there were some supportive signs on the demand side in the first quarter. Namely the Chinese stimulus and European fiscal loosening. Aluminum supply growth in the first quarter was very limited as smelter ramp-ups were offset by the effect of closures that took place at the end of last year. North America, our aluminum value-add product shipment volumes increased both sequentially and year over year with healthy demand for slab, billet, and rod. However, it is difficult to say whether our customers were anticipating tariffs and therefore buying in advance. In Europe, there were slightly lower VAT volumes in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, but up year over year with strong demand for rod and slab and billet demand finally improving. For both regions, we saw the negative impact of tariffs in our foundry order book which is closely tied with the automotive market and faces the largest amount of uncertainty from the tariff impact. Turning to Spain, we recently announced the formation of the joint venture with Ignis EQT support the continued operation of the San Ciprian complex. The idle smoking capacity is now being restarted to meet our obligation under the viability agreement, which was signed with our workforce when we curtailed the smelter in 2021, due to exorbitant energy prices. We are now focused on safely restarting the idle capacity. We will focus on repeating the strong operational results delivered in the first quarter. However, we are now adding the challenge of navigating uncertainty in our markets. A good time to consider the actions we've taken both recently and in the past to be well positioned to address adversity and capture opportunity. As a pure-play aluminum company, vertically integrated from mine to metal with a global footprint and cost-effective portfolio of assets, Alcoa has the ability to maneuver and respond to challenging and changing markets and policies. Security of supply through long-term contracts is valued by our customers. We also have the most comprehensive low-carbon product portfolio in the aluminum industry to meet customer needs. The company has a significant cash balance a strong capital structure, with no near-term debt maturities or other obligations requiring significant cash outlays beyond normal operations. We've taken strategic actions that strengthened the company over time including the recent acquisition of Alumina Limited and the announcement of the sale of the Modern Joint Ventures. Which is expected to close in the second quarter. We have a track record of monetizing non-core assets including transformation sites, which drive value for our stockholders. We also executed initiatives to be more cost-effective as demonstrated by our over-delivering our $645 million profitability program last year. These competitive advantages and actions support Alcoa's resilience. In summary, as we close up the presentation, Alcoa had a strong first quarter with improved safety and stable production. As a company, we made good progress on strategic actions. Looking ahead, we plan to maintain a fast pace of execution on our 2025 key areas of focus and strategic initiatives, improve the competitiveness of our operations, and navigate market challenges to deliver value to our stockholders. Operator, let's start the question and answer portion of the session.\nOperator: Our first question today is from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTimna Tanners: Yes. Good evening. Hope you're all well. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the tariff math if we could. I know that we heard from Molly a $105 million quarterly hit, and then I heard another $100 million from Bill. I just want to make sure I understood the distinction there. And I know in the past, Molly had talked about tens of millions of impact. I think that was assuming a higher Midwest premium, but just was hoping for a bit more clarification, please.\nMolly Beerman: Hi, Timna. So the first $100 million that we talked about, the negative $100 million to our overall business, that is when you consider we are getting a higher Midwest premium on our U.S. tons that brings a value of about $95 million. We'll also get a higher value within our Canadian asset sale, sorry, Canadian metal sales. It's into the U.S., that's $222 million. But going against that is the $400 million that Bill spoke of the cost of the Canadian tariff. So that met to the $100 million, and that's for the year. So that is a net number the revenue considered against the tariff cost. When I spoke of the $105 million, that is a quarterly figure, that $105 million is calculated based on an LME of $2,400 and a Midwest premium of $0.39. And those are the same assumptions that are in the first $100 million for the company as a whole. When we spoke to Timna about the impact earlier, we were using different Midwest premium assumptions. We had expected that the Midwest premium would respond more quickly, it is not. It is still down from what we would hope. We see that because of the negative sentiment in the market, as well as the fact that some tons did get stockpiled in inventory in the U.S. ahead of the tariff. And until that stockpile depletes, we don't have the impetus for price pressure up.\nTimna Tanners: Understood. That's helpful. And then my follow-up on tip again would be any updated thoughts on the stickiness of these tariffs? And if sticky, do you think about restarting Warwick in what timeframe? Thanks a lot.\nWilliam Oplinger: Timna, thanks for the question. Hard to make a restart decision based on a tariff that can change and I really can't comment on the stickiness because we've seen the volatility of discussions around the tariffs over the last 60 days. So, yeah, we just don't know whether they will stick. And we wouldn't necessarily make a decision to restart capacity simply based on tariffs. Just because they can change.\nTimna Tanners: Understood. Thanks again.\nOperator: The next question is from William Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Peterson: Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe following up on the tariffs a bit. So you talk about engaging with governments, policymakers, you know, U.S. and abroad. But can you provide, I guess, additional color on the level of engagement, who made Trump and maybe you know, Canadian administrations you're dealing with? And I guess, are you going at it alone as Alcoa or partnership with other aluminum companies or maybe potentially customers? Your products? I'm asking the second part of the context of some competitors either with larger portion of domestic production or even, like, Middle Eastern competitors that are evidently announcing intentions to build U.S. capacity. I'm basically wondering are there are there some in the administration that are sympathetic to your arguments that the U.S. really isn't gonna be able to close the gap anytime soon?\nWilliam Oplinger: William, so it's a wide-ranging question. I'll give you a wide-ranging answer. We are engaging with both the U.S. government and the Canadian government we're doing that as Alcoa. We're also doing that through the U.S. Aluminum Association. We have met either through ourselves or through the association with a number of President Trump's direct reports. And the message is fairly simple. The message is that the U.S. imports a lot of its primary aluminum. And that in order to support the downstream processing jobs, we need to have economic upstream aluminum production that can come in through preferably through Canada, but through other countries. We've met with the Canadian government both the outgoing prime minister, Mr. Trudeau, also the current prime minister of Mr. Carney, and have had very good discussions there. So a lot of engagement both through us and the aluminum association and the way I would characterize it is that and I and I should say it's been with the administration. It's been with the house members. It's also been with the senate and senators. I would characterize it that people are listening to us. They're understanding the situation. And we'll see where we get to. But it has been at least a reception to the message that we've provided.\nWilliam Peterson: Oh, yeah. Thanks for that. Thanks for those insights. And then, you know, you had the cost curve on alumina, but I'm wondering where alumina pricing is tracking today. As well as, you know, potentially challenging fundamental backdrop ahead do you think the marginal cost support of aluminum stands today globally?\nWilliam Oplinger: As of today, as I said in my prepared remarks, over 80% of the Chinese refining system is underwater. And so we believe that there's good support level at today's pricing. We just saw today, in know, this is very recent news, that alumina prices came back up overnight by $17. So, you know, it feels like there's some support at the levels that it's at. Now that is all based on, bauxite pricing. And bauxite pricing has been strong through the first three and a half months of the year. And it still sits at $80 to $85 a ton bauxite pricing and that is support for alumina cost.\nWilliam Peterson: Thanks, Scott.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, William. The next question is from Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChris LaFemina: Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on San Ciprian. So the slide that you have here, you talk about the impact on 2025 and then also the hedging strategy. You've deployed it to mitigate financial risk from 2025 to 2027. So if we're looking at don't know, $100 million to $120 million of negative cash flow from the restart of the smelter in 2025, what happens beyond 2025? How do the hedges help? And then secondly, I think there was, you know, the guidance had been that if you burn through roughly $200 million at San Ciprian comes to a point where you just can't continue to subsidize this? And does this hedging strategy that you refer to here protect you from that over the 2025 to 2027 period?\nMolly Beerman: First, I'll take this one. Fortunately, we did start to put the hedges in place several weeks ago, and we have secured hedge pricing that will help us to manage the cost within the funding envelope. We are focused year by year on 2025. We released the guidance for the smelter. We expect to lose about $70 million to $90 million in EBITDA. The cash used by those operations will be about $90 million to $110 million. The CapEx that we referred to is already included in our CapEx guidance.\nWilliam Oplinger: It's important to remember also that a portion of that CapEx, we would need to spend anyway. A portion of that CapEx is going toward the raise of the refinery Red Bud Lake that no matter whether we were running it or not, we would need to be able to make that because it also assists us in the final closure of that Red Muttling.\nChris LaFemina: Right. And could you quantify what the EBITDA impact would be in 2026 if you assume that prices don't change? I mean, how much of that $70 million to $90 million negative impact in 2025 is a function of restart and kind of other one-off costs that I'm not going to repeat? And also much of that is protected by tariffs and sorry, by your hedging in 2026? In other words, is this going to be $70 million to $90 million a year or is it going to be a lot less than that in terms of the loss in 2026, if we assume prices don't change?\nMolly Beerman: The smelter losses are heavier in 2025 because we have the inefficient of the restarts. We've not yet released the 2026 numbers, Chris. We'll look to do that as we get closer to the end of the year.\nChris LaFemina: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Nick Giles with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nNick Giles: Thanks, operator. Good evening, everyone. My first question was, you mentioned the higher scrutiny on future alumina production in China. But if 80% are unprofitable today what do you think it will ultimately take for Chinese aluminum refineries to curtail output?\nWilliam Oplinger: We're seeing part of it today already. The Chinese, in my history in the industry. And so we're seeing it today with maintenance outages, extended maintenance outages. So, you know, I really believe that they will react quickly to loss-making sites.\nNick Giles: Thanks for that, Bill. And then maybe just a follow-up there. You mentioned spot bauxite opportunities in one q, and so with the lower alumina prices but bauxite prices remaining more resilient. Could it make sense to reduce alumina production and sell more bauxite directly to Chinese?\nWilliam Oplinger: I think the economics would be really, really difficult to do that. And the reason why I say that is the marginal tons that you run through the refinery are generally pretty low cost. And so I don't believe and I don't I haven't looked at the numbers recently. But I don't believe it would support curtailing refining capacity to sell bauxite into China. So I just don't think that would solve at this point.\nNick Giles: Alright. Thanks for that, Bill. My second question would be, what's the impact of lower oil and other input prices on the cost side? Could you speak to when, some of that could flow through and if not, the second quarter, could we ultimately see some benefit in the third quarter that might not be reflected in your current guide?\nMolly Beerman: So as we look at our raw material cost in the second quarter, we are seeing caustic price increasing. We have about a $5 million negative. We didn't call that out in the guidance because we have productivity initiatives to offset it. And likewise, on the smelting side, we have price pressure primarily in Coke. That's about another $5 million, but the same we didn't call that out because we expect to overcome that with productivity.\nNick Giles: Got it. Thanks very much. Continue best of luck. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCarlos De Alba: Thank you very much. Just on working capital only, obviously, we're expecting all the consensus out ourselves an increase in working capital in the quarter, but it was a little bit more than expected. How do you see that playing out in the remaining quarters?\nMolly Beerman: Hi, Carlos. We will see working capital come down significantly throughout the year as we typically do. We do expect a pretty sizable drop-off in the second quarter just coming off some of the high pricing. As we looked at the timing of shipments as well as some of the build-up in raw material prices and volumes we did hit a higher working capital level in the first quarter than we had expected.\nCarlos De Alba: Fair enough. And then in your guidance, I just want to confirm that so you're expecting the second quarter to have a tax benefit between $50 million and $60 million. So this is for to say that it's because the expectation is to have negative profit in the quarter.\nMolly Beerman: It's not negative profit, Carlos. It's the remember, we calculate our taxes always on a year-to-date basis. And so we earned quite a bit in the first quarter. And as you look at declining alumina prices, then we have to do a catch-up entry for taxes to the first quarter. So it's really the catch-up entry that creates us into a net benefit position.\nWilliam Oplinger: Alright. Great. Thank you very much. Is that clear to you, Carlos? Because that's a tough concept. You forecast out for the year when you close your books, at the end of March what your taxes will be. And you book the taxes accordingly. Essentially, what we're saying is that profitability will be, at least with our current view, will be lower in the second quarter because of pricing coming down. And we will be booking a tax benefit associated with our full tax year tax guidance. So it's not that we're projecting a, you know, don't think that hey. They're projecting tax income because they're gonna have an EBITDA loss. That's not the case. You project out the full year taxes and adjust it each quarter. And just I don't want you to walk away thinking, wow. These guys are gonna be projecting negative PBT. In the second pre-tax profit. In the second quarter because of the tax guidance that we're providing.\nMolly Beerman: Yep. That's exactly correct. Thank you, Barb. You can be my using layman's terms? I'm sorry. But it's complex stuff. And the tone of the question was, man, you're gonna have big losses. No. That's not. It's just the catch-up. If you look at the two details, we will actually have regular tax expense related to earnings in the second quarter. But we will have a catch-up entry that will trigger a benefit related to the first quarter.\nWilliam Oplinger: Yep. Great. Thank you. There's mud, but I'm sure, Louis can clear everything up for everyone.\nOperator: The next question is from Daniel Major with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Major: Hi. Yes, thanks. Can you hear me okay?\nMolly Beerman: Yes. I do.\nDaniel Major: Great. Yeah. Thanks. Just follow-up on just clarify the sensitivities around the tariff. So I think you've clarified before that the tariff is based on the LME plus the duty unpaid premium that's about $300, I believe, at the moment. So the 25% tariff, like, if that was applied to that, would it be right that that would be about $975 million against the current Midwest of about $850. So is it the right assumption that if things normalize the premium list by around $100, all else equal, that would be broadly neutral to the business relative to the $100 million guided you've given based on the $0.39. Is that the right way of thinking about those sensitivities?\nWilliam Oplinger: We're not completely following the logic. And what I would suggest to you is you take that logic offline with Louis later, and he can answer it. What we can say is that the Midwest hasn't reacted as it's back to Timna's question. The Midwest has not reacted as high as what we would have anticipated based on a 25% 232 tariff. And the reasons for that are the two that Molly listed. One, there's still uncertainty around the tariffs, and I think the market is baked in uncertainty around the tariffs given some of the swings that we've seen. And then secondly, there was some importation of aluminum in advance of the tariffs that will need to burn through in the United States until you see that margin a the marginal ton to come to the United States.\nDaniel Major: Okay. Thanks for that. And then the second question on, San Ciprian, that's following up from Chris's question, but think previously, you'd indicated that one of the requirements to put more cash into the complex was the release of the restricted cash. I think that still sits about $88 million. Can you give us an update on when you expect that to be yeah, to be released and how that will be kind of distributed, but that go into funding cash burn beyond 2025 or will it move back onto Alcoa's balance sheet and into the sort of net debt bridge?\nMolly Beerman: We have had success having a portion of it released. So the money that was related to the restart there's about $12 million that's been released and we continue to have discussions with the workers' representatives on getting the balance released. There's about $75 million more there.\nDaniel Major: And do you have an expected timing on the release of that $75 million?\nMolly Beerman: Those discussions continue. We expect that we will guess recoveries related to the restart costs. Those will come in as we spend. We'll get those pieces released. But the part that is held related to the anode bake furnace build, that's a CapEx project that we are not going to do during this recovery period. That's about $50 million and that is the contentious point in the discussion.\nWilliam Oplinger: We are not planning on rebuilding the big furnace through 2027. So the thinking is that that would be held up that cash.\nDaniel Major: Okay. And then just final follow-up, if I could, on the guidance you gave on the cash burn for San Ciprian $90 million to $110 million. Is that for the smelter just the smelter and not the refinery?\nMolly Beerman: Just the smelter.\nDaniel Major: And I would assume the refinery is burning cash at $350 aluminum as well.\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. The refinery has been near breakeven through the first quarter as well, but it will move into a loss position with the lower API.\nDaniel Major: Okay. Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: The next question is from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKatja Jancic: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe going back to the Midwest Premium, and I apologize if I missed that. But what was the higher Midwest premium assumed in the net $100 million calculation? Of the tariff impact.\nMolly Beerman: Katja, we were comparing the thirty-one Midwest premium. We kind of consider that the base before tariffs. Of $0.24 and then comparing it to the Midwest premium earlier this week at $0.39. So that's the comparison.\nWilliam Oplinger: So the $100 million is based on a $0.39 Midwest premium.\nKatja Jancic: And Bill, you mentioned the Midwest Freight didn't react as expected based on the 25% tariffs. What would be the right Midwest premium with the tariffs?\nWilliam Oplinger: I had it in my slides presentation, so you're gonna ask me to go back to that. It was They $880 to $990. Thank you, Molly. You know my numbers better than I do. $880. It's on page seventeen of the slide presentation. $880 to $990. And that's what we would think the equilibrium would be at a 25%, Midwest premium. I'm sorry, 25% there.\nKatja Jancic: Thanks. And then maybe lastly, just on the permitting in Western Australia. Is that still progressing as expected?\nWilliam Oplinger: It is. We have a public comment period coming up here towards the beginning of the second quarter, so it is progressing as expected.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up from Nick Giles with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nNick Giles: Thank you very much for taking my follow-up. Iceland's prime minister made some comments around concerns that shipments from Iceland to the EU could be subject to trade restrictions. Whether or not that's drills, just wondering if you could comment on how Alcoa could be impacted by any trade action in the EU and maybe separately how Alcoa your desire to participate in the EU's you know, effort to ultimately reshore capacity? Thank you very much.\nWilliam Oplinger: Nick, it's a great question. That doesn't have a great answer. And the reason why I say that is there is just too much uncertainty still about what the EU will do in relation to the U.S. tariffs for us to speculate at this point. The U.S. tariffs are pretty well settled around the 232. However, the IEEFA tariffs and the reciprocal tariffs are still a lot of question. So for me to speculate what the Europeans will do, is, it's probably premature at this point. As far as reshoring capacity, we have capacity in two plants in Norway one in Iceland, and we're restarting the Spanish facility. We've talked a lot about the restart of the Spanish facility and the financial burden that that creates on the company, the reason why we're doing that is because we had a contractual commitment to restart it. And that's why we are restarting that capacity. So that in and of itself re shores a couple hundred thousand tons of smelting capacity into Europe.\nNick Giles: Well, that's very helpful. Appreciate all the color.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for any closing remarks.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks for joining our call today. Molly and I look forward to sharing further progress when we speak again in July. Thank you. We'll conclude our call.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.",

By pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Louis Langlois, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nLouis Langlois: Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, our Alcoa Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer, and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly.\nWilliam Oplinger: As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are intended in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted on this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Louis, and welcome to our first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Alcoa had strong first-quarter financial and production results. We maintained a fast pace of execution on our priorities despite economic uncertainty while progressing operational excellence through safety, stability, and continuous improvement. Underlying the strength of our performance were positive market conditions. Let's start with safety. First and foremost, a strong safety culture supports operational excellence. We had no fatal or serious injuries in the first quarter, and we continue to improve our safety performance. Operational stability is shown by solid production, where the majority of our operations improved sequentially on a tons-per-day basis. We also continued to improve stability at the Alumar smelter in Brazil, currently operating at approximately 91% capacity. We completed a $1 billion debt offering in Australia using most of the proceeds to repay existing debt. The new debt has extended the maturities at a lower after-tax interest expense than our previously outstanding debt. Lastly, we formed a joint venture with Ignis EQT for our San Ciprian operations and are now resuming production at the smelter in accordance with the viability agreement. Now I'll turn it over to Molly to take us through the strong financial results.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you, Bill. Revenue was down 3% sequentially, to $3.4 billion. In the Alumina segment, third-party revenue decreased 8% on lower average realized third-party price and lower shipments due to timing and decreased trading. In the aluminum segment, third-party revenue was flat due to an increase in the average realized third-party price offset by lower shipments in the first quarter after strong sales in the fourth quarter of 2024. First-quarter net income attributable to Alcoa was $548 million versus the prior quarter of $202 million with earnings per common share more than doubling to $2.07 per share. The sequential improvement reflects increased aluminum prices and lower intersegment profit elimination, partially offset by increased alumina costs and tariffs on our Canadian aluminum imported into the United States for U.S. customers. On an adjusted basis, net income attributable to Alcoa was $568 million or $2.15 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $178 million to $855 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. First-quarter adjusted EBITDA reflects higher aluminum prices and lower intersegment profit elimination which more than offset lower aluminum prices. Lower volume, increases in raw material and energy prices, and higher production costs were more than offset by improvements in price mix and other costs. Lower volume in the first quarter was expected after a strong fourth-quarter shipping schedule. Mainly alumina from our Australian refineries. Other costs primarily relate to intersegment elimination. The Aluminum segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $52 million primarily due to lower alumina prices, lower volume, and unfavorable currency impacts only partially offset by favorable production costs and other costs. The aluminum segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $60 million with higher metal prices and favorable currency more than offset by higher alumina costs and higher production, energy, raw material, and other costs. Included in other costs are approximately $20 million for U.S. Section 232 tariffs of 25% on aluminum imports from Canada which became effective on March 12. Outside the segment, other corporate costs decreased and the intersegment elimination expense decreased as expected with significantly lower average alumina price requiring less inventory profit elimination. Moving on to cash flow activities for the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with cash of $1.2 billion. Strong EBITDA led to positive cash from operations in the first quarter despite high consumption of cash for working capital build which is typical in our first quarter period. Working capital increased as inventories in both segments rose. In alumina, on higher raw material price and volume, and in aluminum on timing of raw material and aluminum shipments. Accounts payable decreased following elevated alumina trading payables in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we progressed our objective to reposition debt and delever with the issuance of $1 billion of debt in Australia and the tender of $890 million related to our outstanding 2027 and 2028 notes. It is our intention to continue to delever with an initial focus on the remainder of the 2027 notes. Moving on to other key financial metrics. The year-to-date return on equity was positive at 39.1%. Days working capital increased 13 days sequentially to 47 days. The same level year over year, but elevated from our year-end 2024 low. Our first-quarter dividend added $26 million to stockholder capital reach. We had positive free cash flow plus net non-controlling interest contributions for the quarter, includes the €25 million contribution from Ignis EQT related to the San Ciprian joint venture formation. Proceeds from the debt issuance in Australia less debt tendered added $95 million to the ending cash balance of $1.2 billion. As we turn to the next slide, I would like to share an update on our capital allocation target. Our overall capital allocation framework remains unchanged. It starts with maintaining a strong balance sheet throughout the cycle, and sufficiently funding our operations to sustain and improve them. The optimal capital structure for our company is reached when investment-grade leverage metrics are achieved reducing our WACC and creating value for our stockholders through a higher company valuation lower cost of financing and improved project viability. We want to maintain investment-grade leverage metrics throughout all business cycles not only at the mid or top part of the cycle. Based on this, we first defined a target for adjusted debt which includes pension and OPEB liabilities. This target is $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion. Then considering our historical use rate of cash, we target a cash balance between $1 million and $1.5 million. Netting the cash with the adjusted debt, results in our targeted range of adjusted net debt of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We believe this range fits our profile and anticipated use of leverage as a company. I want to clarify that we are not committing to receiving and or maintaining investment-grade credit ratings. The credit ratings are assessed by the rating agencies. We want to maintain the flexibility to raise additional debt for strategic upper at any point in the cycle. Our adjusted net debt was $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. As we get closer to the $1 billion to $1.5 billion target, we will look at all of our capital allocation priorities including cash returns to stockholders and parallel to paying down debt. Turning to the outlook. We have one adjustment to our full-year outlook. We are updating depreciation expense from $640 million to $620 million due primarily to favorable currency impact. For the second quarter of 2025, in the Alumina segment, we expect to maintain the strong level of performance delivered in the first quarter. In the aluminum segment, we expect performance to be unfavorable by approximately $105 million due to U.S. Section 232 tariff costs on imports of our Canadian aluminum. Increasing approximately $90 million sequentially. As well as operating costs associated with the restart of the San Ciprian smelter of approximately $15 million. Aluminum cost in the aluminum segment expected to be favorable by $165 million. For intersegment eliminations with the current market volatility, we recommend that you use the low end of the sensitivity range in your model. Below EBITDA, within other expenses, quarter. The first quarter included favorable impacts of $20 million due to foreign currency gains, which may not recur. Based on last week's pricing, we expect second-quarter operational tax to be a benefit of $50 million to $60 million which includes timing and catch-up adjustments related to lower alumina prices. In the appendix to the earnings material, you will see that our Midwest paid and Midwest unpaid premium sensitivities have been updated to reflect the expected trade flows as a result of tariff impacts. We also revised our regional premium distribution for your reference. Updates to the Midwest premium do not include the cost component of the tariffs. There is a new column on the sensitivity slide for the tariff cost impact which will appear in the other bar of our EBITDA bridge. Since the second quarter will be the first full quarter of tariffs, you should consider a quarterly tariff cost of approximately $105 million as a baseline calculated based on an LME of $2,400 and a Midwest premium of $0.39 per pound. We will update our sensitivities as needed our trade flows adjust to the tariff structure. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Molly. Let me take the opportunity to speak to the current status of U.S. Tariffs applicable to the aluminum industry from Alcoa's perspective. The U.S. section 232 tariff structure has been in place for some time, in March, the tariff increased from 10% to 25% and the exemption for Canadian metal imported into the U.S. was removed. This is the most material impact on Alcoa. As approximately 70% of our aluminum produced in Canada is destined for U.S. customers. We are now subject to 25% tariff cost, which totals an estimated $400 to $425 million annually. Of course, there is a higher Midwest premium, which offsets some of this cost and certainly benefits our U.S. smelters but currently the net annual result is approximately $100 million negative for our business. Next are the IEEPA tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. Since our aluminum products and the majority of our input materials from Canada and Mexico qualify under the USMCA provisions, Alcoa does not have a significant impact from this tariff at this time. The reciprocal tariffs specifically exclude Canada and Mexico, as well as aluminum products already subject to Section 232 tariffs. So no impact on Alcoa's aluminum sales. While alumina and other raw materials are excluded from the is now subject to the high reciprocal tariff. We expect these tariffs will increase our input cost by $10 to $15 million annually as there are no suitable replacement suppliers. In 2024, the U.S. imported approximately 4.2 million metric tons of primary aluminum, with imports of Canadian aluminum representing approximately 70% or 2.9 million metric tons. The four operating slippers in the U.S. produce 700,000 metric tons of aluminum each year, If all idle smelting capacity in the U.S. would restart, which approximately 600,000 metric tons, the U.S. would still be short by 3.6 million metric tons. It takes many years to build a new smelter and at least five to six smelters would be required to address the U.S. demand for primary aluminum. These new smelters would require additional energy production equivalent to almost seven new nuclear reactors. Or more than ten Hoover dams. Until additional smelting capacity is built in the U.S., the most efficient aluminum supply chain is Canadian aluminum flowing into the U.S. That being said, our global smelting portfolio and commercial experience give us options to shift metal supply as needed if trade policies and economics warrant. We've operated for more than 135 years in the aluminum industry. Building on our experience, we will continue our engagement efforts with the U.S. government and policymakers to advocate for the best outcome possible. Now let's discuss our market. In alumina, after reaching an all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2024, alumina prices declined in the first quarter of 2025. This was due to relatively higher liquidity, mainly driven by the Chinese refinery ramp-ups and normalized production outside China following several disruptions last year. As well as more recent alumina price declines on softened sentiment given global market uncertainty. The market has resolved most of the issues leading to a tightness in 2024, there is still uncertainty about the timing of the planned refinery ramp-ups in Indonesia and India this year. With bauxite prices remaining relatively high, and the current lower alumina price, we estimate that over 80% of Chinese refineries are unprofitable. Additionally, a recent announcement by the Chinese government stated that there would be higher scrutiny on new alumina projects regarding air pollution control, off-site sourcing, and red mud processing, which could bring additional constraints on growth in Chinese alumina production and may accelerate curtailment. This is a dynamic market and Alcoa's global network of refineries provides security and supply of alumina both to Alcoa smelters and our major customers which are primarily in the milli. A final point to highlight here is the opportunity we had in the first quarter to capitalize on tightness in the Bauxite market. The high prices in the first quarter, we participated in the spot markets capture benefits for some volumes from our joint venture in Guinea. Let's move on to Alimida. The LME aluminum price was generally resilient in the first quarter even with the decreasing aluminum price. With tariff announcements earlier this month, the LME responded by turning lower reflecting the uncertainty of the impact of tariffs on the global economy and aluminum market. The Midwest premium increased with the introduction of tariffs, it has not reached the $880 to $990 per ton level, which analysts predict supports shipments from any region to the U.S. Logistics still favor shipments from Canada to the U.S. compared to other potential major suppliers. In our view, the Midwest premium has not fully responded due to the uncertain mark settlement as well as inventory build in the U.S. ahead of the tariffs. The depletion of these inventories should trigger some upward response. Despite the uncertainty caused by the U.S. tariffs, there were some supportive signs on the demand side in the first quarter. Namely the Chinese stimulus and European fiscal loosening. Aluminum supply growth in the first quarter was very limited as smelter ramp-ups were offset by the effect of closures that took place at the end of last year. North America, our aluminum value-add product shipment volumes increased both sequentially and year over year with healthy demand for slab, billet, and rod. However, it is difficult to say whether our customers were anticipating tariffs and therefore buying in advance. In Europe, there were slightly lower VAT volumes in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, but up year over year with strong demand for rod and slab and billet demand finally improving. For both regions, we saw the negative impact of tariffs in our foundry order book which is closely tied with the automotive market and faces the largest amount of uncertainty from the tariff impact. Turning to Spain, we recently announced the formation of the joint venture with Ignis EQT support the continued operation of the San Ciprian complex. The idle smoking capacity is now being restarted to meet our obligation under the viability agreement, which was signed with our workforce when we curtailed the smelter in 2021, due to exorbitant energy prices. We are now focused on safely restarting the idle capacity. We will focus on repeating the strong operational results delivered in the first quarter. However, we are now adding the challenge of navigating uncertainty in our markets. A good time to consider the actions we've taken both recently and in the past to be well positioned to address adversity and capture opportunity. As a pure-play aluminum company, vertically integrated from mine to metal with a global footprint and cost-effective portfolio of assets, Alcoa has the ability to maneuver and respond to challenging and changing markets and policies. Security of supply through long-term contracts is valued by our customers. We also have the most comprehensive low-carbon product portfolio in the aluminum industry to meet customer needs. The company has a significant cash balance a strong capital structure, with no near-term debt maturities or other obligations requiring significant cash outlays beyond normal operations. We've taken strategic actions that strengthened the company over time including the recent acquisition of Alumina Limited and the announcement of the sale of the Modern Joint Ventures. Which is expected to close in the second quarter. We have a track record of monetizing non-core assets including transformation sites, which drive value for our stockholders. We also executed initiatives to be more cost-effective as demonstrated by our over-delivering our $645 million profitability program last year. These competitive advantages and actions support Alcoa's resilience. In summary, as we close up the presentation, Alcoa had a strong first quarter with improved safety and stable production. As a company, we made good progress on strategic actions. Looking ahead, we plan to maintain a fast pace of execution on our 2025 key areas of focus and strategic initiatives, improve the competitiveness of our operations, and navigate market challenges to deliver value to our stockholders. Operator, let's start the question and answer portion of the session.\nOperator: Our first question today is from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTimna Tanners: Yes. Good evening. Hope you're all well. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the tariff math if we could. I know that we heard from Molly a $105 million quarterly hit, and then I heard another $100 million from Bill. I just want to make sure I understood the distinction there. And I know in the past, Molly had talked about tens of millions of impact. I think that was assuming a higher Midwest premium, but just was hoping for a bit more clarification, please.\nMolly Beerman: Hi, Timna. So the first $100 million that we talked about, the negative $100 million to our overall business, that is when you consider we are getting a higher Midwest premium on our U.S. tons that brings a value of about $95 million. We'll also get a higher value within our Canadian asset sale, sorry, Canadian metal sales. It's into the U.S., that's $222 million. But going against that is the $400 million that Bill spoke of the cost of the Canadian tariff. So that met to the $100 million, and that's for the year. So that is a net number the revenue considered against the tariff cost. When I spoke of the $105 million, that is a quarterly figure, that $105 million is calculated based on an LME of $2,400 and a Midwest premium of $0.39. And those are the same assumptions that are in the first $100 million for the company as a whole. When we spoke to Timna about the impact earlier, we were using different Midwest premium assumptions. We had expected that the Midwest premium would respond more quickly, it is not. It is still down from what we would hope. We see that because of the negative sentiment in the market, as well as the fact that some tons did get stockpiled in inventory in the U.S. ahead of the tariff. And until that stockpile depletes, we don't have the impetus for price pressure up.\nTimna Tanners: Understood. That's helpful. And then my follow-up on tip again would be any updated thoughts on the stickiness of these tariffs? And if sticky, do you think about restarting Warwick in what timeframe? Thanks a lot.\nWilliam Oplinger: Timna, thanks for the question. Hard to make a restart decision based on a tariff that can change and I really can't comment on the stickiness because we've seen the volatility of discussions around the tariffs over the last 60 days. So, yeah, we just don't know whether they will stick. And we wouldn't necessarily make a decision to restart capacity simply based on tariffs. Just because they can change.\nTimna Tanners: Understood. Thanks again.\nOperator: The next question is from William Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Peterson: Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe following up on the tariffs a bit. So you talk about engaging with governments, policymakers, you know, U.S. and abroad. But can you provide, I guess, additional color on the level of engagement, who made Trump and maybe you know, Canadian administrations you're dealing with? And I guess, are you going at it alone as Alcoa or partnership with other aluminum companies or maybe potentially customers? Your products? I'm asking the second part of the context of some competitors either with larger portion of domestic production or even, like, Middle Eastern competitors that are evidently announcing intentions to build U.S. capacity. I'm basically wondering are there are there some in the administration that are sympathetic to your arguments that the U.S. really isn't gonna be able to close the gap anytime soon?\nWilliam Oplinger: William, so it's a wide-ranging question. I'll give you a wide-ranging answer. We are engaging with both the U.S. government and the Canadian government we're doing that as Alcoa. We're also doing that through the U.S. Aluminum Association. We have met either through ourselves or through the association with a number of President Trump's direct reports. And the message is fairly simple. The message is that the U.S. imports a lot of its primary aluminum. And that in order to support the downstream processing jobs, we need to have economic upstream aluminum production that can come in through preferably through Canada, but through other countries. We've met with the Canadian government both the outgoing prime minister, Mr. Trudeau, also the current prime minister of Mr. Carney, and have had very good discussions there. So a lot of engagement both through us and the aluminum association and the way I would characterize it is that and I and I should say it's been with the administration. It's been with the house members. It's also been with the senate and senators. I would characterize it that people are listening to us. They're understanding the situation. And we'll see where we get to. But it has been at least a reception to the message that we've provided.\nWilliam Peterson: Oh, yeah. Thanks for that. Thanks for those insights. And then, you know, you had the cost curve on alumina, but I'm wondering where alumina pricing is tracking today. As well as, you know, potentially challenging fundamental backdrop ahead do you think the marginal cost support of aluminum stands today globally?\nWilliam Oplinger: As of today, as I said in my prepared remarks, over 80% of the Chinese refining system is underwater. And so we believe that there's good support level at today's pricing. We just saw today, in know, this is very recent news, that alumina prices came back up overnight by $17. So, you know, it feels like there's some support at the levels that it's at. Now that is all based on, bauxite pricing. And bauxite pricing has been strong through the first three and a half months of the year. And it still sits at $80 to $85 a ton bauxite pricing and that is support for alumina cost.\nWilliam Peterson: Thanks, Scott.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, William. The next question is from Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.\nChris LaFemina: Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on San Ciprian. So the slide that you have here, you talk about the impact on 2025 and then also the hedging strategy. You've deployed it to mitigate financial risk from 2025 to 2027. So if we're looking at don't know, $100 million to $120 million of negative cash flow from the restart of the smelter in 2025, what happens beyond 2025? How do the hedges help? And then secondly, I think there was, you know, the guidance had been that if you burn through roughly $200 million at San Ciprian comes to a point where you just can't continue to subsidize this? And does this hedging strategy that you refer to here protect you from that over the 2025 to 2027 period?\nMolly Beerman: First, I'll take this one. Fortunately, we did start to put the hedges in place several weeks ago, and we have secured hedge pricing that will help us to manage the cost within the funding envelope. We are focused year by year on 2025. We released the guidance for the smelter. We expect to lose about $70 million to $90 million in EBITDA. The cash used by those operations will be about $90 million to $110 million. The CapEx that we referred to is already included in our CapEx guidance.\nWilliam Oplinger: It's important to remember also that a portion of that CapEx, we would need to spend anyway. A portion of that CapEx is going toward the raise of the refinery Red Bud Lake that no matter whether we were running it or not, we would need to be able to make that because it also assists us in the final closure of that Red Muttling.\nChris LaFemina: Right. And could you quantify what the EBITDA impact would be in 2026 if you assume that prices don't change? I mean, how much of that $70 million to $90 million negative impact in 2025 is a function of restart and kind of other one-off costs that I'm not going to repeat? And also much of that is protected by tariffs and sorry, by your hedging in 2026? In other words, is this going to be $70 million to $90 million a year or is it going to be a lot less than that in terms of the loss in 2026, if we assume prices don't change?\nMolly Beerman: The smelter losses are heavier in 2025 because we have the inefficient of the restarts. We've not yet released the 2026 numbers, Chris. We'll look to do that as we get closer to the end of the year.\nChris LaFemina: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Nick Giles with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nNick Giles: Thanks, operator. Good evening, everyone. My first question was, you mentioned the higher scrutiny on future alumina production in China. But if 80% are unprofitable today what do you think it will ultimately take for Chinese aluminum refineries to curtail output?\nWilliam Oplinger: We're seeing part of it today already. The Chinese, in my history in the industry. And so we're seeing it today with maintenance outages, extended maintenance outages. So, you know, I really believe that they will react quickly to loss-making sites.\nNick Giles: Thanks for that, Bill. And then maybe just a follow-up there. You mentioned spot bauxite opportunities in one q, and so with the lower alumina prices but bauxite prices remaining more resilient. Could it make sense to reduce alumina production and sell more bauxite directly to Chinese?\nWilliam Oplinger: I think the economics would be really, really difficult to do that. And the reason why I say that is the marginal tons that you run through the refinery are generally pretty low cost. And so I don't believe and I don't I haven't looked at the numbers recently. But I don't believe it would support curtailing refining capacity to sell bauxite into China. So I just don't think that would solve at this point.\nNick Giles: Alright. Thanks for that, Bill. My second question would be, what's the impact of lower oil and other input prices on the cost side? Could you speak to when, some of that could flow through and if not, the second quarter, could we ultimately see some benefit in the third quarter that might not be reflected in your current guide?\nMolly Beerman: So as we look at our raw material cost in the second quarter, we are seeing caustic price increasing. We have about a $5 million negative. We didn't call that out in the guidance because we have productivity initiatives to offset it. And likewise, on the smelting side, we have price pressure primarily in Coke. That's about another $5 million, but the same we didn't call that out because we expect to overcome that with productivity.\nNick Giles: Got it. Thanks very much. Continue best of luck. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCarlos De Alba: Thank you very much. Just on working capital only, obviously, we're expecting all the consensus out ourselves an increase in working capital in the quarter, but it was a little bit more than expected. How do you see that playing out in the remaining quarters?\nMolly Beerman: Hi, Carlos. We will see working capital come down significantly throughout the year as we typically do. We do expect a pretty sizable drop-off in the second quarter just coming off some of the high pricing. As we looked at the timing of shipments as well as some of the build-up in raw material prices and volumes we did hit a higher working capital level in the first quarter than we had expected.\nCarlos De Alba: Fair enough. And then in your guidance, I just want to confirm that so you're expecting the second quarter to have a tax benefit between $50 million and $60 million. So this is for to say that it's because the expectation is to have negative profit in the quarter.\nMolly Beerman: It's not negative profit, Carlos. It's the remember, we calculate our taxes always on a year-to-date basis. And so we earned quite a bit in the first quarter. And as you look at declining alumina prices, then we have to do a catch-up entry for taxes to the first quarter. So it's really the catch-up entry that creates us into a net benefit position.\nWilliam Oplinger: Alright. Great. Thank you very much. Is that clear to you, Carlos? Because that's a tough concept. You forecast out for the year when you close your books, at the end of March what your taxes will be. And you book the taxes accordingly. Essentially, what we're saying is that profitability will be, at least with our current view, will be lower in the second quarter because of pricing coming down. And we will be booking a tax benefit associated with our full tax year tax guidance. So it's not that we're projecting a, you know, don't think that hey. They're projecting tax income because they're gonna have an EBITDA loss. That's not the case. You project out the full year taxes and adjust it each quarter. And just I don't want you to walk away thinking, wow. These guys are gonna be projecting negative PBT. In the second pre-tax profit. In the second quarter because of the tax guidance that we're providing.\nMolly Beerman: Yep. That's exactly correct. Thank you, Barb. You can be my using layman's terms? I'm sorry. But it's complex stuff. And the tone of the question was, man, you're gonna have big losses. No. That's not. It's just the catch-up. If you look at the two details, we will actually have regular tax expense related to earnings in the second quarter. But we will have a catch-up entry that will trigger a benefit related to the first quarter.\nWilliam Oplinger: Yep. Great. Thank you. There's mud, but I'm sure, Louis can clear everything up for everyone.\nOperator: The next question is from Daniel Major with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Major: Hi. Yes, thanks. Can you hear me okay?\nMolly Beerman: Yes. I do.\nDaniel Major: Great. Yeah. Thanks. Just follow-up on just clarify the sensitivities around the tariff. So I think you've clarified before that the tariff is based on the LME plus the duty unpaid premium that's about $300, I believe, at the moment. So the 25% tariff, like, if that was applied to that, would it be right that that would be about $975 million against the current Midwest of about $850. So is it the right assumption that if things normalize the premium list by around $100, all else equal, that would be broadly neutral to the business relative to the $100 million guided you've given based on the $0.39. Is that the right way of thinking about those sensitivities?\nWilliam Oplinger: We're not completely following the logic. And what I would suggest to you is you take that logic offline with Louis later, and he can answer it. What we can say is that the Midwest hasn't reacted as it's back to Timna's question. The Midwest has not reacted as high as what we would have anticipated based on a 25% 232 tariff. And the reasons for that are the two that Molly listed. One, there's still uncertainty around the tariffs, and I think the market is baked in uncertainty around the tariffs given some of the swings that we've seen. And then secondly, there was some importation of aluminum in advance of the tariffs that will need to burn through in the United States until you see that margin a the marginal ton to come to the United States.\nDaniel Major: Okay. Thanks for that. And then the second question on, San Ciprian, that's following up from Chris's question, but think previously, you'd indicated that one of the requirements to put more cash into the complex was the release of the restricted cash. I think that still sits about $88 million. Can you give us an update on when you expect that to be yeah, to be released and how that will be kind of distributed, but that go into funding cash burn beyond 2025 or will it move back onto Alcoa's balance sheet and into the sort of net debt bridge?\nMolly Beerman: We have had success having a portion of it released. So the money that was related to the restart there's about $12 million that's been released and we continue to have discussions with the workers' representatives on getting the balance released. There's about $75 million more there.\nDaniel Major: And do you have an expected timing on the release of that $75 million?\nMolly Beerman: Those discussions continue. We expect that we will guess recoveries related to the restart costs. Those will come in as we spend. We'll get those pieces released. But the part that is held related to the anode bake furnace build, that's a CapEx project that we are not going to do during this recovery period. That's about $50 million and that is the contentious point in the discussion.\nWilliam Oplinger: We are not planning on rebuilding the big furnace through 2027. So the thinking is that that would be held up that cash.\nDaniel Major: Okay. And then just final follow-up, if I could, on the guidance you gave on the cash burn for San Ciprian $90 million to $110 million. Is that for the smelter just the smelter and not the refinery?\nMolly Beerman: Just the smelter.\nDaniel Major: And I would assume the refinery is burning cash at $350 aluminum as well.\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. The refinery has been near breakeven through the first quarter as well, but it will move into a loss position with the lower API.\nDaniel Major: Okay. Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: The next question is from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKatja Jancic: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe going back to the Midwest Premium, and I apologize if I missed that. But what was the higher Midwest premium assumed in the net $100 million calculation? Of the tariff impact.\nMolly Beerman: Katja, we were comparing the thirty-one Midwest premium. We kind of consider that the base before tariffs. Of $0.24 and then comparing it to the Midwest premium earlier this week at $0.39. So that's the comparison.\nWilliam Oplinger: So the $100 million is based on a $0.39 Midwest premium.\nKatja Jancic: And Bill, you mentioned the Midwest Freight didn't react as expected based on the 25% tariffs. What would be the right Midwest premium with the tariffs?\nWilliam Oplinger: I had it in my slides presentation, so you're gonna ask me to go back to that. It was They $880 to $990. Thank you, Molly. You know my numbers better than I do. $880. It's on page seventeen of the slide presentation. $880 to $990. And that's what we would think the equilibrium would be at a 25%, Midwest premium. I'm sorry, 25% there.\nKatja Jancic: Thanks. And then maybe lastly, just on the permitting in Western Australia. Is that still progressing as expected?\nWilliam Oplinger: It is. We have a public comment period coming up here towards the beginning of the second quarter, so it is progressing as expected.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up from Nick Giles with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nNick Giles: Thank you very much for taking my follow-up. Iceland's prime minister made some comments around concerns that shipments from Iceland to the EU could be subject to trade restrictions. Whether or not that's drills, just wondering if you could comment on how Alcoa could be impacted by any trade action in the EU and maybe separately how Alcoa your desire to participate in the EU's you know, effort to ultimately reshore capacity? Thank you very much.\nWilliam Oplinger: Nick, it's a great question. That doesn't have a great answer. And the reason why I say that is there is just too much uncertainty still about what the EU will do in relation to the U.S. tariffs for us to speculate at this point. The U.S. tariffs are pretty well settled around the 232. However, the IEEFA tariffs and the reciprocal tariffs are still a lot of question. So for me to speculate what the Europeans will do, is, it's probably premature at this point. As far as reshoring capacity, we have capacity in two plants in Norway one in Iceland, and we're restarting the Spanish facility. We've talked a lot about the restart of the Spanish facility and the financial burden that that creates on the company, the reason why we're doing that is because we had a contractual commitment to restart it. And that's why we are restarting that capacity. So that in and of itself re shores a couple hundred thousand tons of smelting capacity into Europe.\nNick Giles: Well, that's very helpful. Appreciate all the color.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for any closing remarks.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks for joining our call today. Molly and I look forward to sharing further progress when we speak again in July. Thank you. We'll conclude our call.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Louis Langlua, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nLouis Langlois: Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, Alcoa Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly. As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted on this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you, Louis, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today, we'll review the substantial progress we made during 2024 on key objectives, the financial results, the market and our plans to continue to improve and strengthen our company in 2025. Let's start with a recap of 2024. I'm very pleased that we had no fatalities or life altering injuries and improved our key safety metrics. We successfully operated under our new mine conditions in Western Australia, which included daily observation of our mining and rehabilitation practices by certain regulators. Nine of our 11 smelters increased annual production, with five achieving annual production records. On the people side, we onboarded and integrated new talent in several critical roles and promoted a culture that prioritizes high performance and continuous improvement. Commercially, we expanded a number of important customer and supplier relationships and invested in growth CapEx to enhance value add products needed by our customers to meet their manufacturing and sales objectives. In our sustained line of products, we announced our first sales of EcoSource non-metallurgical alumina and our low carbon Equilum primary aluminum now makes up half of our sales of metal in Europe. We delivered and exceeded our $645 million profitability improvement program ahead of schedule through initiatives which included savings on raw materials, actions to improve profitability and competitiveness, as well as changes to improve the financial performance of our operating portfolio. In November, we started delevering the company with the repayment of $385 million of debt while maintaining our quarterly dividend. We completed the Illumina Limited acquisition and initiated the sale of our investment in the Ma'aden joint ventures valued today at about $1.3 billion. Also in the fourth quarter of 2024, we progressed the cooperation with stakeholders to improve the long term outlook of our San Ciprian operations. To sum it up, 2024 was a successful year at Alcoa. Now I'll turn it over to Molly to take us through the strong financial results.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you, Bill. Revenue was up 20% sequentially to $3.5 billion. In the Alumina segment, third-party revenue increased 45% on higher average realized third-party price and higher shipments. In the Aluminum segment, third-party revenue increased 5% primarily due to the increase in average realized third-party price. Fourth quarter net income attributable to Alcoa was $202 million versus the prior quarter of $90 million, with earnings per common share doubling to $0.76 per share. These results include an additional $82 million restructuring charge for the Kwinana curtailment. During the fourth quarter, we completed the technical evaluation of the water management requirements for the residue areas and to increase the duration of the transition and related equipment costs for ongoing water treatment. On an adjusted basis, the net earnings attributable to Alcoa was $276 million or $1.04 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $222 million to $677 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA reflects higher alumina and aluminum prices, higher shipments and lower energy costs, partially offset by increased other costs primarily related to intersegment eliminations. The Alumina segment increased $349 million, primarily due to higher alumina prices, higher volume, while all other cost increases were mostly offset by currency gains. The Aluminum segment increased slightly with higher metal prices, production cost improvements, and lower energy costs being mostly offset by higher alumina costs. Outside the segments, other corporate costs increased, and the intersegment elimination expense increased as expected with significantly higher average alumina price requiring more inventory profit elimination. Moving on to cash flow activities for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. We used cash from improved earnings in the fourth quarter, along with cash on the balance sheet to repay the debt acquired in the Alumina Limited transaction. This repayment was partially offset by increased borrowings under an inventory repurchase program. Working capital improved slightly in the quarter as lower inventories and higher year-end accounts payables offset increased accounts receivables related to higher API and metal prices. For the year, capital expenditures, working capital changes, and environmental and ARO payments continue to be our largest uses of cash. Additionally, in 2024, our restructuring payments included approximately $140 million related to the Kwinana curtailment and approximately $35 million related to our employee commitments in Spain. Next, we'll review the performance on our profitability improvement program. We have already exceeded the $645 million target set for our profitability program, which was generally a two year program to improve our financial results from full year 2023's low EBITDA of $536 million. Overall, the improvements are evident in our year-over-year bridge by program or location. During the fourth quarter, we added $150 million to the third quarter's year-to-date progress for a total of $675 million. Through December 31, the company overachieved its $310 million target on raw materials with approximately $385 million in savings. Within our productivity and competitiveness program through December 31, we implemented actions contributing approximately $80 million of savings and expect to deliver the $100 million run rate target by the end of the first quarter of 2025. We have also progressed our portfolio improvements. To date, Warrick has achieved $45 million of its $60 million target. We also received the final ruling from the U.S. Treasury on the inclusion of direct materials and Section 45X of the IRA program, which adds roughly $15 million in annual credits or about half of the benefit we had expected. The Alumar smelter restart achieved approximately $105 million on its $75 million target and is currently operating at nearly 85% capacity. The Kwinana curtailment has been slow to deliver savings due to high transition and holding costs, but we will continue to work toward the $70 million improvement target. Moving on to other key financial metrics. The year-to-date return on equity is positive 6.5%. Days working capital decreased 11 days sequentially to 34 days, primarily due to a decrease in inventory days on increased sales. Our fourth quarter dividend added $27 million to stockholder capital returns. Free cash flow plus net non-controlling interest contribution was positive for the quarter, resulting in a cash balance of $1.1 billion. As we look ahead to 2025, continuing to delever and reposition debt to the jurisdictions where cash is needed will be a priority for us. Turning to the outlook for the full year and first quarter of 2025. To be clear, our outlook does not include any estimates for the impacts of potential tariffs. For the full year, we expect alumina production to range between 9.5 million and 9.7 million tonnes and shipments to range between 13.1 million and 13.3 million tonnes. The difference reflects our normal trading volumes as well as externally sourced alumina. The Aluminum segment is expected to produce 2.3 million to 2.5 million tonnes, increasing on smelter restarts, while shipments are expected to range between 2.6 million and 2.8 million tonnes. In EBITDA items outside the segments, we expect transformation costs to be $75 million, slightly increased from last year and reflecting the work we are doing to accelerate remediation activity in order to take advantage of potential asset monetization opportunities. Other corporate expense will improve to approximately $170 million, reflecting continued efforts to control our overhead costs. Below EBITDA, we expect depreciation to remain at approximately $640 million. Non-operating pension and OPEB expense is expected to be up slightly at $25 million and interest expense will be $165 million. For cash flow impacts, we expect 2025 pension and OPEB required cash funding to be similar to 2024 at $70 million. The majority of that spend is for the U.S. OPEB plan. Our capital returns to stockholders will continue to be aligned with our capital allocation framework. Our capital expenditure estimate is $700 million with $625 million in sustaining and $75 million in return seeking. The sustaining capital increase is $185 million over 2024, primarily due to a $70 million increase related to upcoming mine moves in Australia as well as a number of major projects, including energy transition projects in Juruti, a new ship unloader in Canada and upgrades to a bauxite reclaiming system in Australia. We expect return seeking investments to decrease following our investment in the Brazil bauxite vessels in 2024. However, we continue to identify capacity expansion projects and remain open to fund those requests if they meet return criteria and market conditions allow. We expect approximately $50 million of prior period income tax payments in 2025. That amount is lower than you might expect based on our 2024 higher earnings, primarily due to the utilization of the Alumina Limited carryforward net operating loss, which saved approximately $70 million on 2024 cash taxes. We have approximately $60 million of tax benefit related to that NOL remaining to use in future periods, subject to annual percentage limitations. Environmental and ARO spending is expected to be similar to 2024 at approximately $240 million. We do not provide guidance on full year cash restructuring charges but can show the portion attributable to the Kwinana curtailment. Approximately $140 million remains to be spent from the Kwinana restructuring reserve with a large majority of that to be dispersed in 2025. For the first quarter of 2025 at the segment level, in Alumina, we expect performance to be favorable by approximately $30 million due to the nonrecurring inventory adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter, partially offset by typical first quarter impacts from the beginning of maintenance cycles and lower shipping volumes. In the Aluminum segment, we expect performance to be unfavorable by approximately $60 million due to the nonrecurring IRA Section 45 true-up benefit recorded in the fourth quarter, lower seasonal pricing at the Brazil hydroelectric facilities, and the absence of Ma'aden offtake shipping volumes in accordance with the terms of the announced transaction. While the higher average price of alumina will increase overall Alcoa adjusted EBITDA, alumina cost in the Aluminum segment is expected to be unfavorable by approximately $90 million. Beyond the standard sensitivity provided for intersegment profit elimination, we anticipate an additional $20 million of income in the first quarter of 2025 due to the lower profit retained in inventory related to changes in production costs and volumes. Below EBITDA, within other expenses, contributions to ELYSIS in the first quarter of 2025 are expected to increase by $25 million, which triggers loss recognition. The fourth quarter of 2024 included negative impacts of $50 million due to foreign currency losses, which may not recur. Based on last week's pricing, we expect the first quarter of 2025 operational tax expense to approximate $120 million to $130 million. Note that the fourth quarter 2024 tax provision included a $55 million catch-up expense. Our sensitivities have been updated for our view of 2025. Please note that we revised our regional premium distribution due to the increase in the Alumar smelter shipments. Our pricing in Brazil is based on both index and fixed pricing. As a proxy for the average result of that pricing scheme, we see a high correlation to the Midwest duty unpaid index and suggest using that index for your model. Lastly, we have a new disclosure in the appendix. At the request of our stockholders, particularly those in Australia where per unit disclosures are widely available, we are now including cost per unit measures for the Alumina and Aluminum segments as a whole for your reference. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Molly. We expect to maintain our fast pace in 2025. Let's cover some of our key areas of focus in 2025. We want a step change in safety. We've made great progress in the last two years, but we want more. We see a direct correlation between safety and operational stability. We're continuing our pursuit of operational excellence, supported by the modernization of the Alcoa business system and with particular attention on improving the performance of our Brazilian operations. Progressing our mining approvals in Australia remains of paramount importance. We expect to raise the bar on commercial excellence through customer-focused decisions. We want to be positioned as the supplier of choice for customers in terms of product quality, innovation, sustainability, and security of supply. We plan to pursue targeted areas for growth via organic and inorganic opportunities. We will do that where returns exceed the cost of capital and deliver value to our shareholders. We are progressing our work on San Ciprian and expect to execute the first steps in 2025. Lastly, on capital allocation, delevering and repositioning debt are a priority for us. Assuming prices retain their strength, we expect to generate sufficient cash to enable further debt reductions. We believe delevering is another means to deliver value to our stockholders. Now let's discuss our markets. In alumina, prices reached an all-time high in the fourth quarter as a result of a tight market on lower-than-expected supply. In Guinea, a force majeure on bauxite exports to China from a major player in protests in the region all impacted the flow of bauxite exports. This is particularly relevant to the Chinese market that was already facing tight bauxite supply due to lower local production related to safety and environmental inspections at mines in northern China. Meanwhile, demand remained strong from smelters, resulting in low stocks available in the alumina spot market, creating competition for alumina cargos and increasing the cost of smelters. Looking ahead to 2025, in order for the alumina market to come back to balance, several ramp-up and new projects in China, Indonesia, and India must complete as planned. Also, bauxite availability is key to keeping refining projects in India and China on track. In Aluminum, global demand remained resilient in the fourth quarter. European and North American demand continues to be supported by the packaging and electrical sectors, while building and construction and automotive remain challenged. For building and construction, specifically, prior interest rate cuts in Europe and in the U.S. are likely to provide support for recovery. In China, growth in all end uses with the exception of building construction led to strong primary aluminum demand growth in 2024. The increase in alumina price has outweighed the increase in aluminum price and resulted in tighter margins for smelters exposed to spot price. Announced smelter curtailments in Russia, front-loaded maintenance at smelters in China, together with delayed ramp-ups in Indonesia have tightened global aluminum supply. For 2025, aluminum demand outside China is expected to rebound, with North America and Europe supported by higher real incomes and lower average interest rates year-over-year. Limited supply growth is expected globally in 2025 following recent curtailments and delayed ramp-ups, supported by China approaching the 45 million metric ton capacity cap. And of course, there is uncertainty related to the impact of any new U.S. tariffs, which could have wide ranging effects on supply, demand and trade flows. When we speak of the possibility of changing trade flows, it is important to point out Alcoa's competitive advantage as a vertically integrated primary aluminum player from mine to metal with bauxite mines, alumina refineries, and aluminum smelters and cast houses located across the world. This positioning gives Alcoa the ability to maneuver and respond to challenging and changing market and policy conditions. As I mentioned earlier, the tight supply in 2024 in bauxite and alumina caused alumina prices to rise to all-time highs, and some smelters had to cut production or delay ramp-ups. Our global network of mines and refineries enabled us to navigate these market conditions without significant operational issues while benefiting from the elevated alumina price. In aluminum, Alcoa's close proximity to customers in North America and Europe with smelters across the U.S., Canada and Europe. For both alumina and aluminum products, our customers value the security that comes with Alcoa sourced products. They appreciate our close proximity, reliable delivery performance as well as a variety of mature and stable transportation choices. Alcoa prides itself on offering high quality products across the value chain and continuing to innovate our products to meet customer needs, including low carbon solutions. When you transition from Alcoa's global footprint to look at the primary aluminum supply flows into the United States, you can see the U.S. currently has a significant inflow from Canada. The current discussions and proposals on tariffs by the U.S. government may have significant impacts on how metal is flowing from one country to another. Currently, the U.S. imports two-thirds of its primary aluminum from Canada. This was true both before and after the Section 232 tariffs on aluminum implemented by President Trump in his first term, who also granted an exemption to the tariffs for Canada and select other countries. If there were to be tariffs on Canadian aluminum imports to the U.S., this would represent a threat to U.S. industrial competitiveness. A 25% tariff on current Canadian export volume to the U.S. could represent $1.5 billion to $2 billion of additional annual cost for U.S. customers. In addition, increasing costs on trade with Canada and Mexico would particularly hurt the U.S. transportation supply chain, the largest end market in North America and specifically the automotive market. Trade flows would likely be impacted such that U.S. aluminum imports would increase from countries and regions that have a lower import duty level like the Middle East and India, while Canadian metal could reroute to Europe and other countries. In Alcoa's case, we could reroute supply from our Canadian smelters to Europe. While it is an advantage to have this optionality, it certainly is not a benefit for our customers and supply chains like them. That said, Alcoa is a 135 year old global company which operates in markets all over the world and has worked with governments on many topics throughout our history. If the U.S. government decides to implement new tariffs for strategic purposes, we will work with the administration to protect Alcoa's interests. Let's move on to talk about our work in Spain. We just announced further progress with our San Ciprian stakeholders. Alcoa Inespal, IGNIS EQT, the Spanish national and Xunta regional governments have entered into a memorandum of understanding to work cooperatively toward improving the long-term outlook for the complex. There are four key elements of the MOU, which include cooperation from the parties: first, support by the governments for our dialogue with San Ciprián workers to prioritize restarting the smelter over capital investments that can be deferred to a later date; second, streamline the authorization of renewable energy projects and deploy policies to achieve competitive energy costs; third, provide materially higher CO2 compensation support. We've already seen the Spanish national government increase the CO2 compensation program budget, which will provide meaningful support when the San Ciprian smelter reaches full capacity; last, support the approval by the regional government of the residue storage area capital projects, which are needed to maintain production in the refinery. We expect to use the momentum created by the MOU to continue advancing these key areas of cooperation as well as the remaining conditions, including energy supply contracts. Additionally, Alcoa Inespal and IGNIS EQT are working to finalize the partnership agreement. We are working to complete these steps as early as possible in the first quarter of 2025. As a company, we are proud of the progress we have made in the fourth quarter and in 2024 on multiple fronts. Looking ahead, we plan to maintain a fast pace of execution on our 2025 key areas of focus and strategic initiatives, improve the competitiveness of our operations, and capitalize on strong market fundamentals to deliver value to our stockholders. Operator, let's start the question-and-answer portion of the session.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Katya Jancic with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKatja Jancic: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe starting on tariffs, Bill, you mentioned if there are 25% tariffs on Canada, you would potentially divert that volume to European market. Where do you think the Midwest premium could actually go if we do start seeing that volume being directed and U.S. would still have to attract the volume from somewhere else?\nWilliam Oplinger: Yes, Katja. The Midwest premium, we think, will go substantially higher. I don't have a number in front of me on what we think it will end up at, but it will go substantially higher in order to attract volumes into the U.S. Ultimately, if there's a differential between Canadian and non-Canadian metal, you're going to see trade flows disrupted such way that us and other suppliers most likely will ship from Canadian metal into Europe. And you'll see Middle Eastern metal and potentially Indian metal coming into North America because there would potentially be a 15% trade differential. Literally, you'd see ships passing in the Atlantic carrying the exact same product back and forth, and it doesn't make a lot of sense. And so that's why we've shown the chart that we showed.\nKatja Jancic: And then maybe just for Alcoa specifically, would the increase in Midwest premium and your U.S. operation be enough to offset the negative impact from tariffs?\nWilliam Oplinger: So remember the differential between the size of production in the U.S. versus the size of production in Canada. We have roughly 900,000 metric tons in Canada and operating in the U.S. roughly 300,000 metric tons, so the differential would not offset. Now before we speculate too much, the tariff structure hasn't been set. We have been appreciative of the U.S. government taking the time to think through these tariffs. And we'll wait and see what it brings and then give you a view of the outlook at that point.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. Thank you. I'll hop back into the queue.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nLawson Winder: Thank you, operator, and good evening, Bill and Molly. Very nice hear from you both and nice work on a solid '24. If I could, I'd like to ask about your net debt position. Nice to see it fall during the quarter. Bill, I know you haven't done this in the recent past, but would you feel that you might be able to, in your position today, provide some sort of clarity on the net debt target for Alcoa? And then, how do you think about the Ma'aden equity position and how does that factor into your thinking? And I'm coming from the point of view just to try to gauge the timing of when Alcoa might consider some sort of potential increase in capital return.\nMolly Beerman: Lawson, I'll take the first part on our net debt target. We no longer have a stated net debt target. However, we are currently higher than we've been in the last three years. We closed the year at $2.1 billion in adjusted net debt. If you recall back to 2021 and '22, we were right around $1 billion in adjusted net debt, and that was certainly a more comfortable level for us. We will have delevering as well as repositioning debt as a priority in 2025. If we find, though, that we have excess cash after maintaining our strong balance sheet and funding our operations to sustain them, we will look at our capital allocation framework, and we'll look at shareholder returns, positioning for growth as well as any further portfolio actions that we need to take.\nWilliam Oplinger: And when we consider the Ma'aden transaction, it's important to remember that we've announced it but we haven't closed it. We anticipate that it will be closed in the first half of this year. The value on the day that we announced the transaction was roughly $1.1 billion. Subsequent to that time, the Ma'aden shares have increased so the value is more like $1.3 billion. We're very focused on getting that transaction closed. Recall that it has a lockup period of roughly a third, a third, a third, three years, four years, and five years. And so over that time period, we'll consider what we do with those shares but there is a lockup period. So we'll have some time before we potentially recognize that value.\nLawson Winder: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you for those comments. If I could actually jump to the bauxite market. And just you provided some commentary and it's helpful. It sounded kind of -- I guess it was a bit of a warning to some of these aluminum refineries that are ramping up. I mean, what are you hearing from your third-party customers in terms of bauxite availability? Do you have a sense that there is sufficient bauxite capacity in 2025 to see some of these new refineries in particular in India and China ramp up?\nWilliam Oplinger: The bauxite market currently is very tight. We see bauxite pricing into China at $120, $130 per tonne, probably the highest bauxite's ever been. When a coastal refinery in China is looking at restarting, if they're using imported bauxite, their bauxite cost alone is between -- somewhere between $250 and $300 per tonne. So the market is tight and it's tight for the reasons that we discussed in the prepared remarks. And that has a flow on impact on the alumina market. When we look at the alumina market, we think that alumina will remain tight, we believe, through the first half. I don't know what will happen after that. In order for the alumina market to loosen up, we need to see production coming online in India, Indonesia. But with a tight bauxite market and an expensive bauxite market, that pressures the alumina market further.\nLawson Winder: Okay. Thanks for your comments. Much appreciated.\nWilliam Oplinger: Good.\nOperator: The next question is from Daniel Major with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Major: Hi there. Can you hear me okay?\nWilliam Oplinger: Yes, I can. Hi, Daniel.\nDaniel Major: Great. Thanks. Yeah. Two questions. The first one just on San Ciprian. I guess, good progress with the memorandum of understanding, a couple of components. Can you confirm what the cash balance is at the end of the year at San Ciprian? And any updated projection based on kind of market prices as to when effectively that will run out of cash? And is the memorandum of understanding, I guess, it's encouraging but it doesn't guarantee a deal will be reached. Is that way of thinking about it?\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. I'll take the first part on the cash balance. So with recently high API prices, it has reduced our net cash consumption but cash is still depleting weekly. And so we do have a sense of urgency to complete our discussions and negotiations, primarily with the unions on the release of the restricted cash and with the energy suppliers on viable contracts. The decision for us to proceed with the JV formation and initial investments that would be made by Alcoa and our partner, IGNIS, will be based on the certainty that we have on each of the remaining items.\nWilliam Oplinger: As far as the MOU goes, we think the MOU is a step forward for the long-term viability of the site. The MOU provides essentially four things, as I outlined in my prepared remarks. Both the national and the regional government are supportive of prioritizing the smelter restart over the capital investments. They're supportive of streamlining the authorization of renewable energy projects, specifically wind farms. They're providing their support for materially higher CO2 compensation support. That's a big deal. Back in December 13, they talked about doubling compensation for CO2. That supports the long-term viability of the site. And then lastly, we need -- not least important but we need support on approval of the residue storage area uplift. With that said, Daniel, we continue to plan for the ramp-up of the smelter. But at this point, it can't be guaranteed. As we mentioned earlier, we still have several key pieces that need to fall in place. Currently, the smelter is not viable so ramping up production will accelerate the consumption of cash that Molly talked about from the proposed investment that must be reserved to support the long-term viability of the operations. We also need to hear from the Works Council on releasing the restricted cash. So the MOU is a step forward but it doesn't necessarily guarantee the restart of the smelter.\nDaniel Major: Very good. Thank you. And then second part of the question, lots of excitement around monetizing excess energy offtake that you have to feed the AI data center dynamic. Can you provide us with any numbers around megawatts to potential excess capacity and any steer around the upside to there?\nWilliam Oplinger: You were breaking up on us, but I think the question that you're asking was that, do we have excess energy that we can monetize around the world? And we have four positions down in Brazil that are part ownership in hydros that we sell into the marketplace there. We saw the benefit of some higher pricing in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter so that's a positive. That will fluctuate depending on what the rainfall essentially looks like and what the energy prices look like down in Brazil. The other place that we could potentially monetize energy is in but coal-fired power plants, and currently, we're using that energy to run the smelting. But those are really the two areas that we could monetize energy other than making it into aluminum.\nDaniel Major: Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Carlos de Alva with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCarlos de Alba: Thank you very much. Hello, Malia and Bill. So maybe similar vein of the last question but maybe slightly different. What is the opportunity that Alcoa has to potentially monetize idle sites, given the interest from data centers on that type of assets?\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks for the question, Carlos. And we actually have a history of monetizing legacy assets. That has generated significant value over time. And so while others may talk about it, we have actually done it. So for instance, in Texas, if you remember the Rockdale site, I believe we sold it for right around $270 million a number of years ago, and that has subsequently been redeveloped into certain areas. Again, we were able to monetize it and make good money. In advance of that, I should say after that, we sold the Intalco site for $100 million. That ultimately went to a data center developer and it was long before this craze around AI and data centers, and we were able to monetize $100 million there. We have a number of sites around the country and around the world that are uniquely positioned to be able to take advantage of both the data center and the AI situation. Why do I say they're uniquely positioned? They have generally energy connections that are able to bring energy in. So when I look at it, there are places like , Macia East. The one that's probably the most valuable is Point Comfort because it has access to a port. Globally, we have Point Henry, which is a site that's in Australia. So while I'm not willing to put a value on it, you see our track record before the real craze around AI and data centers of multi-hundred million dollar sales generation from these sites.\nCarlos de Alba: Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on that one. Is there any timetable, and you were focused obviously last year on closing the Alumina Limited. You have been making progress in San Ciprián, that's an ongoing effort. But do you have now this potential monetization of legacy assets in your agenda for the coming months, quarters? Any color as to when exactly where the company is potentially in this process and where we could see some benefit?\nWilliam Oplinger: No. And the reason why I say no, Carlos, is because these things take time and I want maximum value. We're not in a position where we need to do a fire sale on any of these assets. So if you recall the saga of Rockdale from a number of years ago, we had offers in Rockdale that were as small as $40 million, and we held out for maximum value that was -- again, my recollection was greater than $250 million. So I'm not going to lay out a timetable. We have assets that we can monetize in the case of something like Point Comfort. We're going through the demolition. We're going to make sure that we get maximum value out of these sites. So we're not in a rush to sell but it is actually a good market right now, so we'll let you know.\nCarlos de Alba: Fair enough. And I'm going to cheat a little bit since there was technically one question. If I may just ask on San Ciprian. So if all these efforts that you are putting into restarting the asset within a viable agreement don't work, don't play out, what would be like sort of maybe a range of the worst case for Alcoa and Alcoa's shareholders? How much money you would potentially lose or cash that would be stranded in the country? If you can provide some color or framework around that, that would be useful. Thank you very much.\nWilliam Oplinger: So Carlos, before Molly gives you some numbers, I will caution you that I don't want to speculate on the potential outcome here. We are focused on making San Ciprian a viable site. We just announced a significant support that we're really pleased with from both the national and the regional government. So we are focused on making that a viable site for the long term. That's our priority outcome. However, Molly can give you some numbers around potential curtailment or closure costs.\nMolly Beerman: So Carlos, these haven't updated from the last time. They remain the same. On the smelter without severance, we're looking at $40 million to $50 million in cash closure costs. On the refinery, again, without severance, we're about $200 million, but that does include about $80 million in the CapEx for the residue storage area. We're actually going to go ahead and do that work now. That will be needed, whether we're running or closing. And then a closure scenario, again, we're not there but we would be paying out those funds that I just spoke about over five to seven years.\nCarlos de Alba: Got you. Thank you. Thank you, Molly.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Carlos.\nOperator: The next question is from Nick Giles with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nNick Giles: Thank you very much, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on a really nice quarter here. I just wanted to follow up on some of your legacy power assets. What have conversations look like to date? Have you been approached by any hyperscalers or similar data center developers? Or is due diligence really just on Alcoa's end at this stage?\nWilliam Oplinger: Nick, we are in constant contact with developers on all of these sites. And it takes time and it takes a lot of work with various groups. These are generally not -- the landscape has changed a little bit with some of the hypers, the hyperscalers. But historically, these are generally not well-capitalized firms, so you go through a lot of process and ultimately find out that they don't have the money to be able to do it. But that's what we've done in places like Rockdale and Intalco. So we are in contact with folks and trying to move forward for the best value for our shareholders.\nNick Giles: Well, Bill, I think it's safe to say, everyone will be a little better capitalized after this target announcement last night. My next question was, first of all, congratulations on the execution of the profitability improvement program. I was wondering if you could provide an update on your productivity and competitiveness program. I think you had reached $45 million as of Q3. Should we still think about you exiting 1Q at the $100 million run rate? Thanks very much.\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. By that point, we'll have executed all the actions to hit the $100 million run rate. We actually put all of the productivity initiatives into our 2025 plan. While I know externally that you guys like these profitability programs, internally, they're actually hard to measure and hold accountable. So we took the step of building all of our improvements into our plan. That way, we can track it by operation by department and know who's accountable. So we're feeling good about going into 2025 with all of those actions locked down and accounted in the plan.\nNick Giles: Bill and Molly, thank you so much for all the color and continued best of luck. Thank you.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChris LaFemina: Thanks, operator. Hi, Bill and Molly. Thanks for taking my question. I was going to ask about CapEx, but first, just on to that profitability improvement program. Molly, you mentioned that it's hard to monitor that stuff internally. Well, it's also hard for us to monitor it externally. So if we look at what you've delivered there and we assume you get the full benefit from the Kwinana curtailment, we assume you get the full benefit of the productivity and competitive program that you just spoke about. We assume you get the full benefit of the work optimization. That would imply like $750 million in total benefits. And I think you did about $530 million roughly of EBITDA in 2023 before this program was implemented. So does that mean effectively that if we go back to a 2023 commodity price environment, EBITDA, instead of being $530 million, would be $750 million more than that, so it's more like $1.3 billion in that sort of price environment. Is that the way we should think about that program in terms of modeling it going forward?\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. I hear what you're saying, Chris, but I kind of focus on the performance side of it. So if you look at the numbers that we've listed in the chart on the progress that we've made, if you look at the year-over-year bridge, which is in the back of your appendix, you'll see that our initiatives have generated about $625 million of productivity that's showing up in the '23 to '24 bridge. That's on top of the market improvements of $740 million. So when you look at the deltas, we do have about $50 million of headwinds related to lower value-add product premiums and about $250 million other headwinds related to inflation and costs outside the program. So we have a net delivery that's very apparent in the bridge of over $300 million.\nWilliam Oplinger: And that's the beauty of that bridge, right? There's puts and takes. We have a massive effort in place to continuously improve the company, but the bridge spells out exactly what we ended up getting. And so it bridges the earnings to earnings, and it's pretty clear there.\nChris LaFemina: That's helpful. Thank you. And then secondly just on CapEx. So your 2025 CapEx guidance is probably a little bit higher than I think many in the market had expected. And Bill, you mentioned that there's some substantial projects that are contributing to the high sustaining CapEx for 2025. And it's up nearly $200 million versus 2024. How do we think about where that trends after 2025? So is it going to be a big lump of CapEx in 2025 and then it reverts back to somewhere normalized level in 2026? And then what is that more normalized level? How should we think about CapEx kind of through the cycle? Where should it be aside from your growth?\nMolly Beerman: So Chris, let me take this one. There's a couple of moving components because of the changes between sustaining and return-seeking. But if you think in 2024, we were guiding to about $600 million in expected CapEx. We did underspend that a bit. However, we're thinking of it as going from $600 million up to $700 million. And we have been guiding that we would add at least $50 million in the next two years related to the mine moves. As it turns out, we're adding $70 million in '25. I don't yet have the number for '26 on the mine moves, but you can expect that, that will be significant. The mine moves will take 3-ish years to complete so we would be elevated during that time.\nChris LaFemina: Okay. So that's 70% of the, I think, you said $185 million increase, right? Is the other $115 million all kind of one-off 2025 items that we should expect to reverse in 2026? Or are they just -- I mean, I understand there's a lot of moving parts. Just trying to think about where that might go even with the mine CapEx that you're spending.\nMolly Beerman: Yes, we have some opportunities with sustaining CapEx now to really improve our business. If you look at the projects that we mentioned, Juruti is going through an energy transition or connecting them to the grid there. We have a new ship unloader filling in, in Canada, that's significant expense, and then we also have a bauxite reclaimer in Western Australia. So maybe it's timing but we absolutely have an opportunity now to really improve the business. And so we are -- while we have the cash available, we are going to put it into the business.\nChris LaFemina: Great. Thank you for that. Good luck.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good evening, gentlemen, Molly.\nWilliam Oplinger: Hey, Michael.\nMichael Dudas: Bill, as you put forth your outlook for 2025 with regard to volumes and shipments, etc., maybe you could share like, are you anticipating in the cycle, tariffs aside, a recovery year, a more normalized year? Like what's the sense from your -- from the client base and what you're seeing about on the demand front where the cycle might be here as we move forward just from the overall outlook for, say, the aluminum industry?\nWilliam Oplinger: So let me start with aluminum and we'll just briefly hit on alumina and bauxite. But as we look forward on alumina, we are seeing global demand growth at roughly 2% on a growth on a year-over-year basis. That breaks down roughly of rest of world of 3% and China at approximately 1%. I'm rounding these numbers a little bit from the exact numbers, but it gives you an indication of what type of growth that we're seeing. Rest of world growth is actually pretty strong. China growth at 1% is historically low, but we'll see whether China takes any action around stimulus. And to me, potentially, that's upside. Then if I look at the rest of the world demand picture and we go kind of end market by end market, we continue to see demand strength in packaging. We continue to see demand strength in electrical conductor and electrical distribution. The automotive space is a little bit mixed. We are seeing strength in North America with a little bit of weakness in Europe. And then building construction, which is the largest demand driver globally for aluminum is still fairly weak. And building construction will be based on what happens with interest rates. And I know a lot of people were anticipating that interest rates would be lower in 2025. Just from a mathematics perspective, it looks like you'll be, on average, a little bit lower unless rates go higher from here. And we think that potentially offers some upside on the demand side. So that's the markets.\nMichael Dudas: Appreciate it. That's very helpful, Bill. And then maybe just a follow up. Do you think the market, as you're seeing -- as you're getting ready for it, do you think the market is expecting the tariffs that we're anticipating? Do you see a sense from the client base, market indices, how you're thinking about this? And how quickly or how rapidly can the industry kind of adjust to these dynamics since they seem to be happening at pretty breakneck speed here as we start the new administration?\nWilliam Oplinger: So I'm going to give you a little bit of a nonanswer, and it's just because there's not a lot of clarity around what the market is expecting. You look at the Midwest premium in the U.S. It has gone from something like $0.18 in November, December time frame to $0.24 today. So our -- is it anticipating some type of tariffs? It may be anticipating some type of tariff. What it's not anticipating is a 25% tariff. That would have a massive step-up in overall Midwest premium. So our customers -- and it's a question that Molly and I were just talking with our commercial team over the last couple of days. Our customers are in the same spot we're in. They don't know what to do as far as tariffs. They're not necessarily doing significant repositioning of metal because they just simply don't know. So we'll wait to see what comes of it. As far as how quickly things will turn, once the tariffs go into place, you will, I believe, immediately see a bump-up in the Midwest premium as soon as the tariffs take effect. And then over time, metal will flow, and we think it'll take, what do we say, one to two quarters that it will take time for metal to flow out of other regions if there is a tariff differential. So we're speaking about a situation where Canada has a 25% tariff and the rest of the world has a 10% tariff. We will see trade flows over the course of, let's say, half of the year, have significant impacts but it will start immediately.\nMichael Dudas: Bill, that was a great non-answer. I appreciate it.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, team. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to expand a little bit, I know you talked about use of cash debt pay down's a priority but you did allude to some expansions. And I know you've talked in the past about opportunity to revisit Warrick or Lista and others. Given this really high aluminum price, is it just a matter of alumina prices or balance not being compelling? Or what kind of decisions do you need to make to decide to restart in this environment?\nWilliam Oplinger: So thanks for the question. Timna. I hope you're doing well. The first and foremost is we need some clarity around the tariff structure before we do anything with the U.S. or Canadian assets or European assets. We need clarity around tariffs. And then you hit upon one that is big alumina prices. So as we look at potential -- the metal price may support additional capacity in a place like Lista, especially if we can get European energy prices at a reasonable level. But really factoring alumina, there's an opportunity cost of consuming alumina in a place like Lista that we can turn around and sell at $570 a tonne. So as we always do, once we get clarity around the tariffs, we'll factor in exchange rates, alumina prices, aluminum prices, and most importantly, energy prices to make a determination, specifically around Lista and Warrick. Those are the two places that we have excess capacity that could be restarted.\nTimna Tanners: Okay, helpful. Thank you. I also wanted to touch base on your technology initiatives as far as CapEx use. I know in the past, those were a big focus and there wasn't much emphasis in this presentation on some of the initiatives you've detailed in the past. So any update can you provide for us? Would those be kind of in line for capital uses or are they pushed out a bit? Thanks.\nWilliam Oplinger: So before Molly answers the numbers question, I do want to give you some insight into our thinking around our three key technology programs. ELYSIS in 2024 was a little bit of a disappointment in that it did not deliver the start of 450 Ka cells in 2024. We anticipate that in 2025, we will have a 450 Ka cell started in ELYSIS. So that's the anticipation there. When I look at Australia, we're making progress in Australia. We've gone from really a desktop-sized cell to a much larger cell, not commercially sized, not by any stretch, but we are stepping up the cell size in Australia. We're doing that at the Alcoa Technical Center. And then in the refinery side, we are making progress on key technologies, for instance, electric calcination that are promising. And so we're seeing that technology and looking at how we can apply it to our existing refineries to have a step change in both energy usage and carbon emissions. So Molly, do you want to address the dollar question?\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. Timna, we do not have significant technology dollars. I don't have the Australia-specific rate handy but recall it's around $15 million.\nWilliam Oplinger: And ELYSIS?\nMolly Beerman: No ELYSIS, CapEx.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Thank you. Helpful.\nOperator: The next question is from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBennett Moore: Good afternoon. This is Bennett on for Bill. If I could circle back to San Ciprián real quick, wondering what the feedback has been from the union and workforce regarding the MOU and proposed JV. Is this at all a bottleneck moving forward?\nWilliam Oplinger: So the MOU is really fresh, right? And so we had meetings with our employees and informed them of the MOU, but we are also being very balanced in the discussion around the MOU. The MOU is, as I said, as I characterized it, is a real step forward in that we have support from the national and the regional governments. But there are still certain things that need to come into place in order for us to guarantee the restart of the smelter. So that's the communication that we've had with our employees and with the unions. And they've heard that directly from us at this point.\nBennett Moore: Thanks for that. And then on permitting in Western Australia, has that public comment period begun? And what are the next milestones we should watch for after that?\nWilliam Oplinger: Go ahead, Molly.\nMolly Beerman: So the public comment period, we expect to commence towards the end of the first quarter and go into the second quarter. At this point, we're still on track for our approvals in 2026, and then the mine move and access to the upgraded bauxite no earlier than '27.\nBennett Moore: Thank you. Congrats on a great quarter.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for his closing remarks.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Gary, and thank you, all, for joining our call. Molly and I look forward to sharing further progress when we speak again in April. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Louis Langlua, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nLouis Langlois: Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, Alcoa Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly. As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted on this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you, Louis, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today, we'll review the substantial progress we made during 2024 on key objectives, the financial results, the market and our plans to continue to improve and strengthen our company in 2025. Let's start with a recap of 2024. I'm very pleased that we had no fatalities or life altering injuries and improved our key safety metrics. We successfully operated under our new mine conditions in Western Australia, which included daily observation of our mining and rehabilitation practices by certain regulators. Nine of our 11 smelters increased annual production, with five achieving annual production records. On the people side, we onboarded and integrated new talent in several critical roles and promoted a culture that prioritizes high performance and continuous improvement. Commercially, we expanded a number of important customer and supplier relationships and invested in growth CapEx to enhance value add products needed by our customers to meet their manufacturing and sales objectives. In our sustained line of products, we announced our first sales of EcoSource non-metallurgical alumina and our low carbon Equilum primary aluminum now makes up half of our sales of metal in Europe. We delivered and exceeded our $645 million profitability improvement program ahead of schedule through initiatives which included savings on raw materials, actions to improve profitability and competitiveness, as well as changes to improve the financial performance of our operating portfolio. In November, we started delevering the company with the repayment of $385 million of debt while maintaining our quarterly dividend. We completed the Illumina Limited acquisition and initiated the sale of our investment in the Ma'aden joint ventures valued today at about $1.3 billion. Also in the fourth quarter of 2024, we progressed the cooperation with stakeholders to improve the long term outlook of our San Ciprian operations. To sum it up, 2024 was a successful year at Alcoa. Now I'll turn it over to Molly to take us through the strong financial results.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you, Bill. Revenue was up 20% sequentially to $3.5 billion. In the Alumina segment, third-party revenue increased 45% on higher average realized third-party price and higher shipments. In the Aluminum segment, third-party revenue increased 5% primarily due to the increase in average realized third-party price. Fourth quarter net income attributable to Alcoa was $202 million versus the prior quarter of $90 million, with earnings per common share doubling to $0.76 per share. These results include an additional $82 million restructuring charge for the Kwinana curtailment. During the fourth quarter, we completed the technical evaluation of the water management requirements for the residue areas and to increase the duration of the transition and related equipment costs for ongoing water treatment. On an adjusted basis, the net earnings attributable to Alcoa was $276 million or $1.04 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $222 million to $677 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA reflects higher alumina and aluminum prices, higher shipments and lower energy costs, partially offset by increased other costs primarily related to intersegment eliminations. The Alumina segment increased $349 million, primarily due to higher alumina prices, higher volume, while all other cost increases were mostly offset by currency gains. The Aluminum segment increased slightly with higher metal prices, production cost improvements, and lower energy costs being mostly offset by higher alumina costs. Outside the segments, other corporate costs increased, and the intersegment elimination expense increased as expected with significantly higher average alumina price requiring more inventory profit elimination. Moving on to cash flow activities for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. We used cash from improved earnings in the fourth quarter, along with cash on the balance sheet to repay the debt acquired in the Alumina Limited transaction. This repayment was partially offset by increased borrowings under an inventory repurchase program. Working capital improved slightly in the quarter as lower inventories and higher year-end accounts payables offset increased accounts receivables related to higher API and metal prices. For the year, capital expenditures, working capital changes, and environmental and ARO payments continue to be our largest uses of cash. Additionally, in 2024, our restructuring payments included approximately $140 million related to the Kwinana curtailment and approximately $35 million related to our employee commitments in Spain. Next, we'll review the performance on our profitability improvement program. We have already exceeded the $645 million target set for our profitability program, which was generally a two year program to improve our financial results from full year 2023's low EBITDA of $536 million. Overall, the improvements are evident in our year-over-year bridge by program or location. During the fourth quarter, we added $150 million to the third quarter's year-to-date progress for a total of $675 million. Through December 31, the company overachieved its $310 million target on raw materials with approximately $385 million in savings. Within our productivity and competitiveness program through December 31, we implemented actions contributing approximately $80 million of savings and expect to deliver the $100 million run rate target by the end of the first quarter of 2025. We have also progressed our portfolio improvements. To date, Warrick has achieved $45 million of its $60 million target. We also received the final ruling from the U.S. Treasury on the inclusion of direct materials and Section 45X of the IRA program, which adds roughly $15 million in annual credits or about half of the benefit we had expected. The Alumar smelter restart achieved approximately $105 million on its $75 million target and is currently operating at nearly 85% capacity. The Kwinana curtailment has been slow to deliver savings due to high transition and holding costs, but we will continue to work toward the $70 million improvement target. Moving on to other key financial metrics. The year-to-date return on equity is positive 6.5%. Days working capital decreased 11 days sequentially to 34 days, primarily due to a decrease in inventory days on increased sales. Our fourth quarter dividend added $27 million to stockholder capital returns. Free cash flow plus net non-controlling interest contribution was positive for the quarter, resulting in a cash balance of $1.1 billion. As we look ahead to 2025, continuing to delever and reposition debt to the jurisdictions where cash is needed will be a priority for us. Turning to the outlook for the full year and first quarter of 2025. To be clear, our outlook does not include any estimates for the impacts of potential tariffs. For the full year, we expect alumina production to range between 9.5 million and 9.7 million tonnes and shipments to range between 13.1 million and 13.3 million tonnes. The difference reflects our normal trading volumes as well as externally sourced alumina. The Aluminum segment is expected to produce 2.3 million to 2.5 million tonnes, increasing on smelter restarts, while shipments are expected to range between 2.6 million and 2.8 million tonnes. In EBITDA items outside the segments, we expect transformation costs to be $75 million, slightly increased from last year and reflecting the work we are doing to accelerate remediation activity in order to take advantage of potential asset monetization opportunities. Other corporate expense will improve to approximately $170 million, reflecting continued efforts to control our overhead costs. Below EBITDA, we expect depreciation to remain at approximately $640 million. Non-operating pension and OPEB expense is expected to be up slightly at $25 million and interest expense will be $165 million. For cash flow impacts, we expect 2025 pension and OPEB required cash funding to be similar to 2024 at $70 million. The majority of that spend is for the U.S. OPEB plan. Our capital returns to stockholders will continue to be aligned with our capital allocation framework. Our capital expenditure estimate is $700 million with $625 million in sustaining and $75 million in return seeking. The sustaining capital increase is $185 million over 2024, primarily due to a $70 million increase related to upcoming mine moves in Australia as well as a number of major projects, including energy transition projects in Juruti, a new ship unloader in Canada and upgrades to a bauxite reclaiming system in Australia. We expect return seeking investments to decrease following our investment in the Brazil bauxite vessels in 2024. However, we continue to identify capacity expansion projects and remain open to fund those requests if they meet return criteria and market conditions allow. We expect approximately $50 million of prior period income tax payments in 2025. That amount is lower than you might expect based on our 2024 higher earnings, primarily due to the utilization of the Alumina Limited carryforward net operating loss, which saved approximately $70 million on 2024 cash taxes. We have approximately $60 million of tax benefit related to that NOL remaining to use in future periods, subject to annual percentage limitations. Environmental and ARO spending is expected to be similar to 2024 at approximately $240 million. We do not provide guidance on full year cash restructuring charges but can show the portion attributable to the Kwinana curtailment. Approximately $140 million remains to be spent from the Kwinana restructuring reserve with a large majority of that to be dispersed in 2025. For the first quarter of 2025 at the segment level, in Alumina, we expect performance to be favorable by approximately $30 million due to the nonrecurring inventory adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter, partially offset by typical first quarter impacts from the beginning of maintenance cycles and lower shipping volumes. In the Aluminum segment, we expect performance to be unfavorable by approximately $60 million due to the nonrecurring IRA Section 45 true-up benefit recorded in the fourth quarter, lower seasonal pricing at the Brazil hydroelectric facilities, and the absence of Ma'aden offtake shipping volumes in accordance with the terms of the announced transaction. While the higher average price of alumina will increase overall Alcoa adjusted EBITDA, alumina cost in the Aluminum segment is expected to be unfavorable by approximately $90 million. Beyond the standard sensitivity provided for intersegment profit elimination, we anticipate an additional $20 million of income in the first quarter of 2025 due to the lower profit retained in inventory related to changes in production costs and volumes. Below EBITDA, within other expenses, contributions to ELYSIS in the first quarter of 2025 are expected to increase by $25 million, which triggers loss recognition. The fourth quarter of 2024 included negative impacts of $50 million due to foreign currency losses, which may not recur. Based on last week's pricing, we expect the first quarter of 2025 operational tax expense to approximate $120 million to $130 million. Note that the fourth quarter 2024 tax provision included a $55 million catch-up expense. Our sensitivities have been updated for our view of 2025. Please note that we revised our regional premium distribution due to the increase in the Alumar smelter shipments. Our pricing in Brazil is based on both index and fixed pricing. As a proxy for the average result of that pricing scheme, we see a high correlation to the Midwest duty unpaid index and suggest using that index for your model. Lastly, we have a new disclosure in the appendix. At the request of our stockholders, particularly those in Australia where per unit disclosures are widely available, we are now including cost per unit measures for the Alumina and Aluminum segments as a whole for your reference. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Molly. We expect to maintain our fast pace in 2025. Let's cover some of our key areas of focus in 2025. We want a step change in safety. We've made great progress in the last two years, but we want more. We see a direct correlation between safety and operational stability. We're continuing our pursuit of operational excellence, supported by the modernization of the Alcoa business system and with particular attention on improving the performance of our Brazilian operations. Progressing our mining approvals in Australia remains of paramount importance. We expect to raise the bar on commercial excellence through customer-focused decisions. We want to be positioned as the supplier of choice for customers in terms of product quality, innovation, sustainability, and security of supply. We plan to pursue targeted areas for growth via organic and inorganic opportunities. We will do that where returns exceed the cost of capital and deliver value to our shareholders. We are progressing our work on San Ciprian and expect to execute the first steps in 2025. Lastly, on capital allocation, delevering and repositioning debt are a priority for us. Assuming prices retain their strength, we expect to generate sufficient cash to enable further debt reductions. We believe delevering is another means to deliver value to our stockholders. Now let's discuss our markets. In alumina, prices reached an all-time high in the fourth quarter as a result of a tight market on lower-than-expected supply. In Guinea, a force majeure on bauxite exports to China from a major player in protests in the region all impacted the flow of bauxite exports. This is particularly relevant to the Chinese market that was already facing tight bauxite supply due to lower local production related to safety and environmental inspections at mines in northern China. Meanwhile, demand remained strong from smelters, resulting in low stocks available in the alumina spot market, creating competition for alumina cargos and increasing the cost of smelters. Looking ahead to 2025, in order for the alumina market to come back to balance, several ramp-up and new projects in China, Indonesia, and India must complete as planned. Also, bauxite availability is key to keeping refining projects in India and China on track. In Aluminum, global demand remained resilient in the fourth quarter. European and North American demand continues to be supported by the packaging and electrical sectors, while building and construction and automotive remain challenged. For building and construction, specifically, prior interest rate cuts in Europe and in the U.S. are likely to provide support for recovery. In China, growth in all end uses with the exception of building construction led to strong primary aluminum demand growth in 2024. The increase in alumina price has outweighed the increase in aluminum price and resulted in tighter margins for smelters exposed to spot price. Announced smelter curtailments in Russia, front-loaded maintenance at smelters in China, together with delayed ramp-ups in Indonesia have tightened global aluminum supply. For 2025, aluminum demand outside China is expected to rebound, with North America and Europe supported by higher real incomes and lower average interest rates year-over-year. Limited supply growth is expected globally in 2025 following recent curtailments and delayed ramp-ups, supported by China approaching the 45 million metric ton capacity cap. And of course, there is uncertainty related to the impact of any new U.S. tariffs, which could have wide ranging effects on supply, demand and trade flows. When we speak of the possibility of changing trade flows, it is important to point out Alcoa's competitive advantage as a vertically integrated primary aluminum player from mine to metal with bauxite mines, alumina refineries, and aluminum smelters and cast houses located across the world. This positioning gives Alcoa the ability to maneuver and respond to challenging and changing market and policy conditions. As I mentioned earlier, the tight supply in 2024 in bauxite and alumina caused alumina prices to rise to all-time highs, and some smelters had to cut production or delay ramp-ups. Our global network of mines and refineries enabled us to navigate these market conditions without significant operational issues while benefiting from the elevated alumina price. In aluminum, Alcoa's close proximity to customers in North America and Europe with smelters across the U.S., Canada and Europe. For both alumina and aluminum products, our customers value the security that comes with Alcoa sourced products. They appreciate our close proximity, reliable delivery performance as well as a variety of mature and stable transportation choices. Alcoa prides itself on offering high quality products across the value chain and continuing to innovate our products to meet customer needs, including low carbon solutions. When you transition from Alcoa's global footprint to look at the primary aluminum supply flows into the United States, you can see the U.S. currently has a significant inflow from Canada. The current discussions and proposals on tariffs by the U.S. government may have significant impacts on how metal is flowing from one country to another. Currently, the U.S. imports two-thirds of its primary aluminum from Canada. This was true both before and after the Section 232 tariffs on aluminum implemented by President Trump in his first term, who also granted an exemption to the tariffs for Canada and select other countries. If there were to be tariffs on Canadian aluminum imports to the U.S., this would represent a threat to U.S. industrial competitiveness. A 25% tariff on current Canadian export volume to the U.S. could represent $1.5 billion to $2 billion of additional annual cost for U.S. customers. In addition, increasing costs on trade with Canada and Mexico would particularly hurt the U.S. transportation supply chain, the largest end market in North America and specifically the automotive market. Trade flows would likely be impacted such that U.S. aluminum imports would increase from countries and regions that have a lower import duty level like the Middle East and India, while Canadian metal could reroute to Europe and other countries. In Alcoa's case, we could reroute supply from our Canadian smelters to Europe. While it is an advantage to have this optionality, it certainly is not a benefit for our customers and supply chains like them. That said, Alcoa is a 135 year old global company which operates in markets all over the world and has worked with governments on many topics throughout our history. If the U.S. government decides to implement new tariffs for strategic purposes, we will work with the administration to protect Alcoa's interests. Let's move on to talk about our work in Spain. We just announced further progress with our San Ciprian stakeholders. Alcoa Inespal, IGNIS EQT, the Spanish national and Xunta regional governments have entered into a memorandum of understanding to work cooperatively toward improving the long-term outlook for the complex. There are four key elements of the MOU, which include cooperation from the parties: first, support by the governments for our dialogue with San Ciprián workers to prioritize restarting the smelter over capital investments that can be deferred to a later date; second, streamline the authorization of renewable energy projects and deploy policies to achieve competitive energy costs; third, provide materially higher CO2 compensation support. We've already seen the Spanish national government increase the CO2 compensation program budget, which will provide meaningful support when the San Ciprian smelter reaches full capacity; last, support the approval by the regional government of the residue storage area capital projects, which are needed to maintain production in the refinery. We expect to use the momentum created by the MOU to continue advancing these key areas of cooperation as well as the remaining conditions, including energy supply contracts. Additionally, Alcoa Inespal and IGNIS EQT are working to finalize the partnership agreement. We are working to complete these steps as early as possible in the first quarter of 2025. As a company, we are proud of the progress we have made in the fourth quarter and in 2024 on multiple fronts. Looking ahead, we plan to maintain a fast pace of execution on our 2025 key areas of focus and strategic initiatives, improve the competitiveness of our operations, and capitalize on strong market fundamentals to deliver value to our stockholders. Operator, let's start the question-and-answer portion of the session.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Katya Jancic with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKatja Jancic: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe starting on tariffs, Bill, you mentioned if there are 25% tariffs on Canada, you would potentially divert that volume to European market. Where do you think the Midwest premium could actually go if we do start seeing that volume being directed and U.S. would still have to attract the volume from somewhere else?\nWilliam Oplinger: Yes, Katja. The Midwest premium, we think, will go substantially higher. I don't have a number in front of me on what we think it will end up at, but it will go substantially higher in order to attract volumes into the U.S. Ultimately, if there's a differential between Canadian and non-Canadian metal, you're going to see trade flows disrupted such way that us and other suppliers most likely will ship from Canadian metal into Europe. And you'll see Middle Eastern metal and potentially Indian metal coming into North America because there would potentially be a 15% trade differential. Literally, you'd see ships passing in the Atlantic carrying the exact same product back and forth, and it doesn't make a lot of sense. And so that's why we've shown the chart that we showed.\nKatja Jancic: And then maybe just for Alcoa specifically, would the increase in Midwest premium and your U.S. operation be enough to offset the negative impact from tariffs?\nWilliam Oplinger: So remember the differential between the size of production in the U.S. versus the size of production in Canada. We have roughly 900,000 metric tons in Canada and operating in the U.S. roughly 300,000 metric tons, so the differential would not offset. Now before we speculate too much, the tariff structure hasn't been set. We have been appreciative of the U.S. government taking the time to think through these tariffs. And we'll wait and see what it brings and then give you a view of the outlook at that point.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. Thank you. I'll hop back into the queue.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nLawson Winder: Thank you, operator, and good evening, Bill and Molly. Very nice hear from you both and nice work on a solid '24. If I could, I'd like to ask about your net debt position. Nice to see it fall during the quarter. Bill, I know you haven't done this in the recent past, but would you feel that you might be able to, in your position today, provide some sort of clarity on the net debt target for Alcoa? And then, how do you think about the Ma'aden equity position and how does that factor into your thinking? And I'm coming from the point of view just to try to gauge the timing of when Alcoa might consider some sort of potential increase in capital return.\nMolly Beerman: Lawson, I'll take the first part on our net debt target. We no longer have a stated net debt target. However, we are currently higher than we've been in the last three years. We closed the year at $2.1 billion in adjusted net debt. If you recall back to 2021 and '22, we were right around $1 billion in adjusted net debt, and that was certainly a more comfortable level for us. We will have delevering as well as repositioning debt as a priority in 2025. If we find, though, that we have excess cash after maintaining our strong balance sheet and funding our operations to sustain them, we will look at our capital allocation framework, and we'll look at shareholder returns, positioning for growth as well as any further portfolio actions that we need to take.\nWilliam Oplinger: And when we consider the Ma'aden transaction, it's important to remember that we've announced it but we haven't closed it. We anticipate that it will be closed in the first half of this year. The value on the day that we announced the transaction was roughly $1.1 billion. Subsequent to that time, the Ma'aden shares have increased so the value is more like $1.3 billion. We're very focused on getting that transaction closed. Recall that it has a lockup period of roughly a third, a third, a third, three years, four years, and five years. And so over that time period, we'll consider what we do with those shares but there is a lockup period. So we'll have some time before we potentially recognize that value.\nLawson Winder: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you for those comments. If I could actually jump to the bauxite market. And just you provided some commentary and it's helpful. It sounded kind of -- I guess it was a bit of a warning to some of these aluminum refineries that are ramping up. I mean, what are you hearing from your third-party customers in terms of bauxite availability? Do you have a sense that there is sufficient bauxite capacity in 2025 to see some of these new refineries in particular in India and China ramp up?\nWilliam Oplinger: The bauxite market currently is very tight. We see bauxite pricing into China at $120, $130 per tonne, probably the highest bauxite's ever been. When a coastal refinery in China is looking at restarting, if they're using imported bauxite, their bauxite cost alone is between -- somewhere between $250 and $300 per tonne. So the market is tight and it's tight for the reasons that we discussed in the prepared remarks. And that has a flow on impact on the alumina market. When we look at the alumina market, we think that alumina will remain tight, we believe, through the first half. I don't know what will happen after that. In order for the alumina market to loosen up, we need to see production coming online in India, Indonesia. But with a tight bauxite market and an expensive bauxite market, that pressures the alumina market further.\nLawson Winder: Okay. Thanks for your comments. Much appreciated.\nWilliam Oplinger: Good.\nOperator: The next question is from Daniel Major with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Major: Hi there. Can you hear me okay?\nWilliam Oplinger: Yes, I can. Hi, Daniel.\nDaniel Major: Great. Thanks. Yeah. Two questions. The first one just on San Ciprian. I guess, good progress with the memorandum of understanding, a couple of components. Can you confirm what the cash balance is at the end of the year at San Ciprian? And any updated projection based on kind of market prices as to when effectively that will run out of cash? And is the memorandum of understanding, I guess, it's encouraging but it doesn't guarantee a deal will be reached. Is that way of thinking about it?\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. I'll take the first part on the cash balance. So with recently high API prices, it has reduced our net cash consumption but cash is still depleting weekly. And so we do have a sense of urgency to complete our discussions and negotiations, primarily with the unions on the release of the restricted cash and with the energy suppliers on viable contracts. The decision for us to proceed with the JV formation and initial investments that would be made by Alcoa and our partner, IGNIS, will be based on the certainty that we have on each of the remaining items.\nWilliam Oplinger: As far as the MOU goes, we think the MOU is a step forward for the long-term viability of the site. The MOU provides essentially four things, as I outlined in my prepared remarks. Both the national and the regional government are supportive of prioritizing the smelter restart over the capital investments. They're supportive of streamlining the authorization of renewable energy projects, specifically wind farms. They're providing their support for materially higher CO2 compensation support. That's a big deal. Back in December 13, they talked about doubling compensation for CO2. That supports the long-term viability of the site. And then lastly, we need -- not least important but we need support on approval of the residue storage area uplift. With that said, Daniel, we continue to plan for the ramp-up of the smelter. But at this point, it can't be guaranteed. As we mentioned earlier, we still have several key pieces that need to fall in place. Currently, the smelter is not viable so ramping up production will accelerate the consumption of cash that Molly talked about from the proposed investment that must be reserved to support the long-term viability of the operations. We also need to hear from the Works Council on releasing the restricted cash. So the MOU is a step forward but it doesn't necessarily guarantee the restart of the smelter.\nDaniel Major: Very good. Thank you. And then second part of the question, lots of excitement around monetizing excess energy offtake that you have to feed the AI data center dynamic. Can you provide us with any numbers around megawatts to potential excess capacity and any steer around the upside to there?\nWilliam Oplinger: You were breaking up on us, but I think the question that you're asking was that, do we have excess energy that we can monetize around the world? And we have four positions down in Brazil that are part ownership in hydros that we sell into the marketplace there. We saw the benefit of some higher pricing in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter so that's a positive. That will fluctuate depending on what the rainfall essentially looks like and what the energy prices look like down in Brazil. The other place that we could potentially monetize energy is in but coal-fired power plants, and currently, we're using that energy to run the smelting. But those are really the two areas that we could monetize energy other than making it into aluminum.\nDaniel Major: Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Carlos de Alva with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCarlos de Alba: Thank you very much. Hello, Malia and Bill. So maybe similar vein of the last question but maybe slightly different. What is the opportunity that Alcoa has to potentially monetize idle sites, given the interest from data centers on that type of assets?\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks for the question, Carlos. And we actually have a history of monetizing legacy assets. That has generated significant value over time. And so while others may talk about it, we have actually done it. So for instance, in Texas, if you remember the Rockdale site, I believe we sold it for right around $270 million a number of years ago, and that has subsequently been redeveloped into certain areas. Again, we were able to monetize it and make good money. In advance of that, I should say after that, we sold the Intalco site for $100 million. That ultimately went to a data center developer and it was long before this craze around AI and data centers, and we were able to monetize $100 million there. We have a number of sites around the country and around the world that are uniquely positioned to be able to take advantage of both the data center and the AI situation. Why do I say they're uniquely positioned? They have generally energy connections that are able to bring energy in. So when I look at it, there are places like , Macia East. The one that's probably the most valuable is Point Comfort because it has access to a port. Globally, we have Point Henry, which is a site that's in Australia. So while I'm not willing to put a value on it, you see our track record before the real craze around AI and data centers of multi-hundred million dollar sales generation from these sites.\nCarlos de Alba: Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on that one. Is there any timetable, and you were focused obviously last year on closing the Alumina Limited. You have been making progress in San Ciprián, that's an ongoing effort. But do you have now this potential monetization of legacy assets in your agenda for the coming months, quarters? Any color as to when exactly where the company is potentially in this process and where we could see some benefit?\nWilliam Oplinger: No. And the reason why I say no, Carlos, is because these things take time and I want maximum value. We're not in a position where we need to do a fire sale on any of these assets. So if you recall the saga of Rockdale from a number of years ago, we had offers in Rockdale that were as small as $40 million, and we held out for maximum value that was -- again, my recollection was greater than $250 million. So I'm not going to lay out a timetable. We have assets that we can monetize in the case of something like Point Comfort. We're going through the demolition. We're going to make sure that we get maximum value out of these sites. So we're not in a rush to sell but it is actually a good market right now, so we'll let you know.\nCarlos de Alba: Fair enough. And I'm going to cheat a little bit since there was technically one question. If I may just ask on San Ciprian. So if all these efforts that you are putting into restarting the asset within a viable agreement don't work, don't play out, what would be like sort of maybe a range of the worst case for Alcoa and Alcoa's shareholders? How much money you would potentially lose or cash that would be stranded in the country? If you can provide some color or framework around that, that would be useful. Thank you very much.\nWilliam Oplinger: So Carlos, before Molly gives you some numbers, I will caution you that I don't want to speculate on the potential outcome here. We are focused on making San Ciprian a viable site. We just announced a significant support that we're really pleased with from both the national and the regional government. So we are focused on making that a viable site for the long term. That's our priority outcome. However, Molly can give you some numbers around potential curtailment or closure costs.\nMolly Beerman: So Carlos, these haven't updated from the last time. They remain the same. On the smelter without severance, we're looking at $40 million to $50 million in cash closure costs. On the refinery, again, without severance, we're about $200 million, but that does include about $80 million in the CapEx for the residue storage area. We're actually going to go ahead and do that work now. That will be needed, whether we're running or closing. And then a closure scenario, again, we're not there but we would be paying out those funds that I just spoke about over five to seven years.\nCarlos de Alba: Got you. Thank you. Thank you, Molly.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Carlos.\nOperator: The next question is from Nick Giles with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nNick Giles: Thank you very much, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on a really nice quarter here. I just wanted to follow up on some of your legacy power assets. What have conversations look like to date? Have you been approached by any hyperscalers or similar data center developers? Or is due diligence really just on Alcoa's end at this stage?\nWilliam Oplinger: Nick, we are in constant contact with developers on all of these sites. And it takes time and it takes a lot of work with various groups. These are generally not -- the landscape has changed a little bit with some of the hypers, the hyperscalers. But historically, these are generally not well-capitalized firms, so you go through a lot of process and ultimately find out that they don't have the money to be able to do it. But that's what we've done in places like Rockdale and Intalco. So we are in contact with folks and trying to move forward for the best value for our shareholders.\nNick Giles: Well, Bill, I think it's safe to say, everyone will be a little better capitalized after this target announcement last night. My next question was, first of all, congratulations on the execution of the profitability improvement program. I was wondering if you could provide an update on your productivity and competitiveness program. I think you had reached $45 million as of Q3. Should we still think about you exiting 1Q at the $100 million run rate? Thanks very much.\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. By that point, we'll have executed all the actions to hit the $100 million run rate. We actually put all of the productivity initiatives into our 2025 plan. While I know externally that you guys like these profitability programs, internally, they're actually hard to measure and hold accountable. So we took the step of building all of our improvements into our plan. That way, we can track it by operation by department and know who's accountable. So we're feeling good about going into 2025 with all of those actions locked down and accounted in the plan.\nNick Giles: Bill and Molly, thank you so much for all the color and continued best of luck. Thank you.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChris LaFemina: Thanks, operator. Hi, Bill and Molly. Thanks for taking my question. I was going to ask about CapEx, but first, just on to that profitability improvement program. Molly, you mentioned that it's hard to monitor that stuff internally. Well, it's also hard for us to monitor it externally. So if we look at what you've delivered there and we assume you get the full benefit from the Kwinana curtailment, we assume you get the full benefit of the productivity and competitive program that you just spoke about. We assume you get the full benefit of the work optimization. That would imply like $750 million in total benefits. And I think you did about $530 million roughly of EBITDA in 2023 before this program was implemented. So does that mean effectively that if we go back to a 2023 commodity price environment, EBITDA, instead of being $530 million, would be $750 million more than that, so it's more like $1.3 billion in that sort of price environment. Is that the way we should think about that program in terms of modeling it going forward?\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. I hear what you're saying, Chris, but I kind of focus on the performance side of it. So if you look at the numbers that we've listed in the chart on the progress that we've made, if you look at the year-over-year bridge, which is in the back of your appendix, you'll see that our initiatives have generated about $625 million of productivity that's showing up in the '23 to '24 bridge. That's on top of the market improvements of $740 million. So when you look at the deltas, we do have about $50 million of headwinds related to lower value-add product premiums and about $250 million other headwinds related to inflation and costs outside the program. So we have a net delivery that's very apparent in the bridge of over $300 million.\nWilliam Oplinger: And that's the beauty of that bridge, right? There's puts and takes. We have a massive effort in place to continuously improve the company, but the bridge spells out exactly what we ended up getting. And so it bridges the earnings to earnings, and it's pretty clear there.\nChris LaFemina: That's helpful. Thank you. And then secondly just on CapEx. So your 2025 CapEx guidance is probably a little bit higher than I think many in the market had expected. And Bill, you mentioned that there's some substantial projects that are contributing to the high sustaining CapEx for 2025. And it's up nearly $200 million versus 2024. How do we think about where that trends after 2025? So is it going to be a big lump of CapEx in 2025 and then it reverts back to somewhere normalized level in 2026? And then what is that more normalized level? How should we think about CapEx kind of through the cycle? Where should it be aside from your growth?\nMolly Beerman: So Chris, let me take this one. There's a couple of moving components because of the changes between sustaining and return-seeking. But if you think in 2024, we were guiding to about $600 million in expected CapEx. We did underspend that a bit. However, we're thinking of it as going from $600 million up to $700 million. And we have been guiding that we would add at least $50 million in the next two years related to the mine moves. As it turns out, we're adding $70 million in '25. I don't yet have the number for '26 on the mine moves, but you can expect that, that will be significant. The mine moves will take 3-ish years to complete so we would be elevated during that time.\nChris LaFemina: Okay. So that's 70% of the, I think, you said $185 million increase, right? Is the other $115 million all kind of one-off 2025 items that we should expect to reverse in 2026? Or are they just -- I mean, I understand there's a lot of moving parts. Just trying to think about where that might go even with the mine CapEx that you're spending.\nMolly Beerman: Yes, we have some opportunities with sustaining CapEx now to really improve our business. If you look at the projects that we mentioned, Juruti is going through an energy transition or connecting them to the grid there. We have a new ship unloader filling in, in Canada, that's significant expense, and then we also have a bauxite reclaimer in Western Australia. So maybe it's timing but we absolutely have an opportunity now to really improve the business. And so we are -- while we have the cash available, we are going to put it into the business.\nChris LaFemina: Great. Thank you for that. Good luck.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good evening, gentlemen, Molly.\nWilliam Oplinger: Hey, Michael.\nMichael Dudas: Bill, as you put forth your outlook for 2025 with regard to volumes and shipments, etc., maybe you could share like, are you anticipating in the cycle, tariffs aside, a recovery year, a more normalized year? Like what's the sense from your -- from the client base and what you're seeing about on the demand front where the cycle might be here as we move forward just from the overall outlook for, say, the aluminum industry?\nWilliam Oplinger: So let me start with aluminum and we'll just briefly hit on alumina and bauxite. But as we look forward on alumina, we are seeing global demand growth at roughly 2% on a growth on a year-over-year basis. That breaks down roughly of rest of world of 3% and China at approximately 1%. I'm rounding these numbers a little bit from the exact numbers, but it gives you an indication of what type of growth that we're seeing. Rest of world growth is actually pretty strong. China growth at 1% is historically low, but we'll see whether China takes any action around stimulus. And to me, potentially, that's upside. Then if I look at the rest of the world demand picture and we go kind of end market by end market, we continue to see demand strength in packaging. We continue to see demand strength in electrical conductor and electrical distribution. The automotive space is a little bit mixed. We are seeing strength in North America with a little bit of weakness in Europe. And then building construction, which is the largest demand driver globally for aluminum is still fairly weak. And building construction will be based on what happens with interest rates. And I know a lot of people were anticipating that interest rates would be lower in 2025. Just from a mathematics perspective, it looks like you'll be, on average, a little bit lower unless rates go higher from here. And we think that potentially offers some upside on the demand side. So that's the markets.\nMichael Dudas: Appreciate it. That's very helpful, Bill. And then maybe just a follow up. Do you think the market, as you're seeing -- as you're getting ready for it, do you think the market is expecting the tariffs that we're anticipating? Do you see a sense from the client base, market indices, how you're thinking about this? And how quickly or how rapidly can the industry kind of adjust to these dynamics since they seem to be happening at pretty breakneck speed here as we start the new administration?\nWilliam Oplinger: So I'm going to give you a little bit of a nonanswer, and it's just because there's not a lot of clarity around what the market is expecting. You look at the Midwest premium in the U.S. It has gone from something like $0.18 in November, December time frame to $0.24 today. So our -- is it anticipating some type of tariffs? It may be anticipating some type of tariff. What it's not anticipating is a 25% tariff. That would have a massive step-up in overall Midwest premium. So our customers -- and it's a question that Molly and I were just talking with our commercial team over the last couple of days. Our customers are in the same spot we're in. They don't know what to do as far as tariffs. They're not necessarily doing significant repositioning of metal because they just simply don't know. So we'll wait to see what comes of it. As far as how quickly things will turn, once the tariffs go into place, you will, I believe, immediately see a bump-up in the Midwest premium as soon as the tariffs take effect. And then over time, metal will flow, and we think it'll take, what do we say, one to two quarters that it will take time for metal to flow out of other regions if there is a tariff differential. So we're speaking about a situation where Canada has a 25% tariff and the rest of the world has a 10% tariff. We will see trade flows over the course of, let's say, half of the year, have significant impacts but it will start immediately.\nMichael Dudas: Bill, that was a great non-answer. I appreciate it.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, team. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to expand a little bit, I know you talked about use of cash debt pay down's a priority but you did allude to some expansions. And I know you've talked in the past about opportunity to revisit Warrick or Lista and others. Given this really high aluminum price, is it just a matter of alumina prices or balance not being compelling? Or what kind of decisions do you need to make to decide to restart in this environment?\nWilliam Oplinger: So thanks for the question. Timna. I hope you're doing well. The first and foremost is we need some clarity around the tariff structure before we do anything with the U.S. or Canadian assets or European assets. We need clarity around tariffs. And then you hit upon one that is big alumina prices. So as we look at potential -- the metal price may support additional capacity in a place like Lista, especially if we can get European energy prices at a reasonable level. But really factoring alumina, there's an opportunity cost of consuming alumina in a place like Lista that we can turn around and sell at $570 a tonne. So as we always do, once we get clarity around the tariffs, we'll factor in exchange rates, alumina prices, aluminum prices, and most importantly, energy prices to make a determination, specifically around Lista and Warrick. Those are the two places that we have excess capacity that could be restarted.\nTimna Tanners: Okay, helpful. Thank you. I also wanted to touch base on your technology initiatives as far as CapEx use. I know in the past, those were a big focus and there wasn't much emphasis in this presentation on some of the initiatives you've detailed in the past. So any update can you provide for us? Would those be kind of in line for capital uses or are they pushed out a bit? Thanks.\nWilliam Oplinger: So before Molly answers the numbers question, I do want to give you some insight into our thinking around our three key technology programs. ELYSIS in 2024 was a little bit of a disappointment in that it did not deliver the start of 450 Ka cells in 2024. We anticipate that in 2025, we will have a 450 Ka cell started in ELYSIS. So that's the anticipation there. When I look at Australia, we're making progress in Australia. We've gone from really a desktop-sized cell to a much larger cell, not commercially sized, not by any stretch, but we are stepping up the cell size in Australia. We're doing that at the Alcoa Technical Center. And then in the refinery side, we are making progress on key technologies, for instance, electric calcination that are promising. And so we're seeing that technology and looking at how we can apply it to our existing refineries to have a step change in both energy usage and carbon emissions. So Molly, do you want to address the dollar question?\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. Timna, we do not have significant technology dollars. I don't have the Australia-specific rate handy but recall it's around $15 million.\nWilliam Oplinger: And ELYSIS?\nMolly Beerman: No ELYSIS, CapEx.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Thank you. Helpful.\nOperator: The next question is from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBennett Moore: Good afternoon. This is Bennett on for Bill. If I could circle back to San Ciprián real quick, wondering what the feedback has been from the union and workforce regarding the MOU and proposed JV. Is this at all a bottleneck moving forward?\nWilliam Oplinger: So the MOU is really fresh, right? And so we had meetings with our employees and informed them of the MOU, but we are also being very balanced in the discussion around the MOU. The MOU is, as I said, as I characterized it, is a real step forward in that we have support from the national and the regional governments. But there are still certain things that need to come into place in order for us to guarantee the restart of the smelter. So that's the communication that we've had with our employees and with the unions. And they've heard that directly from us at this point.\nBennett Moore: Thanks for that. And then on permitting in Western Australia, has that public comment period begun? And what are the next milestones we should watch for after that?\nWilliam Oplinger: Go ahead, Molly.\nMolly Beerman: So the public comment period, we expect to commence towards the end of the first quarter and go into the second quarter. At this point, we're still on track for our approvals in 2026, and then the mine move and access to the upgraded bauxite no earlier than '27.\nBennett Moore: Thank you. Congrats on a great quarter.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for his closing remarks.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Gary, and thank you, all, for joining our call. Molly and I look forward to sharing further progress when we speak again in April. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "fullTranscript": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Alcoa Corporation Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation and Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Louis Langlois, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.\nLouis Langlois: Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, Alcoa Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly. As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted in this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you, Louis, and welcome everyone to our third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Alcoa had a strong third quarter. We maintained our fast pace of execution on our strategic priorities, while progressing operational excellence with safety, stability, and continuous improvement. Underlying the strength of our performance are positive market trends in both the near and long-term. Let's start with safety. First and foremost, we had no fatal or serious injuries in the third quarter. I firmly believe that a strong safety culture supports operational excellence. We've continued our positive trend in both leading and lagging indicators by focusing on the behaviors that drive safety performance. Operational stability is evidenced by our aluminum production increasing for the eight straight quarter, starting in the fourth quarter of 2022, with year-to-date production records for our Mosjoen and Canadian smelters. In fact, the Mosjoen smelter in Norway achieved its fourth consecutive quarterly production record. We also steadily improved stability at the Alumar smelter in Brazil, currently operating at nearly 80% capacity. We are working through the approval process for the next major Australian mine regions, Mayar North, Holyoke with the Western Australia Environmental Protection Agency and the Australian Federal Bilateral Assessment Process. Additionally, we have continued to deliver on our strategic actions during the quarter. We completed the acquisition of Alumina Limited on August 1st, and we are already realizing benefits from this transaction on several fronts. The acquisition resulted in increased economic exposure to the aluminum market, which is currently experiencing the highest pricing since 2018. The transaction was accretive to third quarter results with the elimination of net income attributable to non-controlling interest after the closing date. Alcoa also benefited from the absence of related cash distributions. The consolidation of the tax structure of the two companies will result in cash tax savings of approximately $100 million over the next 12 months to 18 months. The added flexibility in our financial decision making enabled us to move quicker on the sale of our 25.1% stake in the Ma’aden joint ventures, which we expect to close in the first half of 2025. The Ma’aden transaction is consistent with our ongoing strategy to optimize and simplify our current portfolio and business. It highlights significant value for a non-core asset. Additionally, the sale of the JV interest allows Alcoa to avoid any future capital calls for their growth. The transaction also provides us with enhanced financial visibility and flexibility. With Ma’aden’s publicly traded shares, our shareholders will be able to see the changing value this investment represents on our balance sheet. If needed to avoid volatility, we may explore alternatives to hedge the value of our investment within the parameters of our contractual lockup periods. Now I'll turn it over to Molly to take us through the financials.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you, Bill. Revenue was flat sequentially at $2.9 billion. In the Aluminum segment, third-party revenue increased 9% on higher average realized third-party price, partially offset by lower shipments. In the Aluminum segment, third-party revenue decreased 5%, primarily due to lower shipments. Third quarter net income attributable to Alcoa was $90 million versus the prior quarter of $20 million, with earnings per common share improving by $0.27 to $0.38 per share. On an adjusted basis, the net earnings attributable to Alcoa was $135 million or $0.57 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $130 million to $455 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA increase was primarily due to higher average realized third-party prices for alumina, improved energy and raw material costs and lower other costs, only partially offset by lower metal prices. The Alumina segment increased $181 million, primarily as higher alumina prices more than offset higher production costs, raw material, energy and other costs. The Aluminum segment decreased $53 million, primarily due to higher alumina costs, lower metal prices, decreased shipments and only partially offset by raw material, energy and production cost improvements. Outside the segments, other corporate costs decreased. Intersegment eliminations were unfavorable in the quarter, which was expected as the higher average alumina price requires more inventory profit elimination. Let's look at cash movements within the third quarter on the next slide. Year-to-date through September, capital expenditures and working capital changes continue to be our largest uses of cash. Within the third quarter working capital change, accounts receivable came down as lower aluminum sales prices outweighed the higher alumina sales price impacts. However, inventories in both segments rose, primarily due to timing of shipments of alumina. Accounts payable was lower due to timing of payments and impacts from the Kwinana curtailment. Overall, this resulted in an increase in working capital compared to the second quarter. Third quarter cash flows included approximately $85 million in restructuring payments, primarily related to the Kwinana curtailment. We continue to progress our profitability improvement programs. We have taken actions to deliver approximately $525 million of the $645 million savings target as of the end of the third quarter. Overall, the improvements are apparent in the year-to-date year-over-year bridge by program or location. During the third quarter, we added $175 million to the second quarter's year-to-date progress of $350 million. Through September 30th, the company overachieved its $310 million target on raw materials with approximately $355 million in savings and we expect to expand those savings in the fourth quarter. Within our productivity and competitiveness program through September 30th, we implemented actions contributing to approximately $45 million of savings and expect to deliver the $100 million run rate target by the end of the first quarter of 2025. We have also progressed our portfolio improvements. To date, Warrick has achieved $45 million of its $60 million target. We are still awaiting further clarification from the U.S. Treasury on the inclusion of Direct Materials in Section 45X of the IRA program, which we estimate could be worth approximately $30 million. The Alumar smelter restart has achieved approximately $60 million of its $75 million target and is currently operating at nearly 80% capacity. The Kwinana curtailment has been slow to deliver savings due to high transition and holding costs, but we are still targeting $70 million in improvements on a run rate basis by the end of 2025. Moving on to other key financial metrics. The year-to-date return on equity turned positive to 0.6%. Days working capital increased four days to 45 days sequentially, primarily due to an increase in inventory days on timing of shipments. Our third quarter dividend added $26 million to stockholder capital returns, including newly issued shares for the acquisition of Alumina Limited. Free cash flow less debt non-controlling interest distributions was nearly neutral for the quarter, resulting in a cash balance of $1.3 billion. As we look ahead to 2025, delevering and repositioning debt to the jurisdictions where cash is needed will be a priority for us. Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Our full year outlook has several adjustments. We are increasing the outlook for alumina shipments to 12.9 million to 13.1 million tons, that is an increase of approximately 200,000 tons. The production outlook for alumina remains the same as most of the shipping increase is related to trading tons where there is low margin. While we expect transformation expense to improve $10 million to $70 million, we also expect other corporate expense to increase $20 million to $160 million. Depreciation expense is changing from $675 million to approximately $655 million, primarily due to changes in capital project completion dates. Return-seeking capital is changing from $110 million to approximately $135 million as we continue to consider several return-seeking projects with attractive rates of return, primarily related to production Creek projects and additional value-add product capabilities. Environmental and ARO payments are improving from $295 million to approximately $265 million. Regarding sequential changes for the fourth quarter, in the Alumina segment, we expect favorable impact of approximately $30 million from higher shipments and lower production costs. In the Aluminum segment, we expect performance to be flat, maintaining the strong performance from the third quarter. While the higher price of alumina will increase overall Alcoa adjusted EBITDA, alumina cost in the Aluminum segment is expected to be unfavorable by $80 million. Beyond the standard sensitivity provided for intersegment profit elimination, we expect an additional $30 million of expense in the fourth quarter due to the higher profit retained in inventory related to changes in production costs and volumes. Below EBITDA, we expect other expenses to increase approximately $20 million related to equity losses in Ma'aden and an equity contribution to LSS. Based on last week's pricing, we expect fourth quarter operational tax expense to approximate $120 million to $130 million. As the first full quarter since completing the Alumina Limited acquisition, net income attributable to non-controlling interest will be zero. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Molly. Let's start with an update on the markets. The alumina price increased further in the third quarter to the highest since 2018, as supply disruptions continued in a tight market. So far this year, alumina buyers have faced force majeure in Queensland, Australia related to gas supply, force majeure in Jamaica after hurricane impacts and the curtailment of our Kwinana refinery in Australia. Recent events in India have also raised questions of whether there could be even further disruptions this year, but no impacts have been confirmed there yet. Demand remained strong from continued smelter production growth and relatively low alumina inventory levels at smelters, which is also contributing to the tightness in the market. Meanwhile, in the bauxite market, we have seen tightness in China due to safety and environmental inspections in Northern China, along with continued depletion of ore reserves. As a result, seaborne bauxite imports there continued to grow this year. Looking ahead to the aluminum market for next year, for the market to come back into balance, both the resolution of the recent disruptions and the ramp-up of scheduled projects in Indonesia and India will be needed. In aluminum, global demand is at record levels. Specifically in North America and Europe, the Packaging segment is recovering. The transportation market overall has been steady with some slowing of growth within the automotive sector. For building and construction, it has been a challenging year, but rate cuts in Europe and in the U.S. are likely to provide some support for a recovery in the future. Global aluminum supply is growing, but with limited new projects in the pipeline. China is approaching its 45 million metric ton production capacity cap, making any significant net supply growth from China unlikely and meeting supply growth instead will have to come from outside of China. In addition, China announced that is now including aluminum in its national emissions trading scheme, which sets national carbon pricing. While we don't expect to see immediate impacts from this development, it does send a message that is likely that the Chinese primary aluminum industry, which makes up over half of global primary aluminum production will be subject to carbon emissions pricing, increasing costs there in the future. In summary, we believe the market environment remains positive for alumina and aluminum. Alcoa is well-positioned to benefit from being one of the world's largest bauxite and alumina producers, and from offering a diversified portfolio of aluminum products that are used across several end markets that are experiencing growth. The benefits of our significant alumina market exposure are starting to become more apparent, not only in this pricing environment, but in relation to the additional economic exposure gained through the Alumina Limited acquisition. Prior to the acquisition of Alumina Limited, Alcoa had economic exposure through third-party sales to only 2 million metric tons of production. We had 60% of the approximately 10 million metric tons produced in total, but used 4 million metric tons of that to supply our aluminum smelters. Post acquisition, Alcoa has economic exposure to approximately 6 million metric tons of production available for third-party sales. With our first quartile bauxite and alumina portfolio, we’re in a very strong position to take advantage of the near and long-term market fundamentals, as well as longer-term strategic opportunities like our recently announced extension of the alumina supply contract with Alba. The 10-year agreement provides up to 16.5 million metric tons of smelter grade alumina to Alba. Our operations in Australia are well-positioned to serve Alba. This contract also strengthens our position as the premier global alumina supplier and enhances our ability to manage our long alumina position. Turning to our Spain operations. Earlier this year, we announced a dual-path approach to address the challenging economics of the complex. The launch of a sale process while also working to identify solutions for the long-term viability of the operations. Following a robust sale process that included 60 potential investors, no viable offer emerged. However, through the sale process, one party emerged the IGNIS Group which was known to Alcoa through prior dealings in Spain's energy market. Together, Alcoa and IGNIS developed an alternative through which both organizations could leverage their individual expertise. Our capabilities in managing global aluminum operations and IGNIS in leveraging their energy market expertise to create value via market access and energy management services. We are working toward entering into a strategic cooperation agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, IGNIS would become a 25% owner in our Spanish operations. The owners would make initial investments of EUR100 million, EUR75 million from Alcoa, and EUR25 million from IGNIS. Additionally, if required, up to EUR100 million would be funded by Alcoa, with a priority position in future cash returns. If additional funding is required, it must be agreed by both partners and will be shared 75% by Alcoa and 25% by IGNIS. However, this proposed partnership is conditional upon delivery of key items by national and local governments, works council and employees. These include materially higher CO2 compensation, permitting of power generation projects, support and approval for the residue storage area capital project and flexibility within the smelter viability agreement such as the ability to use restricted cash to meet operating needs until competitive power is developed and provided under the signed PPAs. We are now focusing on making the partnership a success with the critical support from key stakeholders. Our last strategic update is related to our Australian mine approvals. We are currently progressing approvals along the time line shown for the next major Western Australian mine regions, Myara North and Holyoake through the WA EPA and Federal bilateral assessment process. It’s an extensive process that started in 2020, and we are focused on receiving ministerial approval by early 2026. We anticipate mining in the new regions will commence no earlier than 2027. Until then, we expect bauxite quality will remain similar to recent grades. The WA EPA recently said its indicative time line for the next key step in the process, the public comment period for early 2025. We are committed to working with the WA EPA and other stakeholders to achieve the indicative time line. Our Board has been and continues to engage with a range of stakeholders regarding our current and future operations. We have community engagement forms in place that provide an opportunity for two way discussion between Alcoa and host community members. This includes the recently established forum for the dwelling up community, which is near the future Holyoake mine region. As we plan for future operations, we are assessing what conditions may be applied of their approval process by examining our operations closely as well as by learning from the experience of our peers operating in the region. In 2023, we accepted and incorporated new conditions addressing key environmental factors that include enhanced protections for drinking water and increased mining distances from reservoirs, avoidance of key biodiversity areas and accelerating forest rehabilitation. By incorporating these conditions into our current operations, we believe they provide a strong foundation for what may be recommended in the assessment. Throughout all of these engagements, Alcoa's goal is to be recognized as a responsible miner and maintain the right to mine for long-term operations. We're focused on modernizing the approvals framework for bauxite mining in WA and securing certainty for our operations and all stakeholders. As a company, we are proud of the progress we made in the third quarter on multiple fronts. Looking ahead, we will maintain a fast pace of execution on strategic initiatives, improved productivity and stability across our operations and capitalize on positive market fundamentals to deliver value to our stockholders is shaping up to be an action-packed year. Operator, let's start the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTimna Tanners: Yes. Thank you and congrats on all the progress.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Timna.\nTimna Tanners: So many questions. Thanks. I guess I'll just ask about Spain. So just trying to understand, have you got approvals or initial response from either the union or the government? And assumedly, would you ramp up production to optimize profitability? What do they bring to the table? What's your level of profitability at spot?\nWilliam Oplinger: Yeah. Let me just address a few of those. What the partnership, first of all, we're trying to achieve a partnership. We haven't finalized the partnership yet, but our efforts on achieving the partnership are meant to bring IGNIS’ knowledge and expertise in the energy markets, combined with our knowledge and expertise around aluminum. And so around your question, specifically, if have we talked to the stakeholders, the reason for the announcement today is to launch that discussion with the stakeholders and to make sure that they understand that we need cooperations and make the site viable. We specifically in the announcement, talked about a number of things, CO2 compensation, permitting of power projects, the access to some of the restricted cash, that will allow us to chart a path forward that makes that plant viable. But it's conditional, the partnership is conditional on getting those -- that cooperation. And so that's what we'll be working on over the next couple of months.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. So I know I asked a lot of questions, but I just -- I guess it would be helpful to get a flavor on your confidence maybe or on their approval and what the plan B might be, I suppose, if you don't achieve those? And if you could comment on the plans to run that more full utilization, that would be great, too? Thanks.\nWilliam Oplinger: Yeah. And if I step back and just address how we got here, we were going down a dual path process where we were trying to sell the asset and at the same time, trying to make it a viable asset. We went out to 60 potential buyers for the asset, and there was not a viable offer for the entirety of the asset. In that process, IGNIS emerged as a potential partner for us to essentially combine their expertise and our expertise. In the partnership, they will be making a EUR25 million contribution to the site, they will end up owning 25% of the site, and we would hope to be able to work with the stakeholders so that we can get the support that we need. As far as my confidence, we're confident. We have made it this far. We had very good interaction with IGNIS, and we’re confident that we can get that – the partnership. Now the question will be sitting down and making sure that the stakeholders understand the need for the support that we’re looking for to ensure the solvency and the viability of the site.\nTimna Tanners: Thanks.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you, Timna.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChristopher LaFemina: Hey, thanks, operator. Just a follow-up question on the San Ciprian situation. So if my understanding is correct, you're committing up to EUR175 million of additional investment in the business. But is this sort of like it was before, where that's the limit as to how far you'll go or is it possible that you will fund significantly more than that? And I guess what I'm really getting at is what is the endgame? I mean, obviously, if it's a viable asset, well, then it could have a place within Alcoa. But what if we go back to kind of lower price environment, how does that play out for you? What are the options there?\nWilliam Oplinger: The end game here is to try to make it a viable asset. And the only way we get to that end game is that we have support from the unions and the government when you consider that EUR175 million that Alcoa would be putting in, we will be looking for government support of the CO2 compensation of approximately $80 million. In addition to that, there is a restricted cash in the site, which is about $85 million, and we'd be looking to access that to fund the operations. So that's at least two of the things we need to get in order to get the survivable operation. As we look forward, things can change in Europe. Clearly, you've got CBAM (ph) coming in. Energy markets are changing fairly quickly. So what we would be looking to do is to try to get that support in order to make those investments and have a site that's viable. Anything you want to add, Molly?\nMolly Beerman: Just on the $80 million of the CO2 compensation, that actually relates to the past. We did not receive our compensation for 2018 through 2021 when we were running the smelter. And so we've had claims against the government. We'd like to have those listed and have access to that $80 million since we ran and paid all of the employees.\nWilliam Oplinger: And just to make it clear to tie it all together, the $175 million, we would be using the $80 million, in the $85 million towards that contribution of $175 million.\nChristopher LaFemina: That's helpful. Thank you. And sorry, second, Molly, just on the profitability improvement program. Did you say that you're tracking ahead of some of the cost reductions there? And does that imply that, that $645 million target might ultimately be conservative or are we kind of sticking with that as being the most likely outcome?\nMolly Beerman: Chris, we are ahead on the raw materials, and that was a year-over-year target, so we're going to try to close off each piece of the program as we accomplish it. We are working very diligently now on setting a really aggressive 2025 plan. We recognize that any of these special programs take a lot of time and energy Alcoan’s are used to working toward an aggressive plan, have every bit of savings and productivity identified by person at delivery. So we will work on this program and close it off as we accomplish each piece. And then we're going to move forward into 2025 with a really aggressive budget.\nWilliam Oplinger: And if I could tag on to that comment, Molly. We're trying to change the culture so that our company folks across the entirety of the company, both within the plants and in our resource units are focused very highly on competitiveness. So you've heard us talk about advancing competitiveness and some of the targets that we've had, we're trying to make sure that this is not a one-off program that this becomes part of the culture where each plant, each resource unit is focused on increasing the overall competitiveness of the plant in comparison to plants around the world.\nChristopher LaFemina: Great. Thank you. Good luck. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you very much operator, and I want to add my congratulations on the progress across many fronts. I have one more question on San Ciprian. During the past that the power component was always a challenge there. And I wondered if you could maybe elaborate to what extent the potential partnership would alleviate that previous choke point? Thank you very much.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Lucas. That's a great question. And the reason why it's a great question is because power in Spain is still a problem. When you compare power in Spain versus Germany and France, Spain is fundamentally uncompetitive. And so that's where we need to ensure that we get the highest level of CO2 compensation available to us and any assistance we can get in areas like transmission costs. When you look at smelter in France, for instance, they get the maximum CO2 credit, they get the maximum assistance and transmission costs, which allows a smelter in France of all places to be competitive. We need the same type of thing in Spain. And as far as what IGNIS can help us with is really understanding underlying power markets trying to help us with some of those issues like CO2 compensation transmission costs and try to get us a competitive power situation, at least in the near term, while Europe works through some of the things like CBAM and the energy situation there.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you very much for that color. Very helpful. Bill, I'd like to ask you a bit about the alumina markets, obviously, very strong pricing dynamics, lots of disruptions around the world. And I wondered if you could maybe go through some of the discrete pressure points on the supply side and share your opinion on how quickly they might be resolved? And maybe also separate from that, where else you might see constraints on alumina medium term? Thank you very much.\nWilliam Oplinger: Yes. Alumina is acutely tight currently. I think on our chart, we showed something like $650, I think alumina prices reached close to $700 today, and there is very little liquidity in the market for shipping alumina currently. I'm sure that if I go through the list of disruptions, I'll probably miss one, so let me do it off the top of my head, we curtail the Kwinana facility earlier in the year. There was good strategic rationale for curtailing it with high cost, high complexity refinery, and we made that happen safely in the first half of the year. Subsequent to that, one of our competitors in Northern Australia had a pipeline issue. If you look at their numbers year-over-year, they are recovering from that, but are still not back at 100% capacity. One of our competitors in Jamaica had a storm roll through. They first said there was no impact, subsequently declared force majeure and so there was an impact there. I believe that's been largely remedy. And just this week, you probably heard some discussion probably saw a Bloomberg article about disruption around bauxite in Guinea. We don't know anything more about that than what you're reading in the press, but that puts further stress on the market. As we look forward to 2025, our view would have been that 2025 would come into balance at some point on alumina. However, in order to come into balance, a couple of things have to occur. Those disruptions need to be cleared up and not recur. And secondly, we’re going to need to see growth in Indonesia and India. And I guess speaking of India, that was the one I missed. You probably all saw at one of the competitors, a runoff water storage pond that collapse that may have had an impact on their production. So in order for the aluminum market to come back in the balance, we would need to see growth in those areas, and our view is that alumina will stay tight through the first half of next year.\nLucas Pipes: Bill, I really appreciate all the color to you and the team continued. Best of luck.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Peterson: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and nice job on the quarterly execution. I want to come back to San Ciprian and just maybe a little bit finer point. So I guess where alumina is today, how does this inform your refinery restart? And I guess how does this tie in maybe potential with negotiations with the unions and local governments. I guess on the government side, what are you looking for? Is this about the commitments to the renewable projects, the competitive PPAs? Just any sort of color you can provide on those?\nWilliam Oplinger: So let me answer the second part first, and that will give me to forget the first part. The second part, essentially, what we're looking for, we laid out in the press release, and that is CO2 compensation, as Molly said for past production, that's about $80 million, and we are looking for a permit for the uplift of the RDA at San Ciprian. We need to uplift the RDA to 104 meters, and so we're looking to get that. On top of that, from the unions, we would like to be able to access the restricted cash, the cash that's there to fund the operating expenses as we go forward. Molly, that I'm missing.\nMolly Beerman: Just within the government discussions, we're also talking about the permits. We do not have all the development permits or I should say, our -- the suppliers under our PPAs don't have all the permits to develop.\nWilliam Oplinger: Yeah. Good point. And as far as our thinking around ramping up the refinery, we really need to get the permits to do that uplift to the 104 meters in San Ciprian. And we'll be tracking those permits as they come in. And then once we have that, we'll make the determination then on whether to increase production at San Ciprian.\nWilliam Peterson: Yeah. Thanks for that, Molly. And maybe the next one for Molly. On the outlined, I guess, $120 million in the remaining savings over the next, I guess, 12 months to 15 months, and it sounds like you're going to come up with a 2025 plan, but can you elaborate on where the remaining savings are coming from as well as the cadence of the savings through the balance of next year?\nMolly Beerman: So I mentioned that on raw materials were over -- already overachieved and we'll actually add a little bit more in the fourth quarter there. On our productivity and competitiveness program, we are through $45 million of actions, and that's to get the $100 million run rate, and that's by the end of the first quarter of '25. Warwick, we're going after 60. We've achieved about $45 million through the third quarter. We have zero on the IRA waiting that decision. And then on the Alumar smelter, we're through 60 of 75 and that will go into next year to get the rest of that. And then Kwinana is the one where we are, I think, operating probably a bit behind target. We've only captured $20 million of the 70 (ph). We're keeping the target. We will go after that, but that will come more towards the end of 2025.\nWilliam Peterson: Very helpful. Thank you, Molly.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good afternoon or evening, gentlemen and Molly.\nWilliam Oplinger: Hey, Mike.\nMichael Dudas: Hey, Bill. Back to the Alumina market, how do you see a balance on the supply side you talked about for '25, but what about demand? I would think it's near current prices and given where aluminum is, how do you see that for some of the higher cost smelters. Will there be some decisions on that front that could certainly change things a little bit and maybe even on the converse tighten aluminum market further?\nWilliam Oplinger: So as we're seeing demand today, demand actually has on the aluminum side, has been pretty strong. You've seen some restarts in Europe that continue to drive the demand. As far as whether alumina prices will drive demand cuts in aluminum, it can really only speak for us. And we would be looking at all of our smelters and try to determine whether they can continue to be profitable at these levels and how long those higher alumina costs will stick around. So we have a pretty regular cadence of review of the profitability of our marginal smelters, and we go through that on a regular basis, and we'll take action if need be.\nMichael Dudas: Understood. Appreciate that. Thanks, Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKatja Jancic: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe starting on -- given the environment is very healthy right now, can you remind us how you're thinking about your capital allocation especially, potentially returning more to shareholders?\nMolly Beerman: Katja, our primary goal for early 2025 is to delever as well as to reposition some of our debt to the jurisdictions that need cash. Our adjusted net debt has gone a bit higher at $2.2 billion. We added about $385 million this quarter with the completion of the Alumina Limited acquisition, so that will be our priority as we approach early '25.\nWilliam Oplinger: Katja, if you look back over the last five years, I think one of the greatest ways for us to release equity value is to pay down debt. We're a bigger company today than we were a year ago. We're a more profitable company today than we were a year ago after the Alumina Limited transaction. But I still believe that bringing down our debt levels is the best way in the near term to release equity value.\nKatja Jancic: And what would be the level you're looking to reach or you would be comfortable at?\nMolly Beerman: We're looking at several options, Katja, but we're not ready to guide on that yet.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. And if I may, just one more. Given the strength in the alumina market and the fact that there seems to be some durability expected in the prices. Are there any opportunities where you could besides San Ciprian increased production or debottleneck on your side?\nWilliam Oplinger: Short answer is largely no. I mean we are working on debottlenecking in Brazil, but that's taking some time. We constantly look at opportunities to creep our sites and to try to generate additional tons, but really no large step outs that we could execute upon quickly to take advantage of the higher prices.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. Thank you.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from John Tumazos with Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you for taking my question.\nWilliam Oplinger: Hey, John.\nJohn Tumazos: Bill, I was playing with my Excel spreadsheet, and I plugged in $575 for the fourth quarter on Alumina price and a $10 lower unit cost and $625 million popped out for EBITDA for the Alumina segment, and if some like that happen, maybe the aluminum metal segment was to transfer pricing would fall towards $100 million. So is it in the ballpark that we might see $175 million gain in EBITDA in the fourth quarter, if the attorneys will let you answer that question?\nWilliam Oplinger: Hey, John. I'll take a swing at this and Molly is much better at this. But essentially, start with our third quarter, take our sensitivities and apply our sensitivities, put in your estimate a price that you think will last during the fourth quarter. And then we give guidance around the strength of the fourth quarter on some qualitative items. So what did we say qualitatively. We said aluminum will be better by about $30 million, $30 million in the fourth quarter. I'm really happy about that. I would like to see Alumina get even better in 2025. But it's a very good start. Aluminum is relatively flat on a fourth quarter to third quarter basis. And then I think Molly guided to a little bit of an impact of change in their company profit elimination, with the rapid run-up of prices that we're seeing. Sometimes our sensitivities don't always work perfectly. And then when we see that, we try to make sure that you can build it into your model. So once you've done all that, it spits out an EBITDA level, and we'll let you make a determination whether you think it's realistic or not. Thanks.\nJohn Tumazos: Bill, can I ask a second one?\nWilliam Oplinger: Sure.\nJohn Tumazos: And actually, a little bit tongue in cheek and a little bit serious, I've sat in 3 hour geology seminars about the Nubian Shield or the Red Sea Basin, where the Saudi Arabian Peninsula is considered a very hot area for gold and copper geology. Ivanhoe (ph) is exploring for copper, Barrick for gold there. Should we view the $950 million of Ma’aden equity and the majority of their profits are phosphate, a long-term play on the phosphate market, and gold and copper exploration in the Nubian Shield or do you think it's something that you might sell as soon as the holding period expires?\nWilliam Oplinger: That's a great question, John. And let me just take the opportunity to give you a little bit of background. We announced the transaction that we were selling the 25.1% for $1.1 billion. The consideration is $150 million cash and $950 million of Ma'aden stock, that stock will be locked up on a lockup period that's a three-year, four-year to five-year staggered lockup period. Since the time of that announcement was the run-up in the Ma’aden stock, that transaction goes from being worth $1.1 billion to over $1.3 billion. So, so far, we're pretty happy, but it's early days. We did that transaction for two reasons. One, we wanted to simplify the organizational structure. We did not think that the Street gave us much value for the ownership of the 25.1% and probably rightfully so. And then secondly, we wanted to be able to crystallize and highlight that value on something that you can see on your screen on a daily basis to see how we -- how much we own there. As far as whether we will see shares in years three, four and five, we'll make that determination then. In the meantime, we have a great relationship with Ma'aden. I personally have a great relationship with many folks in the Kingdom, and we're super supportive of them being successful on phosphate, copper, gold and aluminum.\nJohn Tumazos: Whenever your production for metal is reported going forward, should we add 228,000 tons for 2026 for the Spanish restart and then deduct 175,000 tons because you sold the Ma'aden piece.\nMolly Beerman: So John, I would wait until we get our partnership structure in place, and we'll be able to give more guidance on what the restart ramp-up will look like. In terms of Ma'aden, I have the offtake margin handy, but I don't have the volume of tons. So we have been taking offtake, and that will stop with the completion of the transaction, that is not a huge margin to us. It's about $6 million per quarter. But again, when we give our guidance in January on the 2025 shipments and production, we will adjust at that point to remove it.\nJohn Tumazos: Do you count it as production or not?\nMolly Beerman: Just shipments, I believe, yes, shipments.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nWilliam Oplinger: Yeah. We don't count as production. We count on a shipments because we have an offtake with the joint venture that gets sold onwards. So it’s in our shipments number but not our production number.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you for your patience with all my questions.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, John. Good to hear from you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCarlos De Alba: Yeah. Thank you very much, Bill and Molly. On San Ciprian, is there a new timetable or a timetable for you to complete the discussions with the government and the union in order for you to determine whether you go ahead with this agreement that you are trying to close. Just would like to get a little bit of sense of time as to how much longer can this negotiation take before you're ready to really turn the page or continue operating from Ciprian asset?\nWilliam Oplinger: Not a significant change to the timetable that we've lined out before. The entities will run out of cash, we believe somewhere around the end of the year, potentially that could go a little bit further into 2025, depending on what market conditions are. So we're essentially pushing as hard as we can, as quickly as we can to ensure that we get the right level of cooperation from the various stakeholders and get the partnership consummated.\nCarlos De Alba: Okay. And just if the companies run out of cash, at that point in time, you basically file for bankruptcy or stop close shop? Is that what will happen?\nWilliam Oplinger: We're really focused on trying to make sure that, that doesn't happen, Carlos. But essentially, the entity is technically insolvent at that point. And so some -- as we've said before, some hard decisions will have to be made. What we're trying to do is avoid that.\nCarlos De Alba: Okay. All right. Thanks. And just on CapEx, is the second quarter I think in a row that CapEx goes up or return-seeking CapEx increases. Any -- not huge amounts, but anyway, increases. Any details or any color as to how much incremental either volumes or EBITDA can we expect from this project, these additional projects?\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. Carlos, we don’t have those figures handy. I don’t think you’ll find it to be notable though from this current set. These are a series of smaller projects that we’re approving now.\nCarlos De Alba: All right. Okay. Thank you very much. All the best.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Lachlan Shaw with UBS. Please go ahead.\nLachlan Shaw: Good afternoon, Bill and Molly. Thanks for your time. Just one question from me. So just on WA and the mine approval process there. I'm just interested, I suppose, how you think about that whole process and the scenarios potentially ahead of you given the experience of your peer there and the conditional approvals that sort of came through for them. I mean how do you think about what that -- what those scenarios might look like in the context of the environmental authorities in Australia generally pushing for more stringent conditions. Thank you.\nWilliam Oplinger: So Lachlan, thanks for the question. We're continuing to advance the mine approvals for both Myara North and Holyoake that process started in 2020, and we're focused on receiving our approvals by early 2026. And we're anticipating that mining in the new regions will commence no earlier than 2027. Recently, the WA EPA set the time line for the next major step in the approval process, and that's the public comment period that will occur in the first quarter of 2025. At the same time, we continue to work on our annual approvals from the WA state government for our rolling five year mine plan. So we continue to make good progress. We're committed -- very committed to making sure that we work collaboratively, I can't say that, we're collaboratively with the WA EPA and the other stakeholders. So we think we're making really good progress there. As far as your question around our neighbors in WA South32, we have looked at some of their conditions, and we acknowledge that there are some similarities between the activities between the two companies. But we continue to work through the -- a review of their process. And we think that we will learn a lot through that process. And we think we're actually in pretty good shape. So I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that, Molly.\nMolly Beerman: I'd just add that, remember, last year, when we were going through the approvals process for our annual mine plan, we adopted a whole series of new mining requirements. So many of the conditions that you see being added to South32 now, we've already done that. So we did go through their whole list. We looked at them the majority we had either already built into our current mine plans or had them incorporated in our new mine plans and some of those that were different are simply because we're mining in different areas. Some of the other South32, it's important to recognize that some of their cost increases are related to their carbon management. We are running natural gas, so we do not face the same kind of cost challenges. The safeguard mechanism that will be running in Australia is based on the industry standard. And if you look at our Pinjarra refinery, for example, we’re already at the industry best. So we have a different cost profile there as well.\nLachlan Shaw: That’s great color. Thanks again\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Lachlan.\nOperator: And our next question is a follow-up from Timna Tanners of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Oplinger: Hi, Timna.\nTimna Tanners: Yeah. Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up on the capital allocation line of questions because I know that Molly in the prepared remarks noted some ability to continue to pursue perhaps some value-add or additional projects. And just back of the envelope, higher alumina prices in these commodity prices obviously, paying down debt is great use of cash, I get it. But is there anything else you can elaborate on regard the opportunities if indeed you have greater cash and cash generation into next year?\nMolly Beerman: Timna, we will certainly look at excess cash, and we will put it through our capital allocation framework. So we will look at returns to shareholders. We'll look at other growth opportunities, and we'll also look at additional portfolio actions, but we will wait to see how the cash is coming in through the rest of this year and to early next year along with those delevering plans that I mentioned.\nWilliam Oplinger: And it’s important to remember that at the beginning of the year, we issued $750 million of debt. We also took on an additional roughly $350 million debt in the Alumina transaction. As I said earlier, we are a bigger company. We should be a better company. But in the near term, we think there’s a lot of value – equity value created by delevering.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for closing remarks.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you for joining our call. Molly and I look forward to sharing further progress when we speak again in January. That concludes our call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Louis Langlois, Senior Vice President of Treasury and Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.\nLouis Langlois: Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by William Oplinger, Alcoa Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Molly Beerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Bill and Molly. As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. For historical non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. We have not presented quantitative reconciliations of certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for reasons noted in this slide. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings press release and slide presentation are available on our website. Now, I'd like to turn over the call to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you, Louis, and welcome everyone to our third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Alcoa had a strong third quarter. We maintained our fast pace of execution on our strategic priorities, while progressing operational excellence with safety, stability, and continuous improvement. Underlying the strength of our performance are positive market trends in both the near and long-term. Let's start with safety. First and foremost, we had no fatal or serious injuries in the third quarter. I firmly believe that a strong safety culture supports operational excellence. We've continued our positive trend in both leading and lagging indicators by focusing on the behaviors that drive safety performance. Operational stability is evidenced by our aluminum production increasing for the eight straight quarter, starting in the fourth quarter of 2022, with year-to-date production records for our Mosjoen and Canadian smelters. In fact, the Mosjoen smelter in Norway achieved its fourth consecutive quarterly production record. We also steadily improved stability at the Alumar smelter in Brazil, currently operating at nearly 80% capacity. We are working through the approval process for the next major Australian mine regions, Mayar North, Holyoke with the Western Australia Environmental Protection Agency and the Australian Federal Bilateral Assessment Process. Additionally, we have continued to deliver on our strategic actions during the quarter. We completed the acquisition of Alumina Limited on August 1st, and we are already realizing benefits from this transaction on several fronts. The acquisition resulted in increased economic exposure to the aluminum market, which is currently experiencing the highest pricing since 2018. The transaction was accretive to third quarter results with the elimination of net income attributable to non-controlling interest after the closing date. Alcoa also benefited from the absence of related cash distributions. The consolidation of the tax structure of the two companies will result in cash tax savings of approximately $100 million over the next 12 months to 18 months. The added flexibility in our financial decision making enabled us to move quicker on the sale of our 25.1% stake in the Ma’aden joint ventures, which we expect to close in the first half of 2025. The Ma’aden transaction is consistent with our ongoing strategy to optimize and simplify our current portfolio and business. It highlights significant value for a non-core asset. Additionally, the sale of the JV interest allows Alcoa to avoid any future capital calls for their growth. The transaction also provides us with enhanced financial visibility and flexibility. With Ma’aden’s publicly traded shares, our shareholders will be able to see the changing value this investment represents on our balance sheet. If needed to avoid volatility, we may explore alternatives to hedge the value of our investment within the parameters of our contractual lockup periods. Now I'll turn it over to Molly to take us through the financials.\nMolly Beerman: Thank you, Bill. Revenue was flat sequentially at $2.9 billion. In the Aluminum segment, third-party revenue increased 9% on higher average realized third-party price, partially offset by lower shipments. In the Aluminum segment, third-party revenue decreased 5%, primarily due to lower shipments. Third quarter net income attributable to Alcoa was $90 million versus the prior quarter of $20 million, with earnings per common share improving by $0.27 to $0.38 per share. On an adjusted basis, the net earnings attributable to Alcoa was $135 million or $0.57 per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased $130 million to $455 million. Let's look at the key drivers of EBITDA. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA increase was primarily due to higher average realized third-party prices for alumina, improved energy and raw material costs and lower other costs, only partially offset by lower metal prices. The Alumina segment increased $181 million, primarily as higher alumina prices more than offset higher production costs, raw material, energy and other costs. The Aluminum segment decreased $53 million, primarily due to higher alumina costs, lower metal prices, decreased shipments and only partially offset by raw material, energy and production cost improvements. Outside the segments, other corporate costs decreased. Intersegment eliminations were unfavorable in the quarter, which was expected as the higher average alumina price requires more inventory profit elimination. Let's look at cash movements within the third quarter on the next slide. Year-to-date through September, capital expenditures and working capital changes continue to be our largest uses of cash. Within the third quarter working capital change, accounts receivable came down as lower aluminum sales prices outweighed the higher alumina sales price impacts. However, inventories in both segments rose, primarily due to timing of shipments of alumina. Accounts payable was lower due to timing of payments and impacts from the Kwinana curtailment. Overall, this resulted in an increase in working capital compared to the second quarter. Third quarter cash flows included approximately $85 million in restructuring payments, primarily related to the Kwinana curtailment. We continue to progress our profitability improvement programs. We have taken actions to deliver approximately $525 million of the $645 million savings target as of the end of the third quarter. Overall, the improvements are apparent in the year-to-date year-over-year bridge by program or location. During the third quarter, we added $175 million to the second quarter's year-to-date progress of $350 million. Through September 30th, the company overachieved its $310 million target on raw materials with approximately $355 million in savings and we expect to expand those savings in the fourth quarter. Within our productivity and competitiveness program through September 30th, we implemented actions contributing to approximately $45 million of savings and expect to deliver the $100 million run rate target by the end of the first quarter of 2025. We have also progressed our portfolio improvements. To date, Warrick has achieved $45 million of its $60 million target. We are still awaiting further clarification from the U.S. Treasury on the inclusion of Direct Materials in Section 45X of the IRA program, which we estimate could be worth approximately $30 million. The Alumar smelter restart has achieved approximately $60 million of its $75 million target and is currently operating at nearly 80% capacity. The Kwinana curtailment has been slow to deliver savings due to high transition and holding costs, but we are still targeting $70 million in improvements on a run rate basis by the end of 2025. Moving on to other key financial metrics. The year-to-date return on equity turned positive to 0.6%. Days working capital increased four days to 45 days sequentially, primarily due to an increase in inventory days on timing of shipments. Our third quarter dividend added $26 million to stockholder capital returns, including newly issued shares for the acquisition of Alumina Limited. Free cash flow less debt non-controlling interest distributions was nearly neutral for the quarter, resulting in a cash balance of $1.3 billion. As we look ahead to 2025, delevering and repositioning debt to the jurisdictions where cash is needed will be a priority for us. Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Our full year outlook has several adjustments. We are increasing the outlook for alumina shipments to 12.9 million to 13.1 million tons, that is an increase of approximately 200,000 tons. The production outlook for alumina remains the same as most of the shipping increase is related to trading tons where there is low margin. While we expect transformation expense to improve $10 million to $70 million, we also expect other corporate expense to increase $20 million to $160 million. Depreciation expense is changing from $675 million to approximately $655 million, primarily due to changes in capital project completion dates. Return-seeking capital is changing from $110 million to approximately $135 million as we continue to consider several return-seeking projects with attractive rates of return, primarily related to production Creek projects and additional value-add product capabilities. Environmental and ARO payments are improving from $295 million to approximately $265 million. Regarding sequential changes for the fourth quarter, in the Alumina segment, we expect favorable impact of approximately $30 million from higher shipments and lower production costs. In the Aluminum segment, we expect performance to be flat, maintaining the strong performance from the third quarter. While the higher price of alumina will increase overall Alcoa adjusted EBITDA, alumina cost in the Aluminum segment is expected to be unfavorable by $80 million. Beyond the standard sensitivity provided for intersegment profit elimination, we expect an additional $30 million of expense in the fourth quarter due to the higher profit retained in inventory related to changes in production costs and volumes. Below EBITDA, we expect other expenses to increase approximately $20 million related to equity losses in Ma'aden and an equity contribution to LSS. Based on last week's pricing, we expect fourth quarter operational tax expense to approximate $120 million to $130 million. As the first full quarter since completing the Alumina Limited acquisition, net income attributable to non-controlling interest will be zero. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Molly. Let's start with an update on the markets. The alumina price increased further in the third quarter to the highest since 2018, as supply disruptions continued in a tight market. So far this year, alumina buyers have faced force majeure in Queensland, Australia related to gas supply, force majeure in Jamaica after hurricane impacts and the curtailment of our Kwinana refinery in Australia. Recent events in India have also raised questions of whether there could be even further disruptions this year, but no impacts have been confirmed there yet. Demand remained strong from continued smelter production growth and relatively low alumina inventory levels at smelters, which is also contributing to the tightness in the market. Meanwhile, in the bauxite market, we have seen tightness in China due to safety and environmental inspections in Northern China, along with continued depletion of ore reserves. As a result, seaborne bauxite imports there continued to grow this year. Looking ahead to the aluminum market for next year, for the market to come back into balance, both the resolution of the recent disruptions and the ramp-up of scheduled projects in Indonesia and India will be needed. In aluminum, global demand is at record levels. Specifically in North America and Europe, the Packaging segment is recovering. The transportation market overall has been steady with some slowing of growth within the automotive sector. For building and construction, it has been a challenging year, but rate cuts in Europe and in the U.S. are likely to provide some support for a recovery in the future. Global aluminum supply is growing, but with limited new projects in the pipeline. China is approaching its 45 million metric ton production capacity cap, making any significant net supply growth from China unlikely and meeting supply growth instead will have to come from outside of China. In addition, China announced that is now including aluminum in its national emissions trading scheme, which sets national carbon pricing. While we don't expect to see immediate impacts from this development, it does send a message that is likely that the Chinese primary aluminum industry, which makes up over half of global primary aluminum production will be subject to carbon emissions pricing, increasing costs there in the future. In summary, we believe the market environment remains positive for alumina and aluminum. Alcoa is well-positioned to benefit from being one of the world's largest bauxite and alumina producers, and from offering a diversified portfolio of aluminum products that are used across several end markets that are experiencing growth. The benefits of our significant alumina market exposure are starting to become more apparent, not only in this pricing environment, but in relation to the additional economic exposure gained through the Alumina Limited acquisition. Prior to the acquisition of Alumina Limited, Alcoa had economic exposure through third-party sales to only 2 million metric tons of production. We had 60% of the approximately 10 million metric tons produced in total, but used 4 million metric tons of that to supply our aluminum smelters. Post acquisition, Alcoa has economic exposure to approximately 6 million metric tons of production available for third-party sales. With our first quartile bauxite and alumina portfolio, we’re in a very strong position to take advantage of the near and long-term market fundamentals, as well as longer-term strategic opportunities like our recently announced extension of the alumina supply contract with Alba. The 10-year agreement provides up to 16.5 million metric tons of smelter grade alumina to Alba. Our operations in Australia are well-positioned to serve Alba. This contract also strengthens our position as the premier global alumina supplier and enhances our ability to manage our long alumina position. Turning to our Spain operations. Earlier this year, we announced a dual-path approach to address the challenging economics of the complex. The launch of a sale process while also working to identify solutions for the long-term viability of the operations. Following a robust sale process that included 60 potential investors, no viable offer emerged. However, through the sale process, one party emerged the IGNIS Group which was known to Alcoa through prior dealings in Spain's energy market. Together, Alcoa and IGNIS developed an alternative through which both organizations could leverage their individual expertise. Our capabilities in managing global aluminum operations and IGNIS in leveraging their energy market expertise to create value via market access and energy management services. We are working toward entering into a strategic cooperation agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, IGNIS would become a 25% owner in our Spanish operations. The owners would make initial investments of EUR100 million, EUR75 million from Alcoa, and EUR25 million from IGNIS. Additionally, if required, up to EUR100 million would be funded by Alcoa, with a priority position in future cash returns. If additional funding is required, it must be agreed by both partners and will be shared 75% by Alcoa and 25% by IGNIS. However, this proposed partnership is conditional upon delivery of key items by national and local governments, works council and employees. These include materially higher CO2 compensation, permitting of power generation projects, support and approval for the residue storage area capital project and flexibility within the smelter viability agreement such as the ability to use restricted cash to meet operating needs until competitive power is developed and provided under the signed PPAs. We are now focusing on making the partnership a success with the critical support from key stakeholders. Our last strategic update is related to our Australian mine approvals. We are currently progressing approvals along the time line shown for the next major Western Australian mine regions, Myara North and Holyoake through the WA EPA and Federal bilateral assessment process. It’s an extensive process that started in 2020, and we are focused on receiving ministerial approval by early 2026. We anticipate mining in the new regions will commence no earlier than 2027. Until then, we expect bauxite quality will remain similar to recent grades. The WA EPA recently said its indicative time line for the next key step in the process, the public comment period for early 2025. We are committed to working with the WA EPA and other stakeholders to achieve the indicative time line. Our Board has been and continues to engage with a range of stakeholders regarding our current and future operations. We have community engagement forms in place that provide an opportunity for two way discussion between Alcoa and host community members. This includes the recently established forum for the dwelling up community, which is near the future Holyoake mine region. As we plan for future operations, we are assessing what conditions may be applied of their approval process by examining our operations closely as well as by learning from the experience of our peers operating in the region. In 2023, we accepted and incorporated new conditions addressing key environmental factors that include enhanced protections for drinking water and increased mining distances from reservoirs, avoidance of key biodiversity areas and accelerating forest rehabilitation. By incorporating these conditions into our current operations, we believe they provide a strong foundation for what may be recommended in the assessment. Throughout all of these engagements, Alcoa's goal is to be recognized as a responsible miner and maintain the right to mine for long-term operations. We're focused on modernizing the approvals framework for bauxite mining in WA and securing certainty for our operations and all stakeholders. As a company, we are proud of the progress we made in the third quarter on multiple fronts. Looking ahead, we will maintain a fast pace of execution on strategic initiatives, improved productivity and stability across our operations and capitalize on positive market fundamentals to deliver value to our stockholders is shaping up to be an action-packed year. Operator, let's start the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTimna Tanners: Yes. Thank you and congrats on all the progress.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Timna.\nTimna Tanners: So many questions. Thanks. I guess I'll just ask about Spain. So just trying to understand, have you got approvals or initial response from either the union or the government? And assumedly, would you ramp up production to optimize profitability? What do they bring to the table? What's your level of profitability at spot?\nWilliam Oplinger: Yeah. Let me just address a few of those. What the partnership, first of all, we're trying to achieve a partnership. We haven't finalized the partnership yet, but our efforts on achieving the partnership are meant to bring IGNIS’ knowledge and expertise in the energy markets, combined with our knowledge and expertise around aluminum. And so around your question, specifically, if have we talked to the stakeholders, the reason for the announcement today is to launch that discussion with the stakeholders and to make sure that they understand that we need cooperations and make the site viable. We specifically in the announcement, talked about a number of things, CO2 compensation, permitting of power projects, the access to some of the restricted cash, that will allow us to chart a path forward that makes that plant viable. But it's conditional, the partnership is conditional on getting those -- that cooperation. And so that's what we'll be working on over the next couple of months.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. So I know I asked a lot of questions, but I just -- I guess it would be helpful to get a flavor on your confidence maybe or on their approval and what the plan B might be, I suppose, if you don't achieve those? And if you could comment on the plans to run that more full utilization, that would be great, too? Thanks.\nWilliam Oplinger: Yeah. And if I step back and just address how we got here, we were going down a dual path process where we were trying to sell the asset and at the same time, trying to make it a viable asset. We went out to 60 potential buyers for the asset, and there was not a viable offer for the entirety of the asset. In that process, IGNIS emerged as a potential partner for us to essentially combine their expertise and our expertise. In the partnership, they will be making a EUR25 million contribution to the site, they will end up owning 25% of the site, and we would hope to be able to work with the stakeholders so that we can get the support that we need. As far as my confidence, we're confident. We have made it this far. We had very good interaction with IGNIS, and we’re confident that we can get that – the partnership. Now the question will be sitting down and making sure that the stakeholders understand the need for the support that we’re looking for to ensure the solvency and the viability of the site.\nTimna Tanners: Thanks.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you, Timna.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChristopher LaFemina: Hey, thanks, operator. Just a follow-up question on the San Ciprian situation. So if my understanding is correct, you're committing up to EUR175 million of additional investment in the business. But is this sort of like it was before, where that's the limit as to how far you'll go or is it possible that you will fund significantly more than that? And I guess what I'm really getting at is what is the endgame? I mean, obviously, if it's a viable asset, well, then it could have a place within Alcoa. But what if we go back to kind of lower price environment, how does that play out for you? What are the options there?\nWilliam Oplinger: The end game here is to try to make it a viable asset. And the only way we get to that end game is that we have support from the unions and the government when you consider that EUR175 million that Alcoa would be putting in, we will be looking for government support of the CO2 compensation of approximately $80 million. In addition to that, there is a restricted cash in the site, which is about $85 million, and we'd be looking to access that to fund the operations. So that's at least two of the things we need to get in order to get the survivable operation. As we look forward, things can change in Europe. Clearly, you've got CBAM (ph) coming in. Energy markets are changing fairly quickly. So what we would be looking to do is to try to get that support in order to make those investments and have a site that's viable. Anything you want to add, Molly?\nMolly Beerman: Just on the $80 million of the CO2 compensation, that actually relates to the past. We did not receive our compensation for 2018 through 2021 when we were running the smelter. And so we've had claims against the government. We'd like to have those listed and have access to that $80 million since we ran and paid all of the employees.\nWilliam Oplinger: And just to make it clear to tie it all together, the $175 million, we would be using the $80 million, in the $85 million towards that contribution of $175 million.\nChristopher LaFemina: That's helpful. Thank you. And sorry, second, Molly, just on the profitability improvement program. Did you say that you're tracking ahead of some of the cost reductions there? And does that imply that, that $645 million target might ultimately be conservative or are we kind of sticking with that as being the most likely outcome?\nMolly Beerman: Chris, we are ahead on the raw materials, and that was a year-over-year target, so we're going to try to close off each piece of the program as we accomplish it. We are working very diligently now on setting a really aggressive 2025 plan. We recognize that any of these special programs take a lot of time and energy Alcoan’s are used to working toward an aggressive plan, have every bit of savings and productivity identified by person at delivery. So we will work on this program and close it off as we accomplish each piece. And then we're going to move forward into 2025 with a really aggressive budget.\nWilliam Oplinger: And if I could tag on to that comment, Molly. We're trying to change the culture so that our company folks across the entirety of the company, both within the plants and in our resource units are focused very highly on competitiveness. So you've heard us talk about advancing competitiveness and some of the targets that we've had, we're trying to make sure that this is not a one-off program that this becomes part of the culture where each plant, each resource unit is focused on increasing the overall competitiveness of the plant in comparison to plants around the world.\nChristopher LaFemina: Great. Thank you. Good luck. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you very much operator, and I want to add my congratulations on the progress across many fronts. I have one more question on San Ciprian. During the past that the power component was always a challenge there. And I wondered if you could maybe elaborate to what extent the potential partnership would alleviate that previous choke point? Thank you very much.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Lucas. That's a great question. And the reason why it's a great question is because power in Spain is still a problem. When you compare power in Spain versus Germany and France, Spain is fundamentally uncompetitive. And so that's where we need to ensure that we get the highest level of CO2 compensation available to us and any assistance we can get in areas like transmission costs. When you look at smelter in France, for instance, they get the maximum CO2 credit, they get the maximum assistance and transmission costs, which allows a smelter in France of all places to be competitive. We need the same type of thing in Spain. And as far as what IGNIS can help us with is really understanding underlying power markets trying to help us with some of those issues like CO2 compensation transmission costs and try to get us a competitive power situation, at least in the near term, while Europe works through some of the things like CBAM and the energy situation there.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you very much for that color. Very helpful. Bill, I'd like to ask you a bit about the alumina markets, obviously, very strong pricing dynamics, lots of disruptions around the world. And I wondered if you could maybe go through some of the discrete pressure points on the supply side and share your opinion on how quickly they might be resolved? And maybe also separate from that, where else you might see constraints on alumina medium term? Thank you very much.\nWilliam Oplinger: Yes. Alumina is acutely tight currently. I think on our chart, we showed something like $650, I think alumina prices reached close to $700 today, and there is very little liquidity in the market for shipping alumina currently. I'm sure that if I go through the list of disruptions, I'll probably miss one, so let me do it off the top of my head, we curtail the Kwinana facility earlier in the year. There was good strategic rationale for curtailing it with high cost, high complexity refinery, and we made that happen safely in the first half of the year. Subsequent to that, one of our competitors in Northern Australia had a pipeline issue. If you look at their numbers year-over-year, they are recovering from that, but are still not back at 100% capacity. One of our competitors in Jamaica had a storm roll through. They first said there was no impact, subsequently declared force majeure and so there was an impact there. I believe that's been largely remedy. And just this week, you probably heard some discussion probably saw a Bloomberg article about disruption around bauxite in Guinea. We don't know anything more about that than what you're reading in the press, but that puts further stress on the market. As we look forward to 2025, our view would have been that 2025 would come into balance at some point on alumina. However, in order to come into balance, a couple of things have to occur. Those disruptions need to be cleared up and not recur. And secondly, we’re going to need to see growth in Indonesia and India. And I guess speaking of India, that was the one I missed. You probably all saw at one of the competitors, a runoff water storage pond that collapse that may have had an impact on their production. So in order for the aluminum market to come back in the balance, we would need to see growth in those areas, and our view is that alumina will stay tight through the first half of next year.\nLucas Pipes: Bill, I really appreciate all the color to you and the team continued. Best of luck.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Peterson: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and nice job on the quarterly execution. I want to come back to San Ciprian and just maybe a little bit finer point. So I guess where alumina is today, how does this inform your refinery restart? And I guess how does this tie in maybe potential with negotiations with the unions and local governments. I guess on the government side, what are you looking for? Is this about the commitments to the renewable projects, the competitive PPAs? Just any sort of color you can provide on those?\nWilliam Oplinger: So let me answer the second part first, and that will give me to forget the first part. The second part, essentially, what we're looking for, we laid out in the press release, and that is CO2 compensation, as Molly said for past production, that's about $80 million, and we are looking for a permit for the uplift of the RDA at San Ciprian. We need to uplift the RDA to 104 meters, and so we're looking to get that. On top of that, from the unions, we would like to be able to access the restricted cash, the cash that's there to fund the operating expenses as we go forward. Molly, that I'm missing.\nMolly Beerman: Just within the government discussions, we're also talking about the permits. We do not have all the development permits or I should say, our -- the suppliers under our PPAs don't have all the permits to develop.\nWilliam Oplinger: Yeah. Good point. And as far as our thinking around ramping up the refinery, we really need to get the permits to do that uplift to the 104 meters in San Ciprian. And we'll be tracking those permits as they come in. And then once we have that, we'll make the determination then on whether to increase production at San Ciprian.\nWilliam Peterson: Yeah. Thanks for that, Molly. And maybe the next one for Molly. On the outlined, I guess, $120 million in the remaining savings over the next, I guess, 12 months to 15 months, and it sounds like you're going to come up with a 2025 plan, but can you elaborate on where the remaining savings are coming from as well as the cadence of the savings through the balance of next year?\nMolly Beerman: So I mentioned that on raw materials were over -- already overachieved and we'll actually add a little bit more in the fourth quarter there. On our productivity and competitiveness program, we are through $45 million of actions, and that's to get the $100 million run rate, and that's by the end of the first quarter of '25. Warwick, we're going after 60. We've achieved about $45 million through the third quarter. We have zero on the IRA waiting that decision. And then on the Alumar smelter, we're through 60 of 75 and that will go into next year to get the rest of that. And then Kwinana is the one where we are, I think, operating probably a bit behind target. We've only captured $20 million of the 70 (ph). We're keeping the target. We will go after that, but that will come more towards the end of 2025.\nWilliam Peterson: Very helpful. Thank you, Molly.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good afternoon or evening, gentlemen and Molly.\nWilliam Oplinger: Hey, Mike.\nMichael Dudas: Hey, Bill. Back to the Alumina market, how do you see a balance on the supply side you talked about for '25, but what about demand? I would think it's near current prices and given where aluminum is, how do you see that for some of the higher cost smelters. Will there be some decisions on that front that could certainly change things a little bit and maybe even on the converse tighten aluminum market further?\nWilliam Oplinger: So as we're seeing demand today, demand actually has on the aluminum side, has been pretty strong. You've seen some restarts in Europe that continue to drive the demand. As far as whether alumina prices will drive demand cuts in aluminum, it can really only speak for us. And we would be looking at all of our smelters and try to determine whether they can continue to be profitable at these levels and how long those higher alumina costs will stick around. So we have a pretty regular cadence of review of the profitability of our marginal smelters, and we go through that on a regular basis, and we'll take action if need be.\nMichael Dudas: Understood. Appreciate that. Thanks, Bill.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKatja Jancic: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe starting on -- given the environment is very healthy right now, can you remind us how you're thinking about your capital allocation especially, potentially returning more to shareholders?\nMolly Beerman: Katja, our primary goal for early 2025 is to delever as well as to reposition some of our debt to the jurisdictions that need cash. Our adjusted net debt has gone a bit higher at $2.2 billion. We added about $385 million this quarter with the completion of the Alumina Limited acquisition, so that will be our priority as we approach early '25.\nWilliam Oplinger: Katja, if you look back over the last five years, I think one of the greatest ways for us to release equity value is to pay down debt. We're a bigger company today than we were a year ago. We're a more profitable company today than we were a year ago after the Alumina Limited transaction. But I still believe that bringing down our debt levels is the best way in the near term to release equity value.\nKatja Jancic: And what would be the level you're looking to reach or you would be comfortable at?\nMolly Beerman: We're looking at several options, Katja, but we're not ready to guide on that yet.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. And if I may, just one more. Given the strength in the alumina market and the fact that there seems to be some durability expected in the prices. Are there any opportunities where you could besides San Ciprian increased production or debottleneck on your side?\nWilliam Oplinger: Short answer is largely no. I mean we are working on debottlenecking in Brazil, but that's taking some time. We constantly look at opportunities to creep our sites and to try to generate additional tons, but really no large step outs that we could execute upon quickly to take advantage of the higher prices.\nKatja Jancic: Okay. Thank you.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from John Tumazos with Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you for taking my question.\nWilliam Oplinger: Hey, John.\nJohn Tumazos: Bill, I was playing with my Excel spreadsheet, and I plugged in $575 for the fourth quarter on Alumina price and a $10 lower unit cost and $625 million popped out for EBITDA for the Alumina segment, and if some like that happen, maybe the aluminum metal segment was to transfer pricing would fall towards $100 million. So is it in the ballpark that we might see $175 million gain in EBITDA in the fourth quarter, if the attorneys will let you answer that question?\nWilliam Oplinger: Hey, John. I'll take a swing at this and Molly is much better at this. But essentially, start with our third quarter, take our sensitivities and apply our sensitivities, put in your estimate a price that you think will last during the fourth quarter. And then we give guidance around the strength of the fourth quarter on some qualitative items. So what did we say qualitatively. We said aluminum will be better by about $30 million, $30 million in the fourth quarter. I'm really happy about that. I would like to see Alumina get even better in 2025. But it's a very good start. Aluminum is relatively flat on a fourth quarter to third quarter basis. And then I think Molly guided to a little bit of an impact of change in their company profit elimination, with the rapid run-up of prices that we're seeing. Sometimes our sensitivities don't always work perfectly. And then when we see that, we try to make sure that you can build it into your model. So once you've done all that, it spits out an EBITDA level, and we'll let you make a determination whether you think it's realistic or not. Thanks.\nJohn Tumazos: Bill, can I ask a second one?\nWilliam Oplinger: Sure.\nJohn Tumazos: And actually, a little bit tongue in cheek and a little bit serious, I've sat in 3 hour geology seminars about the Nubian Shield or the Red Sea Basin, where the Saudi Arabian Peninsula is considered a very hot area for gold and copper geology. Ivanhoe (ph) is exploring for copper, Barrick for gold there. Should we view the $950 million of Ma’aden equity and the majority of their profits are phosphate, a long-term play on the phosphate market, and gold and copper exploration in the Nubian Shield or do you think it's something that you might sell as soon as the holding period expires?\nWilliam Oplinger: That's a great question, John. And let me just take the opportunity to give you a little bit of background. We announced the transaction that we were selling the 25.1% for $1.1 billion. The consideration is $150 million cash and $950 million of Ma'aden stock, that stock will be locked up on a lockup period that's a three-year, four-year to five-year staggered lockup period. Since the time of that announcement was the run-up in the Ma’aden stock, that transaction goes from being worth $1.1 billion to over $1.3 billion. So, so far, we're pretty happy, but it's early days. We did that transaction for two reasons. One, we wanted to simplify the organizational structure. We did not think that the Street gave us much value for the ownership of the 25.1% and probably rightfully so. And then secondly, we wanted to be able to crystallize and highlight that value on something that you can see on your screen on a daily basis to see how we -- how much we own there. As far as whether we will see shares in years three, four and five, we'll make that determination then. In the meantime, we have a great relationship with Ma'aden. I personally have a great relationship with many folks in the Kingdom, and we're super supportive of them being successful on phosphate, copper, gold and aluminum.\nJohn Tumazos: Whenever your production for metal is reported going forward, should we add 228,000 tons for 2026 for the Spanish restart and then deduct 175,000 tons because you sold the Ma'aden piece.\nMolly Beerman: So John, I would wait until we get our partnership structure in place, and we'll be able to give more guidance on what the restart ramp-up will look like. In terms of Ma'aden, I have the offtake margin handy, but I don't have the volume of tons. So we have been taking offtake, and that will stop with the completion of the transaction, that is not a huge margin to us. It's about $6 million per quarter. But again, when we give our guidance in January on the 2025 shipments and production, we will adjust at that point to remove it.\nJohn Tumazos: Do you count it as production or not?\nMolly Beerman: Just shipments, I believe, yes, shipments.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you.\nWilliam Oplinger: Yeah. We don't count as production. We count on a shipments because we have an offtake with the joint venture that gets sold onwards. So it’s in our shipments number but not our production number.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you for your patience with all my questions.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, John. Good to hear from you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nCarlos De Alba: Yeah. Thank you very much, Bill and Molly. On San Ciprian, is there a new timetable or a timetable for you to complete the discussions with the government and the union in order for you to determine whether you go ahead with this agreement that you are trying to close. Just would like to get a little bit of sense of time as to how much longer can this negotiation take before you're ready to really turn the page or continue operating from Ciprian asset?\nWilliam Oplinger: Not a significant change to the timetable that we've lined out before. The entities will run out of cash, we believe somewhere around the end of the year, potentially that could go a little bit further into 2025, depending on what market conditions are. So we're essentially pushing as hard as we can, as quickly as we can to ensure that we get the right level of cooperation from the various stakeholders and get the partnership consummated.\nCarlos De Alba: Okay. And just if the companies run out of cash, at that point in time, you basically file for bankruptcy or stop close shop? Is that what will happen?\nWilliam Oplinger: We're really focused on trying to make sure that, that doesn't happen, Carlos. But essentially, the entity is technically insolvent at that point. And so some -- as we've said before, some hard decisions will have to be made. What we're trying to do is avoid that.\nCarlos De Alba: Okay. All right. Thanks. And just on CapEx, is the second quarter I think in a row that CapEx goes up or return-seeking CapEx increases. Any -- not huge amounts, but anyway, increases. Any details or any color as to how much incremental either volumes or EBITDA can we expect from this project, these additional projects?\nMolly Beerman: Yeah. Carlos, we don’t have those figures handy. I don’t think you’ll find it to be notable though from this current set. These are a series of smaller projects that we’re approving now.\nCarlos De Alba: All right. Okay. Thank you very much. All the best.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Lachlan Shaw with UBS. Please go ahead.\nLachlan Shaw: Good afternoon, Bill and Molly. Thanks for your time. Just one question from me. So just on WA and the mine approval process there. I'm just interested, I suppose, how you think about that whole process and the scenarios potentially ahead of you given the experience of your peer there and the conditional approvals that sort of came through for them. I mean how do you think about what that -- what those scenarios might look like in the context of the environmental authorities in Australia generally pushing for more stringent conditions. Thank you.\nWilliam Oplinger: So Lachlan, thanks for the question. We're continuing to advance the mine approvals for both Myara North and Holyoake that process started in 2020, and we're focused on receiving our approvals by early 2026. And we're anticipating that mining in the new regions will commence no earlier than 2027. Recently, the WA EPA set the time line for the next major step in the approval process, and that's the public comment period that will occur in the first quarter of 2025. At the same time, we continue to work on our annual approvals from the WA state government for our rolling five year mine plan. So we continue to make good progress. We're committed -- very committed to making sure that we work collaboratively, I can't say that, we're collaboratively with the WA EPA and the other stakeholders. So we think we're making really good progress there. As far as your question around our neighbors in WA South32, we have looked at some of their conditions, and we acknowledge that there are some similarities between the activities between the two companies. But we continue to work through the -- a review of their process. And we think that we will learn a lot through that process. And we think we're actually in pretty good shape. So I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that, Molly.\nMolly Beerman: I'd just add that, remember, last year, when we were going through the approvals process for our annual mine plan, we adopted a whole series of new mining requirements. So many of the conditions that you see being added to South32 now, we've already done that. So we did go through their whole list. We looked at them the majority we had either already built into our current mine plans or had them incorporated in our new mine plans and some of those that were different are simply because we're mining in different areas. Some of the other South32, it's important to recognize that some of their cost increases are related to their carbon management. We are running natural gas, so we do not face the same kind of cost challenges. The safeguard mechanism that will be running in Australia is based on the industry standard. And if you look at our Pinjarra refinery, for example, we’re already at the industry best. So we have a different cost profile there as well.\nLachlan Shaw: That’s great color. Thanks again\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks, Lachlan.\nOperator: And our next question is a follow-up from Timna Tanners of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Oplinger: Hi, Timna.\nTimna Tanners: Yeah. Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow up on the capital allocation line of questions because I know that Molly in the prepared remarks noted some ability to continue to pursue perhaps some value-add or additional projects. And just back of the envelope, higher alumina prices in these commodity prices obviously, paying down debt is great use of cash, I get it. But is there anything else you can elaborate on regard the opportunities if indeed you have greater cash and cash generation into next year?\nMolly Beerman: Timna, we will certainly look at excess cash, and we will put it through our capital allocation framework. So we will look at returns to shareholders. We'll look at other growth opportunities, and we'll also look at additional portfolio actions, but we will wait to see how the cash is coming in through the rest of this year and to early next year along with those delevering plans that I mentioned.\nWilliam Oplinger: And it’s important to remember that at the beginning of the year, we issued $750 million of debt. We also took on an additional roughly $350 million debt in the Alumina transaction. As I said earlier, we are a bigger company. We should be a better company. But in the near term, we think there’s a lot of value – equity value created by delevering.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thanks.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Oplinger for closing remarks.\nWilliam Oplinger: Thank you for joining our call. Molly and I look forward to sharing further progress when we speak again in January. That concludes our call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "fullTranscript": "Jürgen Junginger: Good morning, everybody. I’m pleased to welcome you to our conference call. Today's agenda cover’s our results for the First Quarter of 2024, together with the outlook for the year. I am again joined by our CEO, Jochen Klösges; and our CFO, Marc Hess. They will take you through our presentation, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Now I'm pleased to hand over to Jochen. Jochen, please, the floor is yours.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you very much Jurgen. I would also like to extend a warm welcome to our conference call today. My colleague Marc Hess and I will explain how Aareal Bank Group has performed in the first quarter of the current financial year. And, of course, we look forward to answering your questions. As always, I'd like to start with an overview. You see, Aareal Bank Group has enjoyed a very good start to the current financial year, posting strong results for the first quarter. Consolidated operating profit increased by 66% to €103 million, which is the highest quarterly result since the fourth quarter of 2018. And, in fact, at the operating level, it is Aareal Bank Group's best quarter since its IPO more than 20 years ago. We have achieved this even with a relatively high loss allowance, and it demonstrates just how much we have strengthened Aareal Bank's resilience over the last years. And you see an increased probability of the group. This is clearly demonstrated by return on equity of close to 9% post-tax and roughly 13% pre-tax. But first, let's take a look at the performance of the individual components of Aareal Bank Group. The Bank, which is our Structured Property Financing and Banking & Digital Solutions segments, are on the left-hand side of Slide 2. And our software subsidiary, Aareon, is on the right. The Bank contributed €92 million of operating profit with higher income than in last year's first quarter and with lower costs, offsetting the increased but planned allowance of credit losses. This shows that we are well able to cope with today's challenging markets. And as you will recall, we recognized a loss allowance of €193 million for the fourth quarter of ’23. This provision laid the foundation for restructuring non-performing loans this year. Our specific target was to reduce our portfolio of non-performing loans by around €0.5 billion during the first quarter of this year. And we have achieved this reduction without requiring any further profit or loss charges for this reduction. And in this year's first quarter, we have recognized a €56 million management overlay as part of the loss allowance. This is a conservative move and reflects the ongoing challenges in the US office markets we see. Our financial position continues to be strong with a solid CET1 ratio of 19.7% and comfortable liquidity ratios. Turning now to the right-hand side of the slide, Aareon is showing strong growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter amounted to €40 million. This is more than twice the figure for the same quarter of the previous year. The consolidated operating profit contribution also developed well, reaching a positive €11 million. Aareon remains on track. Revenue increased by 31% and the share of recurring revenues, an important key figure in the software business, has grown to 83%. You know, we have invested heavily in Aareon, including around €100 million last year alone. Investment has been focused on efficiency measures and Aareon's M&A activities. In addition, we have established a new joint venture between the Bank and Aareon. These steps are now paying off. I would now like to hand over to Marc Hess, who will cover the key financial indicators for the first quarter. Over to you, Marc.\nMarc Hess : Thank you. Thank you very much, Jochen, and good morning from my side as well. Welcome to you all. Let's turn to Page 3. As you can see here, we achieved strong earnings growth in the first quarter. Net interest income of €254 million significantly exceeded the same quarter of the previous year and remained at a high level. As expected, this was slightly down on the fourth quarter of 2023's peak, given the general trend in interest rate, but definitely in line with our expectations or even slightly better. Net commission income came up by 19%. The main driver here were the revenues of Aareon. Overall, the Bank's profit before loan loss provision rose to €178 million. We kept costs under control and, again, demonstrated our significantly increased operating resilience. Loan loss provisions remained relatively high, but within our plans, reflecting, as Jochen just said, the uncertainty in the US property market. However, this was offset by strong income and, thus, our operating profit was 66% ahead of the first quarter of last year at €103 million. And the RoE after tax went up from 6.4% to 8.7%. So, let me now explain the results in a little bit more detail, starting with net interest income. It rose by 14% compared to Q1 2023 and, for the Bank, the growth was even higher at 18%. This is due, on the one hand, to our larger interest-bearing portfolio and good margins on the new business, whilst, on the other hand, it also is due to continued optimization of our funding mix and the normalized interest rate environment, which includes our strong deposit base from the housing industry and increased retail deposits and their contribution. Aareon’s M&A activity and transition to external debt financing did reduce net interest income by a total of €8 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. However, overall, the group showed a strong increase, as I just said. As I mentioned as well, net commission income also rose strongly to €86 million, with the 19% increase mainly attributable to growth at Aareon. Let's now turn to the next page and look at admin expenses. Expenses were down by 26% compared to the first quarter of 2023 at €147 million. Aareon’s previous year's 2023 first quarter included investments amounting to €34 million for efficiency measures and M&A-related costs at Aareon in Q1 ’24. Numbers of €66 million in Aareon include €10 million from, in 2023 acquired companies. Hence, our investments are beginning to show positive effects. That means we are realizing some synergies here, as promised. For the Bank, expenses reflect a decrease of €23 million, mainly in bank levies. Other bank costs were stable. The Bank's cost income ratio, therefore, remained at an excellent level of 32% during the first quarter. Risk provision of €86 million includes €3 million, which comes through fair value P&L. As expected, the provision remained relatively high and, as Jochen has just explained, it includes a management overlay of €56 million. Adding this €56 million to the existing balance sheet overlay provision stock means that we have a total of €81 million set aside now. By adopting this approach, we are being conservative and recognizing current uncertainties, particularly those surrounding the U.S. office property market. I would now like to hand back to Jochen, who will talk you through the developments of our segments.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you, Marc. I'd like to start with Structural Property Financing on Slide 7. We took a selective approach to new business in the first quarter. The market continues to be challenging, and transaction volumes are generally low. Therefore, new business for the quarter totaled €0.9 billion, and that is slightly lower than in the first quarter of 2023. Average LTV ratios were at 45% for new business, and margins averaged more than 270 basis points, which was ahead of our plan for the year as a whole. However, this low LTV is definitely not representative for our full year new business planning. And we continue to finance offices in the first quarter, but only in Europe. There are good opportunities available in this market segment which we want to exploit, provided they meet our conservative risk standards. The next slide on Page 8 shows you our existing portfolio, which totaled €32.1 billion at the end of March. This was €1.4 billion higher than at the end of the first quarter of the last year, but below the level at the end of 2023. Despite this, we are maintaining our full year portfolio target of €33 billion to €34 billion. Our portfolio breakdown compared to the end of 2023 did not change much. We have a clear focus on properties in the major urban centers, and continue to be broadly diversified by regions and property types, as you can see from the two pie charts at the bottom of this slide. We are also continuing to provide targeted financing for buildings that are being renovated to enhance their energy efficiency. In doing so, we are supporting the green transformation. Our growing green loan portfolio has increased to €5.5 billion, and total lending volume classified as green now amounts to €9.5 billion, and this equates to 30% of our portfolio. To give you just one example, during the first quarter, we financed a hotel portfolio in Australia consisting of five properties for the Pro-Invest Group. This was our largest green loan to-date in the Asia-Pacific region. Now let's take a look at the key performance indicators for our credit portfolio on the next slide. These continue to be at good levels. The average LTV ratio for our overall portfolio is at 56% at the end of March, the same as the end of ’23. The yield on that is shown at the bottom of the slide. It has improved continuously since the pandemic, and has now reached a new high of 9.8%. The yield is particularly good for hotels, shopping centers, and logistic properties. And hotels are well booked, which is reflected in high cash flows, and the retail sector has recovered despite all the doomed prophecies of a decline in bricks-and-mortar retail. And we can definitely see a parallel between retail and the current debate over offices. The offices in our portfolio are in good locations and have high standards, including energy efficiency. They are, and will remain, attractive investments. Turning now to our portfolio of non-performing loans. As planned, we have reduced our NPLs by more than €500 million with US office property loans, by far the largest part of this number. There was only one new NPL in the first quarter, and that was, unsurprisingly, for a US office property. The US office market remains very challenging, but all the other markets and regions in our portfolio are performing well. Thanks to the successful reduction, our NPL portfolio has decreased to €1.1 billion. This equates to an NPE ratio of 2.9%, which is also a significant improvement. We will continue to work hard to keep this ratio sustainably at or below 3% in the future. And I would like to mention, as I said on the past calls, the bank does not have any exposures in Russia, China or the Middle East. And we are active here in Germany, only to a very limited extent, with Germany accounting for just 7% of our total loan portfolio. And we do not finance developments, but we finance refurbishments to foster green transitions. As I've already said, the US office market remains very challenging, and we are monitoring developments closely. We choose not to enter new US office loans in the first quarter, and therefore the performing US office portfolio is very similar to that at the end of ’23. You see that here on Page 11. Around 50% of the portfolio is in New York, and the rest is in other major US cities. It is concentrated on Class A properties in A markets. 84% of the performing portfolio has an LTV better than 60%, and only 2% has an LTV above 80%. Let's now turn to the Banking & Digital Solutions business line. You see deposits from our housing industry clients remain above our target level of around €13 billion, and averaged €13.9 billion in the first quarter. There was intensified competition for deposits, but we have our own well, which testifies to strong customer loyalty and our firm roots in the housing and energy industry. Normalized interest rate levels positively impacted the comparison with the first quarter of ’23, with net interest income up by 25% to €65 million. The segment's commission income also continued to grow and was up by 13%. However, net commission income was reduced by fees of €10 million to the payment transaction joint venture established with Aareon at the beginning of this year. These fees will now recur on a quarterly basis. This brings us to our software subsidiary Aareon on the next slide. It has made a strong start to the new year. Revenue grew by 31% to €108 million, and adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to €40 million, both compared to the first quarter of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 37%. Aareon is well on the way to achieving its ambitious revenue and profit targets for this year. As reported in February, we established a joint venture between Aareon and the Bank during the first quarter. The joint venture, named First Financial Software, provides the foundation for long-term cooperation between the Bank and Aareon, and is also strengthening both the banking and software business of the group. During the quarter, Aareon also added strategic partnerships with payment solution providers in the UK and the Netherlands, and a new product in Spain. In addition, Aareon acquired Blue-Mountain Group in January. Blue-Mountain is a Dutch provider of business intelligence solutions for housing associations, healthcare, and educational institutions. And most recently, at the beginning of May, Aareon acquired a majority stake in Stonal. Stonal is a leading data management platform for property owners and investors in Europe that includes AI functionality. I will now hand over again to Marc, who will look at our funding and capital, and will then explain our outlook to you. Over to you again, Marc.\nMarc Hess: Thank you, Jochen. As you all know, our funding activities continue to be broadly diversified. In this context, we are benefiting from the initiatives we have undertaken in recent years to attract new investors and to tap new sources of funding. This includes, for example, our cooperation with Raisin in the launch of our commercial paper program. One result of these initiatives is the significant expansion of our deposit-taking business, which now accounts for around 45% of our total funding. This is partly attributable to our successful cooperation with Raisin. Thus, retail term deposits have now crossed the €3 billion mark, and the upward trend continues. Important in this context is that around 95% of our retail deposits have a term of two years or more. We are also expanding geographically. Retail depositors initially only came from Germany, but further markets were added in the first quarter of this year. So the Netherlands have got off to a good start, and we are now also present in Austria. More countries are expected to follow this year. Expansion of the deposit-taking business has also helped us to become a lot less dependent on the capital markets, minimizing our needs to issue senior preferred funding investments. We issued one Benchmark Pfandbrief for €500 million in the first quarter, and we are currently planning two further Benchmark Pfandbrief and one Senior Non-Preferred in Benchmark format in 2024. Our liquidity ratios remain very solid. At the end of March, the NSFR was at 117%, and the LCR was at 192%. On the next slide, that's Page 16, we have provided more detail on our deposits. There are essentially three components, the largest of which is the housing industry deposits. These are in the BDS segment and arise from its 4,000 clients, which manage 9 million housing units. These deposits are deeply integrated into the financial transactions of the housing industry and tend to be very sticky. We had anticipated the decline in institutional deposits that followed the reform of the German deposit protection scheme at the beginning of 2023, as a result, institutional deposits almost halved in 2023. However, as the charts on this slide show, proactive introduction of retail deposits have more than compensated, with this source of funding continuing to grow, as I just mentioned. The next slide briefly focuses on our Pfandbrief funding. Pfandbrief remain the cornerstone of our capital market funding. As you are aware, mortgage cover pool stands at €16.6 billion, with assets well diversified by country and by asset type. The pool represents first-class mortgage loans and has an average LTV of 34.5%. Moody's AAA Pfandbrief rating relies on an overall collateralization ratio of 15.5% on a PB basis. Aareal is well ahead of this, with a ratio of 23.9% at the end of March, and we are, of course, committed to keep our AAA rating for the Pfandbrief. Turning to capital, we are once again able to increase our CET1 ratio, which stood at 19.7% at the end of this quarter, compared to 19.4% at the end of 2023. The ratio benefited from the addition of retained Q1 profits. Risk weighted assets were reduced by portfolio development, but this was offset by increased RWAs for operational risk. The Basel IV CET1 fully phased ratio rose to 13.6% from 13.4% at the end of last year. Our T1-Leverage ratio remained at a very good 6.6%, the same as at the end of 2023, and up from 6.0% at the end of 2022, well above the regulatory requirements and the European average. So, let's now turn to the outlook. This is unchanged. Within the Bank, we want to expand the loan portfolio moderately to between €33 billion to €34 billion by the end of the year. To reach this, we expect new business of €8 billion to €9 billion. We continue to expect a stable volume of client deposits of around €13 billion in the BDS deposits. Overall, the Bank aims to increase its operating profit to between €250 million and €300 million, and as you can see with the results of Q1, we are well on track here. We expect sales revenues at Aareon to increase significantly to between €440 million and €460 million. Adjusted EBITDA is also said to be up strongly to between €160 and €170 million. We expect Aareon to make a positive contribution of around €50 million to the group's consolidated operating profit. This means that Aareal Bank Group's operating profit is planned to increase to between €300 million and €350 million in 2024, more than doubling the previous year's figure. And with this positive outlook, let me turn back to Jochen for his concluding remarks.\nJochen Klösges: Thanks, Marc. So, let me sum up briefly. Firstly, you see the first quarter of 2024 has again shown that our strong income enables us to offset a higher loss allowance. This is testament to our operating resilience, which has increased significantly, and the return on equity after tax amounted to 8.7%. Secondly, as already announced, we significantly reduced non-performing loans during the quarter, and we did this without any further impact on the profit and loss accounts. This means that our NPE ratio was below 3% at the end of March. And thirdly, please allow me to say a few personal words here. Over the past three years or so, I have been able to lead Aareal Bank Group in a phase of profound change and great challenges. And in a few months, I will be leaving the company feeling good that we have mastered these challenges well and that we have laid the foundation for sustainable and a successful development of our group. I can really say Aareal Bank Group is in very good shape today. And now, Marc and I, we look forward to answer your questions. So, please?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Corinne Cunningham from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nCorinne Cunningham : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for the call. I've got three questions, if I may. First one, just on margins. It shows that margins on new business are a little bit weaker, but you're predicting overall volume growth. Can you set that into context for what you're kind of expecting for the year as a whole in terms of your NII trends? Do you expect it to continue to drift lower quarter on quarter, or do you think actually will stabilize quite soon? My second question was about provision coverage. If you could give us some guidance on overall cover for the non-performing loans and then specifically for the US and the German non-performing loans? And then lastly, a quick question on your AT1s, if you've got anything to say, I guess, on the prospect of refinancing here given the recovery. Obviously, bonds are doing very well today, but just in terms of your overall thoughts on possible AT1 refinancing. Thank you very much.\nMarc Hess : Yeah, thank you very much. I'm happy to take your questions. As you said, margins were a little bit weaker than last year, so we were at 274 basis points in the new business compared to 291 basis points. But I think last year that was really a peak, and we also stressed that for this year we are planning a lower range of 260 basis points to 270 basis points. I think that answered the second part of your question here. So with 274 basis points, we are not only bang in line, but even slightly above our targeted range for this year. With regards to net interest income, as I mentioned, we have seen the peak in Q3 and Q4 last year. I think this is the same story that many banks will tell you. So we are now a little bit weaker. Will this trend continue? Well, I would say slightly. Yes, I would say slightly. We are not seeing a deterioration of our net interest income. We are seeing a stabilization of the net interest income at around this level for the rest of the year. When it comes to coverage ratios, so the coverage ratios on our NPLs, in Q1 stood at 27.1%. So it was up versus Q4. When we are only looking at, and I think this would be your next question, at the US office NPLs, then we have about the same coverage ratio. It's 27.3%. As Jochen pointed out, we have been really successful in reducing 50% of the new NPLs in US office that we had to face last year, only in this Q1, without any additional risk provisioning. And I think this is a very good proof that our coverage ratios are sound and absolutely adequate. When it comes to the AT1, obviously you know that first quarter was a very difficult environment with very volatile spreads for AT1s, especially for commercial real estate financing companies like us. So now we are happy that this uncertainty is moving out and that the quotations of our AT1s are improving. Of course, we are structuring our capital efficiently and AT1 is one of these buckets that we will always need for an efficient capital allocation and structure. So we plan to hold AT1. Of course, if the markets improve even further, we will take this opportunity to issue new and replace the old. Otherwise, of course, as we have always said, we will take the decision every year and looking at the market conditions. So I hope this answers your questions.\nCorinne Cunningham : Thank you very much.\nMarc Hess : Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Alexey Reutov from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAlexey Reutov: Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. You mentioned the portfolio disposal in the US by €500 million. Could you please maybe provide more detail of this transaction as much as you can in terms of who is the buyer or type of buyer and also what was provisioning level for that portfolio and what type of loans, how many loans, any color would help?\nJochen Klösges : Thanks for your question. Let me try to answer the question. It was not in fact a portfolio disposal. It was basically the active management of our NPL portfolio in the United States. We explained and mentioned that already when we gave guidance about that during our annual press conference. What does it mean? Finally, we have a set of tools in place to handle these non-performing loans. It can be restructurings. It can be disposal of assets. It can be disposal of loans. And finally, we always use all these tools in phases like these. And we did that in the past, for example, during the pandemic. So we have a very experienced team in the US, a very experienced workout team here in Wiesbaden supporting the team in the US. And it's really a case-by-case management, not a disposal of a portfolio. And we're always trying to find the best solution which fits predominantly our interest but also takes into account possibilities on our client side. But it's a case-by-case management and we promise to do that in the first quarter in a significant amount of money. That means €500 million and we delivered that.\nAlexey Reutov: So, was it mainly restructuring, modification or did you sell any loans or any assets?\nJochen Klösges : It's really a mix of all these tools. We sold loans, assets have been sold, our clients found new lenders and we already also included some restructurings. You see that probably in the development of our performing loan, you see that on the chart here, it increased without doing any new business by roughly €100 million. This is because we had some restructurings which then led to shifts from the non-performing portfolio to the performing portfolio, for example.\nAlexey Reutov: And sales, what proportion of those €500 million was loan sales and can you discuss the percentage of provision in which you had against those loans?\nJochen Klösges : Yes, so I'm not in a position to elaborate on details because we're talking about single loans here. But again, you can see Marc reported that our coverage ratio at the US portfolio is in line with the coverage ratio of the whole portfolio. That shows you and additionally, his elaboration about the fact that we did not need to invest further money into the exit of these NPLs. They were decently provisioned by the year end ’23 that shows you that we basically are able to manage these portfolios and the exits at current market prices which then reflect our provisions.\nAlexey Reutov: Okay, this is very helpful. Thank you very much.\nJochen Klösges : Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ibrahim Syed from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nIbrahim Syed: Hi, morning. Thanks a lot for taking my call and well done on the results today. Just two questions for me, please. The first one is, are you able to share any sort of anecdotal evidence of how office building assets, DSO, not the loan, but the actual buildings, how that market is looking in Germany in particular, in particular on the more distressed end of the scale? Do you see that there is some movement because the evidence we've seen so far is that those assets really aren't trading and there's a pretty big difference between what buyers are asking and what sellers are willing to accept. And so if you have any updates on what that is looking like, do you see that directionally improving? Do you see some more liquidity there? And the second one, just to come back to the first question on the AT1, just to understand what you're saying is as the AT1 gets closer to par and within sort of reset levels, that starts to become economic or would you -- just a bit more sense on how you would assess the economics of that trade? Thank you.\nJochen Klösges : Okay. Thanks for your questions. I will cover the first one. The second one will be covered by Marc. So to be pretty honest, I'm not the biggest expert about the German office market, why? We have no NPLs in the German office market. And if I recall correctly, I guess the amount of loans we have in Germany in the performing area of the office as a class is roughly about, I guess, €200 million or something, really not significant part of our portfolio. What I can say is that we still see in Germany as well as in other markets in Europe comparably low transactions in the markets. This is caused by the still existing uncertainty in the markets. Did we see always the bottom of the cycle? I don't know exactly. I guess it will take a few more quarters finally to then see a situation where EBITDA spreads are then a bit tighter and more transactions can be seen. But again, as always, it depends on the specific properties. When you talk about Class A office properties in Germany, for example, in Munich, Frankfurt or Hamburg, there is no issue really to let these. These properties currently have decent rent levels. And so there are parts which are really still healthy. Others are a little bit more stressed. And I guess this status will be something where everybody being active in the market will have to cope with for a couple of quarters. But again, it's not our cup of tea because we have close to zero business or roughly only €20 million of office buildings in Germany. And these loans are performing. Second question may be answered by Marc.\nMarc Hess: Ibrahim, thanks for your question on the AT1. Again, as I said, it will be an economic decision. So obviously, the aim is to issue it similar or hopefully even lower spreads and the current issuance. And well, so far, we were a little bit unlucky here. We remember this year, well, we had this turmoil in the market. Last year, at our call date, we had to Credit Suisse, the year before Russia invaded the Ukraine and the year before, we had COVID coming up. So always exactly during that phase where we are able to call the bond. So, well, hopefully, next spring, we are in a better position and we will take a decision then on the basis that I just outlined.\nIbrahim Syed: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jochen Klösges for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you. So yeah, thank you, everybody, for your questions. And, as you know, the next quarterly figures in August are expected to be presented by my successor, Dr Christian Ricken, together with Marc. And I would like to take this opportunity today to thank everyone for their critical and trusting support in the last three years. I have really always enjoyed talking to you very much. And I'm grateful for the suggestions that I took away from our discussions. Yeah, best wishes to everybody and hope to see you again soon. Thank you very much.",

      "transcript": "Jürgen Junginger: Good morning, everybody. I’m pleased to welcome you to our conference call. Today's agenda cover’s our results for the First Quarter of 2024, together with the outlook for the year. I am again joined by our CEO, Jochen Klösges; and our CFO, Marc Hess. They will take you through our presentation, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session. Now I'm pleased to hand over to Jochen. Jochen, please, the floor is yours.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you very much Jurgen. I would also like to extend a warm welcome to our conference call today. My colleague Marc Hess and I will explain how Aareal Bank Group has performed in the first quarter of the current financial year. And, of course, we look forward to answering your questions. As always, I'd like to start with an overview. You see, Aareal Bank Group has enjoyed a very good start to the current financial year, posting strong results for the first quarter. Consolidated operating profit increased by 66% to €103 million, which is the highest quarterly result since the fourth quarter of 2018. And, in fact, at the operating level, it is Aareal Bank Group's best quarter since its IPO more than 20 years ago. We have achieved this even with a relatively high loss allowance, and it demonstrates just how much we have strengthened Aareal Bank's resilience over the last years. And you see an increased probability of the group. This is clearly demonstrated by return on equity of close to 9% post-tax and roughly 13% pre-tax. But first, let's take a look at the performance of the individual components of Aareal Bank Group. The Bank, which is our Structured Property Financing and Banking & Digital Solutions segments, are on the left-hand side of Slide 2. And our software subsidiary, Aareon, is on the right. The Bank contributed €92 million of operating profit with higher income than in last year's first quarter and with lower costs, offsetting the increased but planned allowance of credit losses. This shows that we are well able to cope with today's challenging markets. And as you will recall, we recognized a loss allowance of €193 million for the fourth quarter of ’23. This provision laid the foundation for restructuring non-performing loans this year. Our specific target was to reduce our portfolio of non-performing loans by around €0.5 billion during the first quarter of this year. And we have achieved this reduction without requiring any further profit or loss charges for this reduction. And in this year's first quarter, we have recognized a €56 million management overlay as part of the loss allowance. This is a conservative move and reflects the ongoing challenges in the US office markets we see. Our financial position continues to be strong with a solid CET1 ratio of 19.7% and comfortable liquidity ratios. Turning now to the right-hand side of the slide, Aareon is showing strong growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter amounted to €40 million. This is more than twice the figure for the same quarter of the previous year. The consolidated operating profit contribution also developed well, reaching a positive €11 million. Aareon remains on track. Revenue increased by 31% and the share of recurring revenues, an important key figure in the software business, has grown to 83%. You know, we have invested heavily in Aareon, including around €100 million last year alone. Investment has been focused on efficiency measures and Aareon's M&A activities. In addition, we have established a new joint venture between the Bank and Aareon. These steps are now paying off. I would now like to hand over to Marc Hess, who will cover the key financial indicators for the first quarter. Over to you, Marc.\nMarc Hess : Thank you. Thank you very much, Jochen, and good morning from my side as well. Welcome to you all. Let's turn to Page 3. As you can see here, we achieved strong earnings growth in the first quarter. Net interest income of €254 million significantly exceeded the same quarter of the previous year and remained at a high level. As expected, this was slightly down on the fourth quarter of 2023's peak, given the general trend in interest rate, but definitely in line with our expectations or even slightly better. Net commission income came up by 19%. The main driver here were the revenues of Aareon. Overall, the Bank's profit before loan loss provision rose to €178 million. We kept costs under control and, again, demonstrated our significantly increased operating resilience. Loan loss provisions remained relatively high, but within our plans, reflecting, as Jochen just said, the uncertainty in the US property market. However, this was offset by strong income and, thus, our operating profit was 66% ahead of the first quarter of last year at €103 million. And the RoE after tax went up from 6.4% to 8.7%. So, let me now explain the results in a little bit more detail, starting with net interest income. It rose by 14% compared to Q1 2023 and, for the Bank, the growth was even higher at 18%. This is due, on the one hand, to our larger interest-bearing portfolio and good margins on the new business, whilst, on the other hand, it also is due to continued optimization of our funding mix and the normalized interest rate environment, which includes our strong deposit base from the housing industry and increased retail deposits and their contribution. Aareon’s M&A activity and transition to external debt financing did reduce net interest income by a total of €8 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. However, overall, the group showed a strong increase, as I just said. As I mentioned as well, net commission income also rose strongly to €86 million, with the 19% increase mainly attributable to growth at Aareon. Let's now turn to the next page and look at admin expenses. Expenses were down by 26% compared to the first quarter of 2023 at €147 million. Aareon’s previous year's 2023 first quarter included investments amounting to €34 million for efficiency measures and M&A-related costs at Aareon in Q1 ’24. Numbers of €66 million in Aareon include €10 million from, in 2023 acquired companies. Hence, our investments are beginning to show positive effects. That means we are realizing some synergies here, as promised. For the Bank, expenses reflect a decrease of €23 million, mainly in bank levies. Other bank costs were stable. The Bank's cost income ratio, therefore, remained at an excellent level of 32% during the first quarter. Risk provision of €86 million includes €3 million, which comes through fair value P&L. As expected, the provision remained relatively high and, as Jochen has just explained, it includes a management overlay of €56 million. Adding this €56 million to the existing balance sheet overlay provision stock means that we have a total of €81 million set aside now. By adopting this approach, we are being conservative and recognizing current uncertainties, particularly those surrounding the U.S. office property market. I would now like to hand back to Jochen, who will talk you through the developments of our segments.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you, Marc. I'd like to start with Structural Property Financing on Slide 7. We took a selective approach to new business in the first quarter. The market continues to be challenging, and transaction volumes are generally low. Therefore, new business for the quarter totaled €0.9 billion, and that is slightly lower than in the first quarter of 2023. Average LTV ratios were at 45% for new business, and margins averaged more than 270 basis points, which was ahead of our plan for the year as a whole. However, this low LTV is definitely not representative for our full year new business planning. And we continue to finance offices in the first quarter, but only in Europe. There are good opportunities available in this market segment which we want to exploit, provided they meet our conservative risk standards. The next slide on Page 8 shows you our existing portfolio, which totaled €32.1 billion at the end of March. This was €1.4 billion higher than at the end of the first quarter of the last year, but below the level at the end of 2023. Despite this, we are maintaining our full year portfolio target of €33 billion to €34 billion. Our portfolio breakdown compared to the end of 2023 did not change much. We have a clear focus on properties in the major urban centers, and continue to be broadly diversified by regions and property types, as you can see from the two pie charts at the bottom of this slide. We are also continuing to provide targeted financing for buildings that are being renovated to enhance their energy efficiency. In doing so, we are supporting the green transformation. Our growing green loan portfolio has increased to €5.5 billion, and total lending volume classified as green now amounts to €9.5 billion, and this equates to 30% of our portfolio. To give you just one example, during the first quarter, we financed a hotel portfolio in Australia consisting of five properties for the Pro-Invest Group. This was our largest green loan to-date in the Asia-Pacific region. Now let's take a look at the key performance indicators for our credit portfolio on the next slide. These continue to be at good levels. The average LTV ratio for our overall portfolio is at 56% at the end of March, the same as the end of ’23. The yield on that is shown at the bottom of the slide. It has improved continuously since the pandemic, and has now reached a new high of 9.8%. The yield is particularly good for hotels, shopping centers, and logistic properties. And hotels are well booked, which is reflected in high cash flows, and the retail sector has recovered despite all the doomed prophecies of a decline in bricks-and-mortar retail. And we can definitely see a parallel between retail and the current debate over offices. The offices in our portfolio are in good locations and have high standards, including energy efficiency. They are, and will remain, attractive investments. Turning now to our portfolio of non-performing loans. As planned, we have reduced our NPLs by more than €500 million with US office property loans, by far the largest part of this number. There was only one new NPL in the first quarter, and that was, unsurprisingly, for a US office property. The US office market remains very challenging, but all the other markets and regions in our portfolio are performing well. Thanks to the successful reduction, our NPL portfolio has decreased to €1.1 billion. This equates to an NPE ratio of 2.9%, which is also a significant improvement. We will continue to work hard to keep this ratio sustainably at or below 3% in the future. And I would like to mention, as I said on the past calls, the bank does not have any exposures in Russia, China or the Middle East. And we are active here in Germany, only to a very limited extent, with Germany accounting for just 7% of our total loan portfolio. And we do not finance developments, but we finance refurbishments to foster green transitions. As I've already said, the US office market remains very challenging, and we are monitoring developments closely. We choose not to enter new US office loans in the first quarter, and therefore the performing US office portfolio is very similar to that at the end of ’23. You see that here on Page 11. Around 50% of the portfolio is in New York, and the rest is in other major US cities. It is concentrated on Class A properties in A markets. 84% of the performing portfolio has an LTV better than 60%, and only 2% has an LTV above 80%. Let's now turn to the Banking & Digital Solutions business line. You see deposits from our housing industry clients remain above our target level of around €13 billion, and averaged €13.9 billion in the first quarter. There was intensified competition for deposits, but we have our own well, which testifies to strong customer loyalty and our firm roots in the housing and energy industry. Normalized interest rate levels positively impacted the comparison with the first quarter of ’23, with net interest income up by 25% to €65 million. The segment's commission income also continued to grow and was up by 13%. However, net commission income was reduced by fees of €10 million to the payment transaction joint venture established with Aareon at the beginning of this year. These fees will now recur on a quarterly basis. This brings us to our software subsidiary Aareon on the next slide. It has made a strong start to the new year. Revenue grew by 31% to €108 million, and adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to €40 million, both compared to the first quarter of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 37%. Aareon is well on the way to achieving its ambitious revenue and profit targets for this year. As reported in February, we established a joint venture between Aareon and the Bank during the first quarter. The joint venture, named First Financial Software, provides the foundation for long-term cooperation between the Bank and Aareon, and is also strengthening both the banking and software business of the group. During the quarter, Aareon also added strategic partnerships with payment solution providers in the UK and the Netherlands, and a new product in Spain. In addition, Aareon acquired Blue-Mountain Group in January. Blue-Mountain is a Dutch provider of business intelligence solutions for housing associations, healthcare, and educational institutions. And most recently, at the beginning of May, Aareon acquired a majority stake in Stonal. Stonal is a leading data management platform for property owners and investors in Europe that includes AI functionality. I will now hand over again to Marc, who will look at our funding and capital, and will then explain our outlook to you. Over to you again, Marc.\nMarc Hess: Thank you, Jochen. As you all know, our funding activities continue to be broadly diversified. In this context, we are benefiting from the initiatives we have undertaken in recent years to attract new investors and to tap new sources of funding. This includes, for example, our cooperation with Raisin in the launch of our commercial paper program. One result of these initiatives is the significant expansion of our deposit-taking business, which now accounts for around 45% of our total funding. This is partly attributable to our successful cooperation with Raisin. Thus, retail term deposits have now crossed the €3 billion mark, and the upward trend continues. Important in this context is that around 95% of our retail deposits have a term of two years or more. We are also expanding geographically. Retail depositors initially only came from Germany, but further markets were added in the first quarter of this year. So the Netherlands have got off to a good start, and we are now also present in Austria. More countries are expected to follow this year. Expansion of the deposit-taking business has also helped us to become a lot less dependent on the capital markets, minimizing our needs to issue senior preferred funding investments. We issued one Benchmark Pfandbrief for €500 million in the first quarter, and we are currently planning two further Benchmark Pfandbrief and one Senior Non-Preferred in Benchmark format in 2024. Our liquidity ratios remain very solid. At the end of March, the NSFR was at 117%, and the LCR was at 192%. On the next slide, that's Page 16, we have provided more detail on our deposits. There are essentially three components, the largest of which is the housing industry deposits. These are in the BDS segment and arise from its 4,000 clients, which manage 9 million housing units. These deposits are deeply integrated into the financial transactions of the housing industry and tend to be very sticky. We had anticipated the decline in institutional deposits that followed the reform of the German deposit protection scheme at the beginning of 2023, as a result, institutional deposits almost halved in 2023. However, as the charts on this slide show, proactive introduction of retail deposits have more than compensated, with this source of funding continuing to grow, as I just mentioned. The next slide briefly focuses on our Pfandbrief funding. Pfandbrief remain the cornerstone of our capital market funding. As you are aware, mortgage cover pool stands at €16.6 billion, with assets well diversified by country and by asset type. The pool represents first-class mortgage loans and has an average LTV of 34.5%. Moody's AAA Pfandbrief rating relies on an overall collateralization ratio of 15.5% on a PB basis. Aareal is well ahead of this, with a ratio of 23.9% at the end of March, and we are, of course, committed to keep our AAA rating for the Pfandbrief. Turning to capital, we are once again able to increase our CET1 ratio, which stood at 19.7% at the end of this quarter, compared to 19.4% at the end of 2023. The ratio benefited from the addition of retained Q1 profits. Risk weighted assets were reduced by portfolio development, but this was offset by increased RWAs for operational risk. The Basel IV CET1 fully phased ratio rose to 13.6% from 13.4% at the end of last year. Our T1-Leverage ratio remained at a very good 6.6%, the same as at the end of 2023, and up from 6.0% at the end of 2022, well above the regulatory requirements and the European average. So, let's now turn to the outlook. This is unchanged. Within the Bank, we want to expand the loan portfolio moderately to between €33 billion to €34 billion by the end of the year. To reach this, we expect new business of €8 billion to €9 billion. We continue to expect a stable volume of client deposits of around €13 billion in the BDS deposits. Overall, the Bank aims to increase its operating profit to between €250 million and €300 million, and as you can see with the results of Q1, we are well on track here. We expect sales revenues at Aareon to increase significantly to between €440 million and €460 million. Adjusted EBITDA is also said to be up strongly to between €160 and €170 million. We expect Aareon to make a positive contribution of around €50 million to the group's consolidated operating profit. This means that Aareal Bank Group's operating profit is planned to increase to between €300 million and €350 million in 2024, more than doubling the previous year's figure. And with this positive outlook, let me turn back to Jochen for his concluding remarks.\nJochen Klösges: Thanks, Marc. So, let me sum up briefly. Firstly, you see the first quarter of 2024 has again shown that our strong income enables us to offset a higher loss allowance. This is testament to our operating resilience, which has increased significantly, and the return on equity after tax amounted to 8.7%. Secondly, as already announced, we significantly reduced non-performing loans during the quarter, and we did this without any further impact on the profit and loss accounts. This means that our NPE ratio was below 3% at the end of March. And thirdly, please allow me to say a few personal words here. Over the past three years or so, I have been able to lead Aareal Bank Group in a phase of profound change and great challenges. And in a few months, I will be leaving the company feeling good that we have mastered these challenges well and that we have laid the foundation for sustainable and a successful development of our group. I can really say Aareal Bank Group is in very good shape today. And now, Marc and I, we look forward to answer your questions. So, please?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Corinne Cunningham from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nCorinne Cunningham : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for the call. I've got three questions, if I may. First one, just on margins. It shows that margins on new business are a little bit weaker, but you're predicting overall volume growth. Can you set that into context for what you're kind of expecting for the year as a whole in terms of your NII trends? Do you expect it to continue to drift lower quarter on quarter, or do you think actually will stabilize quite soon? My second question was about provision coverage. If you could give us some guidance on overall cover for the non-performing loans and then specifically for the US and the German non-performing loans? And then lastly, a quick question on your AT1s, if you've got anything to say, I guess, on the prospect of refinancing here given the recovery. Obviously, bonds are doing very well today, but just in terms of your overall thoughts on possible AT1 refinancing. Thank you very much.\nMarc Hess : Yeah, thank you very much. I'm happy to take your questions. As you said, margins were a little bit weaker than last year, so we were at 274 basis points in the new business compared to 291 basis points. But I think last year that was really a peak, and we also stressed that for this year we are planning a lower range of 260 basis points to 270 basis points. I think that answered the second part of your question here. So with 274 basis points, we are not only bang in line, but even slightly above our targeted range for this year. With regards to net interest income, as I mentioned, we have seen the peak in Q3 and Q4 last year. I think this is the same story that many banks will tell you. So we are now a little bit weaker. Will this trend continue? Well, I would say slightly. Yes, I would say slightly. We are not seeing a deterioration of our net interest income. We are seeing a stabilization of the net interest income at around this level for the rest of the year. When it comes to coverage ratios, so the coverage ratios on our NPLs, in Q1 stood at 27.1%. So it was up versus Q4. When we are only looking at, and I think this would be your next question, at the US office NPLs, then we have about the same coverage ratio. It's 27.3%. As Jochen pointed out, we have been really successful in reducing 50% of the new NPLs in US office that we had to face last year, only in this Q1, without any additional risk provisioning. And I think this is a very good proof that our coverage ratios are sound and absolutely adequate. When it comes to the AT1, obviously you know that first quarter was a very difficult environment with very volatile spreads for AT1s, especially for commercial real estate financing companies like us. So now we are happy that this uncertainty is moving out and that the quotations of our AT1s are improving. Of course, we are structuring our capital efficiently and AT1 is one of these buckets that we will always need for an efficient capital allocation and structure. So we plan to hold AT1. Of course, if the markets improve even further, we will take this opportunity to issue new and replace the old. Otherwise, of course, as we have always said, we will take the decision every year and looking at the market conditions. So I hope this answers your questions.\nCorinne Cunningham : Thank you very much.\nMarc Hess : Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Alexey Reutov from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAlexey Reutov: Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. You mentioned the portfolio disposal in the US by €500 million. Could you please maybe provide more detail of this transaction as much as you can in terms of who is the buyer or type of buyer and also what was provisioning level for that portfolio and what type of loans, how many loans, any color would help?\nJochen Klösges : Thanks for your question. Let me try to answer the question. It was not in fact a portfolio disposal. It was basically the active management of our NPL portfolio in the United States. We explained and mentioned that already when we gave guidance about that during our annual press conference. What does it mean? Finally, we have a set of tools in place to handle these non-performing loans. It can be restructurings. It can be disposal of assets. It can be disposal of loans. And finally, we always use all these tools in phases like these. And we did that in the past, for example, during the pandemic. So we have a very experienced team in the US, a very experienced workout team here in Wiesbaden supporting the team in the US. And it's really a case-by-case management, not a disposal of a portfolio. And we're always trying to find the best solution which fits predominantly our interest but also takes into account possibilities on our client side. But it's a case-by-case management and we promise to do that in the first quarter in a significant amount of money. That means €500 million and we delivered that.\nAlexey Reutov: So, was it mainly restructuring, modification or did you sell any loans or any assets?\nJochen Klösges : It's really a mix of all these tools. We sold loans, assets have been sold, our clients found new lenders and we already also included some restructurings. You see that probably in the development of our performing loan, you see that on the chart here, it increased without doing any new business by roughly €100 million. This is because we had some restructurings which then led to shifts from the non-performing portfolio to the performing portfolio, for example.\nAlexey Reutov: And sales, what proportion of those €500 million was loan sales and can you discuss the percentage of provision in which you had against those loans?\nJochen Klösges : Yes, so I'm not in a position to elaborate on details because we're talking about single loans here. But again, you can see Marc reported that our coverage ratio at the US portfolio is in line with the coverage ratio of the whole portfolio. That shows you and additionally, his elaboration about the fact that we did not need to invest further money into the exit of these NPLs. They were decently provisioned by the year end ’23 that shows you that we basically are able to manage these portfolios and the exits at current market prices which then reflect our provisions.\nAlexey Reutov: Okay, this is very helpful. Thank you very much.\nJochen Klösges : Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ibrahim Syed from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nIbrahim Syed: Hi, morning. Thanks a lot for taking my call and well done on the results today. Just two questions for me, please. The first one is, are you able to share any sort of anecdotal evidence of how office building assets, DSO, not the loan, but the actual buildings, how that market is looking in Germany in particular, in particular on the more distressed end of the scale? Do you see that there is some movement because the evidence we've seen so far is that those assets really aren't trading and there's a pretty big difference between what buyers are asking and what sellers are willing to accept. And so if you have any updates on what that is looking like, do you see that directionally improving? Do you see some more liquidity there? And the second one, just to come back to the first question on the AT1, just to understand what you're saying is as the AT1 gets closer to par and within sort of reset levels, that starts to become economic or would you -- just a bit more sense on how you would assess the economics of that trade? Thank you.\nJochen Klösges : Okay. Thanks for your questions. I will cover the first one. The second one will be covered by Marc. So to be pretty honest, I'm not the biggest expert about the German office market, why? We have no NPLs in the German office market. And if I recall correctly, I guess the amount of loans we have in Germany in the performing area of the office as a class is roughly about, I guess, €200 million or something, really not significant part of our portfolio. What I can say is that we still see in Germany as well as in other markets in Europe comparably low transactions in the markets. This is caused by the still existing uncertainty in the markets. Did we see always the bottom of the cycle? I don't know exactly. I guess it will take a few more quarters finally to then see a situation where EBITDA spreads are then a bit tighter and more transactions can be seen. But again, as always, it depends on the specific properties. When you talk about Class A office properties in Germany, for example, in Munich, Frankfurt or Hamburg, there is no issue really to let these. These properties currently have decent rent levels. And so there are parts which are really still healthy. Others are a little bit more stressed. And I guess this status will be something where everybody being active in the market will have to cope with for a couple of quarters. But again, it's not our cup of tea because we have close to zero business or roughly only €20 million of office buildings in Germany. And these loans are performing. Second question may be answered by Marc.\nMarc Hess: Ibrahim, thanks for your question on the AT1. Again, as I said, it will be an economic decision. So obviously, the aim is to issue it similar or hopefully even lower spreads and the current issuance. And well, so far, we were a little bit unlucky here. We remember this year, well, we had this turmoil in the market. Last year, at our call date, we had to Credit Suisse, the year before Russia invaded the Ukraine and the year before, we had COVID coming up. So always exactly during that phase where we are able to call the bond. So, well, hopefully, next spring, we are in a better position and we will take a decision then on the basis that I just outlined.\nIbrahim Syed: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jochen Klösges for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you. So yeah, thank you, everybody, for your questions. And, as you know, the next quarterly figures in August are expected to be presented by my successor, Dr Christian Ricken, together with Marc. And I would like to take this opportunity today to thank everyone for their critical and trusting support in the last three years. I have really always enjoyed talking to you very much. And I'm grateful for the suggestions that I took away from our discussions. Yeah, best wishes to everybody and hope to see you again soon. Thank you very much.",

    "fullTranscript": "Jürgen Junginger: Good morning, everybody and thank you for joining our conference call. Today's agenda will cover the results, the prelim results for 2023 and the outlook for 2024. I'm joined by our CEO, Jochen Klösges; and our CFO, Marc Hess. They will take you through the presentation, which will be followed by a Q&A session. Now I'm pleased to hand over to Jochen. Jochen, the floor is yours.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you very much Jürgen. Good morning, and welcome. Today, we will of course be talking about our company, about figures, markets and trends. And we will certainly also be talking about US property markets in detail, which are currently once again in focus. Now let me first take a look at the political and economic environment in which we operate. 2023 was a difficult year. We have all learned that nothing is certain anymore and nothing can be taken for granted. Neither peace nor freedom are guaranteed. And – so we continue to find ourselves affected by the deep suffering that war has brought upon the Ukrainian people. And in addition last year another war erupted in the Middle East, which shocked us deeply and made the global political situation even more uncertain. All of this affects us during a period, which is challenging from an economic point of view as well. That also applies to the commercial property market, which brings me to our business. There's no doubt that 2023 was a challenging year, especially regarding the performance of the US office property market. You know us, we are used to dealing with these adverse conditions and we have succeeded before in difficult markets. In times like these, it is not German angst, but German's preservance that is needed. We proved this throughout the Corona virus pandemic, when nobody believed in hotels anymore. We carried around €10 billion of hotel exposure through the crisis. And it is these hotels that are helping us now through the cycle because they are contributing to our strong earnings power. The US office property markets have turned down over the last year. Why is that? A combination of working from home, soaring interest rates, and excess capacity, which already existed beforehand, explains this development. We are assuming that the US office markets will continue – continue to experience change for quite some time. However, in the fourth quarter of last year, the markets turned out to be even more challenging than anticipated. As a result, we recognized a loss allowance of some €190 million in the fourth quarter. This will enable us to reduce our NPL portfolio by around €0.5 billion in the first quarter of this year. As I already pointed out in the past, we have been dealing with the challenges and burdens resulting from a downturn in the US office property, since the spring of 2023. We have been working with our clients and partners on resolving every individual case, restructuring exposures and recognizing loss allowances, where appropriate. As we reach the end of this cyclical downturn, will the markets turn around quickly now? Frankly, it doesn't look like it yet. While we have not seen any new NPLs in January to February, we are preparing for more to come just to be on the safe side. This means that even though 2024 will remain challenging, we are prepared in the best possible way. The restructuring we have completed so far plus the €0.5 billion, which we will resolve in the first quarter are evidence of exactly this. The challenges posed by the current market situation are substantial without any question but we can deal with them. Thanks to our significantly increased earnings power, we are able to weather developments, such as those seen last year while showing respectable profitability for the bank at the same time. In fact, our profitability was very close to the previous year's level for the bank. We not only have the financial resources necessary to deal with such a situation as a further strength our bank has an experienced team that has seen such cycles several times before in different markets and has the knowledge and the tools to implement customized solutions for each individual case. Everyone is talking about US offices today, but the problems in this segment overshadow the perception of the entire commercial property finance business. The vast majority of our widely diversified commercial property financing portfolio is stable and healthy. This was also true in 2023. One thing that's particularly important to me is that there are clear differences between the office markets in the US and in Europe. We saw one single new NPL exposure in Europe last year, which needed to be restructured. The case involved a retail property in France and will be settled or is already settled in the first quarter of this year without a substantial loss. As part of the overall picture, we have also used 2023 to invest heavily into Aareon and into the reduction of legacy NPL exposures. We consciously accepted these additional non-recurring charges on our annual results in order to further strengthen the position of Aareal Bank Group. Following these comments, let us now turn to the figures. As you know, our group consists of two parts whose development we have illustrated here on this slide. On the left, the banking business, which comprises of our commercial property financing portfolio and our services to the housing and energy sectors in Germany. On the right, our software business, which comprises all of Aareon's activities, plus, generally speaking, the ERP systems and other digital services for the European property and housing industries. First, the bank. The strong growth in earnings was a very positive factor for the year under review. The aggregate of net interest income and net commission income exceeded €1 billion for the first time, an increase of 31% over 2022. It was thanks to this strong profitability that we were able to offset the provisions arising from the US office market and to afford significant investments. We increased the loan loss of loans to €510 million. This item is largely driven by write-downs on US office property loans, which amounted to €360 million. But it also includes conscious expenditure of €115 million for running down our exposure to Russia and some legacy non-performing loans. Our NPL ratio, which has risen slightly as a result of the new NPLs related to use office property financings, will markedly decrease again as a result of the restructurings I mentioned. By the end of the first quarter of 2024, NPLs will have roughly returned to the prior year's level, that means to 2022 levels. We have continued to keep costs fully under control. Our cost income ratio, which is excellent by comparison with our peers, stands at 32%, which costs stable within the bank. As far as capital is concerned, despite growth and turbulence on the markets, we were even able to slightly increase our CET1 ratio to 19.4%. And despite a substantial loan loss allowance and proactive investments, the bank's 2023 operating profits amounted to €221 million and was close to target and prior year. This is evidence of the bank's strong operating profitability and resilience and a very important aspect, especially in times like these. It also puts our consolidated operating profit of €149 million into perspective. Without the investments of around €100 million in our software subsidiary, Aareon, we would have reached the target corridor notwithstanding the loss allowance for exposures in the US in 2023. So let's take a look at Aareon. We used the last year to make these significant investments into Aareon, as already mentioned, of just under €100 million, a good €60 million more than originally planned at the beginning of the year. We have thus optimized our product range, invested in sales and processes, and have also enhanced efficiency. When you asked me at the 2022 annual press conference two years ago I was not complying with some shareholders demand to spin off or sell Aareon, I said the company was not ready yet. Today, I can tell you that we achieved the targets we had set for Aareon for 2025 already at the end of 2023. The share of recurring revenues compared to total revenues continued to increase last year from 74% to 81% bringing a high degree of stability to the income structure of Aareon. Aareon enjoyed strong organic and inorganic growth since 2021. It has consolidated its structures and expanded its business throughout Europe. In addition to the DACH region, it is in France, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, the U.K. and now also in Spain. On the earnings side, Aareon is also well on track. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a key indicator increased by 33% to €100 million last year reflecting Aareon's strong operating performance at the same time its adjusted EBITDA margin climbed from 25% to 29%. This has enabled us to evolve Aareon into a Rule of 40 company, faster than originally planned. This key performance indicator for software companies means that the sum of Aareon's adjusted EBITDA margin last year 29% and revenue growth last year 12% exceeds 40%. Aareon has now passed this threshold. Moreover, we succeeded in refinancing our subsidiary last year. The facility previously provided by Aareal Bank to Aareon was replaced by external long-term debt and we strengthened Aareon's capitalization via a capital increase in the last year as well. These facts tell us that Aareon is ready for the capital markets sooner than planned. One of the things we want to do in the future is to exploit further growth potential by strengthening the partnership between the bank and Aareon over the long-term. To this end, we have placed the collaboration between Aareal Bank and Aareon on a new footing via First Financial, which is at the heart of a new joint venture between Aareon and Aareal Bank. The Bank and Aareon will benefit from this equal measure. Together we want to offer even better solutions to the housing and commercial property industries in Germany and in Europe, and realize significant efficiency potential for our clients. What does it mean specifically? Firstly, we want to tap into the additional growth potential that Aareon's German client base represents for the Bank's deposit taking business. Secondly, we are exploring opportunities to expand the deposit taking business to Aareon's international clientele. And thirdly, we are investing in First Financial, which provides software and payment services thus creating the basis for Aareon Pay, a new product group for integrated payment solutions within Aareon. By taking the partnership between the bank and Aareon to a new level, we have created an important new approach that will contribute to continued profitable growth for both parts of the group. At the same time, we have established new strategic options for our group. Let me summarize. We made substantial investments in the substance of the group during the financial year under review and shoulders heavy burden in the U.S. Nonetheless thanks to our strong operating performance, we achieved a respectable consolidated operating profit of €149 million. At the same time, we significantly strengthened the bank's operational resilience and further improved Aareon's position. We are as well placed to continue growing profitably. We want to more than double. We want to really more than double our consolidated operating profit to between €300 million and €350 million in 2024 million, and do it in an environment that remains challenging. I would now like to hand over to Marc Hess, who will talk about our financial results for the year and review in more detail. Marc, please.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you, Jochen and good morning to you all from my side as well. As Jochen has already pointed out the Bank and Aareon achieved an impressive operating performance in the past financial year especially driven let's say by the earnings momentum that we have seen and you can see on page 5 an overview of the main indicators. First the bank. I think we can say it was a very difficult market environment. Nevertheless, the Bank generated an operating profit of €221 million. And this is not only close to the original target, but it's also close to the prior year despite the active NPL management that we were pursuing and unbundling charges -- some unbundling charges of Aareon. Over two years, we have more than doubled the pre-provision profit of or to now €731 million. That's up 67% and or €300 million only in last year. And we believe this is clear evidence that we have a significantly improved what we call operating resilience since we launched our new next level strategy back in 2021 early 2021. So on that basis we are also able to slightly increase our CET1 ratio to 19.4% despite of the portfolio growth and of course despite of the market headwinds. When we're looking at the fully loaded figures so -- for fully phased in with an output flow of 72.5%. We would be at 13.4% already. That's also up compared to 2022 by 0.1 percentage points. So we were at 30.3% at the end of 2022. Looking at Aareon, we originally announced investments for 2023 of €35 million. During the year, we even found more opportunities. So we invested €61 million more than originally planned all-in-all €96 million. And therefore we are now ahead of plan and we expect a contribution of €20 million from these investments already in 2024 going on. And therefore the EBITDA which did perform nicely on an adjusted basis last year will even be up this year to €160 million to €170 million in that range. Turning to the next page looking even in more detail at the Bank generating an operating profit of €221 million as I just said. We had additional expenses for restructuring the Aareon third-party debt facility which was originally given by the Bank to Aareon and now financed externally that was another €10 million burden here last year which was obviously unplanned. So if you include that we would even have been at €231 million. This is why I'm saying really not far away from the original plan and also not far away from 2022. And this despite of the really significant risk provisions that we built which I would like to explain. For 2022 they totaled €510 million you know that is including the fair value P&L line always so a little bit more than only shown in the risk provision line. Two-thirds of that obviously applied to the US office loan book. But these provisions enabled us to really actively manage our NPL book and thus significantly reduce the NPLs. One on the legacy side which we announced when we went into the year, here we said we wanted to reuse them. We finally did by €500 million more than we expected. That was also a little bit taking more risk provision than we originally expected. And I think in these times that's even more important we prepared the way for solution of another €500 million non-performing US office loans now in the first quarter of 2024 already. Here we booked another, let's say, €75 million in Q4 to really accelerate this process. So as I just said we want to restructure them we want to reduce the NPLs by €500 million office in the first quarter this year and this is 50% of the total US office NPL book. So we believe a clear market test. Coming to the outlook. We are targeting an operating profit of €250 million to €300 million just for the bank in 2024. Next page shows the Aareon, how did it develop in the recent years? Well, revenues have been rising from as you can see here €269 million in the year 2021 to now €344 million, so dynamic development. Jochen will elaborate on that in more detail later on. And we are expecting as you can see a strong growth to -- well not even to continue -- even to accelerate in 2024. So we are targeting a range of €440 million to €460 million in revenues. That also has of course positive implications on the adjusted EBITDA, which was also performing nicely. So obviously here all the investments that we took are not reflected, it increased by -- from €75 million to €100 million in 2023. And here we expect another increase to €160 million, €170 million range in 2024. As I just said, we had significant investments, which we did in 2023 deliberately. We planned €35 million as you can see in the chart at the end it was €96 million, and that led to a negative EBT or PBT contribution in our segment reporting of minus €72 million but we will have a strong turnaround given that these investments, of course, will not be continued and they will show positive effects. So all-in-all from minus €72 million to plus €50 million in 2024. If we are looking at the summary of the income statement on page 8, we had an original operating profit target of €250 million for the group. This included the €95 million of investments that you can see on the table. And as I said, we invested more in a swift NPL reduction, more in Aareon. So I think this explains the deviation. In total, €221 million spend in 2023. So I think we can really say that we invested into the future basis of this bank heavily. So this is the reported results on the operating side. As I said the momentum remained really strong. And this is why we are targeting an operating profit target of €300 million to €350 million for 2024 as Jochen just explained. And this includes loan loss provisions that are expected to gain above average or I would even say significantly above average, but below what we saw last year with this swift reduction program. So we think we are really prepared to be -- really prepared the best way for 2024. If we are looking back into 2023 and the individual items, you can see here strong momentum in net interest income 39% up. So just under €1 billion, same is true for net commission income. Fees were up 11%. Most of that obviously coming from Aareon. And these are new record levels for the bank. In NII this reflects both segments of the bank I have to say and BDS in the RSF business commercial real estate lending, we had portfolio growth but we also had very good margins. You will hear that here at that later on. And in BDS, our deposit business of course we benefited from the normalized interest rate environment. As I just said fee income mainly driven by Aareon, risk provisions €520 million. This as I've just mentioned includes the €69 million of the fair value P&L line. And as I also said, the significant risk provisions are attributable to the persistent headwinds of course of the US office market, but also to the investments in active reduction of NPLs. So also to mention we are out of Russia. So we sold our Russian exposure last year, which also let's say cost us like €35 million at the end. Admin expenses while the first site here increased by 13% to €645 million as you can see. But this is only attributable to the investments in Aareon. If you're looking at the bank, costs remained mainly stable and the cost/income ratio even improved significantly from 40% to 32%. We had a high tax burden last year. That's a -- I wouldn't say a technical effect, but a result of the takeover, because here in Germany, when you're taken over by another company which we were Atlantic Bidco as you know, you have to write-sdown the deferred tax assets. And that's simply the fact and this is what brings the tax ratio up this year. With that, back to Jochen.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you, Marc. Let's turn to our business lines and start with Structured Property Financing. You see here on the Page 10 with a portfolio size of €32.9 billion, we reached our portfolio target for the past financial year. Average loan-to-value ratios in the existing portfolio remained at a healthy 56%. Our portfolio composition has not changed much, compared to the end of 2022. Hotels remain our largest asset class and Europe, remains our largest region. Germany accounts for only 7% of our total business. And we are no longer involved in China or Russia. And we have only minimal involvement in Property Developments that accounts for less than 1% of our portfolio. However, we do continue to finance buildings that are being renovated, to enhance their energy efficiency. This is evident in our growing green loan portfolio which now stands at €4.8 billion in which we want to grow between €6 billion and €7 billion by 2026. Our total Lending Volume Classified as Green rose to €9 billion now accounting for 28% of our portfolio. On the next page and you see we hit our new business target of €10 million. In doing so, we've grown across all asset classes, but especially in hotels and especially in Western Europe. We also selectively underwriting business in the US, in finance offices and the markets we cover. Although the office market in the US is currently experiencing a significant downturn, offices account for the vast majority of the Global Commercial Property Markets. There are excellent properties that require upgrading to the latest ESG standards in this sector and that's why just under one-third of our total new business was green loans of which, €1.3 billion went into offices, representing around 70% of our new business in office properties. However, the bulk of our business continues to be in Hotel Financing. A good example is the financing of the Le Méridien Étoile in Paris for Henderson Park Capital Partners. This hotel enjoys a prime location opposite the Congress Center just minutes from Champs Élysées and the Arc de Triomphe. We have also grown in new asset classes. Last September, we formed a dedicated team to finance alternative living properties. The objective is to further expand our business in this growth segment which comprises student housing, micro apartments and co-living. We are already one of the leading providers in this sector. And for example, we financed a £380 million portfolio, comprising three student accommodation properties in London last year. The bank has also been active in New Zealand since last year a good complement to our already established market coverage in Australia. This enables us to serve clients who are active in both markets from a single source. And in principle financings in New Zealand are eligible for inclusion and fund lease cover, offering attractive financing options especially for hotels and in the alternative living sector. What is important for all new business is that we continue to assign high priority to conservative risk standards. Loan-to-value ratios for new business averaged 54% in 2023. We also continued to achieve very attractive gross margins averaging approximately 290 basis points clearly exceeding 2022 margins. Let's now take a look at the key indicators in the loan book. The KPIs in our portfolio remain in a healthy range and are better overall than in 2019, the year before the pandemic. Despite the strong headwinds from the US office market, the average loan-to-value ratio of 56% is at a very conservative level. Debt servicing capacity yield on debt, once again improved significantly to 9.6%. Hotels in particular are doing very well with strong cash flows. Thanks to the clear pickup in travel after the pandemic. The retail sector has also recovered faster and more distinctly than many expected. Overall, much of life has returned to normal after the pandemic and we are seeing the effects. At this point, I would like to point out a parallel between retail and office properties. Retail properties had already been declared dead because of the trends towards online shopping. However, we have helped and continue to hold the opinion that the market is changing with differentiating factors, which is – which is why we have continued to finance very well-positioned retail properties. Now the office property markets are changing due to the trend of working from home. And here too new criteria for measuring quality will have to be applied in the future. Of course, location remains the most important differentiating factor but sustainable carbon-efficient properties with flexible space concepts will play an increasingly important role. And this has also been a factor in selecting new business for us in 2023 already. The next slide shows the breakdown of our performing office property finance portfolio by country. The US accounts for the largest share, followed by France, the UK, Poland, Sweden and Belgium. Germany only accounts for 3% or roughly €250 million. In this context, it is notable that average loan-to-value ratios for our office portfolio stand at 70%, whereas in Europe the figure is 55%. This is a clear indication that developments in the US office market have not spilled over to Europe. Why is that the case? Certainly, a different interest rate environment and lower vacancy rates in the European markets. For example, we see in Paris 8%, which is a much lower number compared to certain cities in the US. Also ownership structures differ between the continents. In Europe, this often leads to longer investment horizon. This means that there is a greater willingness in Europe, to repay debt through new equity injections in order to maintain equity positions and keep the properties. And in European real estate financing we see interest rate hedges, additionally commercial real estate in Europe is generally not financed by different layers of that leading to lower LTVs and a very limited market for junior and mass tranches. There are also some so-called soft facts. For example, in the US, it generally takes much longer to get to work from home. People in the US also tend to have larger houses or flats than here in European cities, which makes working from home a lot more attractive from a US perspective. In addition, European cities often offer a better mix of areas where you can live, shop and work at the same time. This means that you may live a little closer to work in European cities compared to in the US and the quality of life in central office locations can be higher in Europe. It is I guess fair to say that overall, we currently see no signs that developments in the US are directly spilling over into Europe. This is due in particular to structural differences between the two markets that I have just described. However, it should be noted that poor properties in poor locations will also face problems in Europe but this is a universal principle in commercial property that has nothing to do with the current market development. On the next page, now let us look further at our US office loan portfolio. A large part of the portfolio is located in New York with the rest mainly spread through other major cities. We concentrate on high-quality Class A properties in A markets. Most of our performing loans have maturities in 2025 or later and only €240 million is due in 2024. The values of all the office properties were reviewed in 2023 and around 80% of these valuations were undertaken externally. We found that a little over half of the market values have decreased by up to 20% since the end of 2022 and that the others were down by between 20% and 55%. These market value decreases are reflected in increase in the average LTV, which is up from 62% at the end of 2022 to 70% for the US office property loan portfolio at the end of 2023. The revised level includes new business with an LTV of 50% and outflows in NPLs. On page 15, we are monitoring -- you see we are monitoring all US office loans closely and have a regular interaction with our borrowers. We expect high-quality buildings in allocations to recover first and this is the category where our loans are focused. Additionally, we expect the level of interest rates in 2024 to take pressure out of the market and help to stabilize values. At the end of 2023, we again stress tested our portfolio for a further 20% decline in value. The stress test showed that the average LTV of our US office portfolio would increase from 70% to 88%. And one correction please, please read on the chart, on the upper part of the chart the LTV of the performing US office portfolio not at 92%, read please 85%. But again, on the basis of the stressed market values, only around €75 million would have an LTV of over 100% and around €260 million would have an LTV in the range of 80% to 100%. The result shows that we have headroom even under very conservative stress conditions. Now, I would now like to expand a little on a topic that is likely to be of interest in view of the current situation, the development of non-performing loans and how we deal with them. We really reviewed our strategy in early 2022 with a view to resolving NPL cases much more quickly than we used to. And more recently, by the way we hired US industry experts to support our team and these are our colleagues with a great experience and track record from large US banks. But again, back to the year 2022 -- at the beginning of 2022, you see that here on the chart, we had a non-performing loan portfolio of totaling €1.6 billion. Some of these NPLs have already been in the portfolio for many years. And then in 2022, we reduced these old NPLs by around €800 million and in 2023 we made a further reduction of €400 million out of that bucket of €1.6 billion. Only a residual balance of €100 million will remain from these legacy exposures by the end of this year of 2024. Then in 2022, new NPL cases totaling €370 million were added, of which we had reduced around already €300 million by the end of 2023. The remainder will be almost completely removed from the NPL portfolio by the end of this year too. Next to the year 2023 NPLs. Developments on the US office property markets combined with other factors required significant NPL additions of around €1 billion on a net basis last year. Some of these cases were solved quickly that same year. The only European exposure of around €100 million will be settled or is already settled without the loss in the first quarter of this year. €150 million in US office NPLs have already been resolved in 2024 and we have in total scheduled around €0.5 billion for solutions in the first quarter of 2024. So, why I'm explaining all this in such detail? Well, it is important for me to convey two messages to you. Firstly, we actively address these situations and have both the people and the resources to work out a variety of solutions with our clients. And secondly, despite all the challenges, it is about really making real progress in the management of non-performing loans. This costs money, but it is an important prerequisite for success throughout the cycle. Please note that, we are on the same page as our owners in this respect. Our investors expressly support the strategy and share the associated short-term consequences for the bank's financial results, for example, in the last year. All-in-all, our NPE ratio in accordance with the EBA's Risk Dashboard definitions was 3.4% at the end of the year, However, given the reduction of NPLs that has already been prepared, we expect the NPL ratio at the end of March 2024 to be back down to end 2022 levels. We will change over to calculating the NPA ratio in accordance with the EBA's definition this quarter, which most of our competitors use establishing a better comparability. On the next page, I would now like to talk about BDS. The average volume of client deposits from the housing industry rose to €13.6 billion, exceeding the target level of around €13 billion set for the last year in 2023. Our solutions are nowadays used to handle the payment transactions of more than 4,000 clients in the housing and commercial property sectors, who between them are managing more than 9 million rental units. The deposit business this generates is granular and very stable given that we are deeply, really deeply integrated in our clients' payment processes. We have had firm routes in the housing industry now for decades, a business we have maintained even in times of low interest rates for our clients. Today, we are benefiting not only in terms of funding, but also on the earnings side. At €238 million, net interest income for this segment was more than 1.5x the previous year's figure. Whilst this increase reflects the normalized interest rate environment, it is also the result of a consistently high volume of deposits, demonstrating strong client loyalty. On average, our clients remain loyal for more than 20 years. But it is not only net interest income that continues to gain traction, net commission income also did well rising to €33 million in the year under review. This business gives us a second, stable and profitable pillar in the bank and, as you all know, things stand better on 2 feet. And now let's turn to Aareon. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, Aareon has seen an outstanding performance over recent years. It continues to grow at an accelerated pace with sales revenues rising 12% and adjusted EBITDA up by 33% and in 2023. I've already discussed Aareon's Capital Markets readiness and the long-term partnership between the bank and Aareon. In terms of business activities, Aareon has further expanded its geographical footprint in Europe by entering the Spanish market in 2023. And Furthermore, during the past financial year, Aareon acquired Embrace, a Dutch provider of CRM solutions and UTS a company for managers of condominium owners associations here in Germany. The M&A credit line previously provided by Aareal Bank, which we refer to as a hunting line has been replaced by Aareon's external long-term debt financing. Even though the change will low double-digit million charge per annum, it shows that Aareon is capable of raising finance on its own, and that's a further important milestone. So Marc will now look at our funding activities and, of course, our capital base and then explain our outlook to you.\nMarc Hess: Yeah. Thank you, Jochen. Turning to page 20, the pie chart here, I think shows very well how diversified our funding structure has become that was one of the major cornerstones of our strategy to really diversify the funding more than originally and thus become more independent from the capital market. And I think we can really say today that we made good progress, of course, as you can see BDS is one major source of our funding. Pfandbriefe are of course still the most important capital market instruments. In total, also can see we've seen here at the chart, we had to tap the capital markets by €2.4 billion last year, significantly less than in the previous year, despite of the growth that what we have seen. And I can also say today, that there is no need to raise any senior preferred funding, at the Capital Markets in 2024 and 2025 and we did not have the capital market here in 2023, as well that was on the private placements the €0.2 billion. To get more independent from the capital market, I think one major element is Raisin. We started the comparison in 2022, we had €600 million deposits at the end of 2022. And this has been grown to € 2.6 billion, just at the end of last year. So, very important. And these are all term deposits, fixed interest and more than 90% have a term of two years and more. So, very reliable source on that end. We even plan to further strengthen our cooperation with Raisin, we are the first German bank to go on their international platform. So, in early February, I think it was the sixth - we started to be on their Dutch platform, and we want to expand that during 2024 even to other European markets. So, I think a very stable situation on that side and this can be reflected if you look on Page 21, you can see the liquidity ratios. They are all well above the minimum regulatory requirements. We have -- as can be seen here considerable buffers in the LCR and the NSFR and these have been kept basically on the same level, despite of the volume growth that we have seen. So, what we also can say, I think it's also important to note here, that the terms of our fundings have longer terms than our property financing. So, the funding terms are around four years while the property finance portfolio has typically, a term of three years. So, very balanced and with the buffer on that side. I think also good news on the capital situation, very solid. Page 23, you can see that we have a CET1 ratio that has been increased over the last couple of years, despite of all the crisis -- that we had to face -- so -- no sorry -- I'm not jumping one page, going back. I'm going back to Page 22. So looking at the Pfandbriefe, as I just mentioned obviously, it's one of our main funding instruments at the capital markets. What you can see here we have a AAA rated Pfandbriefe with the Moody's rating of AAA the cover pool is €16.5 billion diversified over 20 countries. And we have an LTV in this cover pool of 33.5%. So as you know, the Pfandbriefe standards are very conservative and we are of course in line to reach the Moody's rating we are relying on overcapitalization, even on top that's 16.5%, and we even are above that threshold with 19.6%. So also here very comfortable buffers. So now to CET1 capital on Page 23. As I just said, we have been improving that despite of all the crisis that we had to face, be it COVID, be it Russia, be it now the US crisis, and we are now at 19.4%. So despite of portfolio growth, despite of the LTVs coming under pressure on the US offices, we even increased it by 1 -- 0.1 percentage points during 2023. And 19.4% very sound ratios. Also happy to give you the fully phased ratio, with the 17.5% output flow that's 13.4%. So I think also very comfortable also an increase by 0.1 percentage points. And leverage ratio also to be mentioned 6.6% that compares to 6.0% end of 2022. So now, not to get confused again, going to the outlook. I think we can say that the environment will remain challenging from different aspects. The economic development most likely sluggish, inflation persisting, I think there was more optimism in the market at the end of last year. Nevertheless, we will see first interest rate reductions. That's good and bad for our bank. Obviously, we benefit because we do have a diversified business model in our two segments. We benefit from higher interest rates as you have seen in the net interest income of our BDS segment from the deposits of the other -- on the other hand of course higher rates weight on the valuation of commercial real estate, which leads them to higher risk provisions. So all-in-all, we expect first rate cuts by mid of this year as many others do, which I would say has a neutral effect then on us on both sides. If you add it up -- all-in-all with regards to the U.S. office property market, we only expect a little improvement certainly not in the first half of this year, and this is also reflected in our risk provisioning planning. Nevertheless, we are optimistic about the Group's performance in 2024. As you can see here in the bank, we want to continue to grow our credit portfolio, but less than in the previous years. So just by €1 billion that also means less new business is needed €8 billion to €9 billion, which means that we can continue to be very selective here. And we expect stable deposits on the BDS side of around €13 billion. So all-in-all, the bank's operating profit as Jochen already mentioned and me too should increase to €250 million to €300 million despite of the risk provisions, which are projected to remain at above average levels. We mentioned today this morning in the press conference that we expect that we plan for around €350 million of risk provisions for 2023. So significantly below -- for 2024, --sorry -- significantly below 2023 especially the swift NPL reduction for the legacy portfolio, of course, is not necessary. This gives us some relief here. Of course, the markedly increased profitability is one factor why we expect to reach these high levels on a PBT basis. When it comes to -- when it comes to Aareon, we will continue to grow. As I already said, we expect really -- impressive from my point of view increases in the revenues. As I said, the foundation was laid in 2023 and 2023 and the year before EBITDA should of course benefit from that here. In addition, we will benefit from the efficiency measures, so the investments that we did in 2023. And therefore, on a group level EBT, PBT, however, you want to name it, we expect a positive contribution of €50 million for 2024. And that all-in-all leads to our expectation that we can have a pre-tax profit on the group's level of €300 million to €350 million in 2024. So, now I would like to hand back to Jochen for his closing remarks.\nJochen Klösges : Thank you, Marc. Yes, please allow me to summarize in conclusion. Firstly, we finished the 2023 financial year with respectable results, which was characterized by strong growth in income, a high level of investments, and of course, significant challenges from the U.S. office market. Secondly, we have invested in the substance of Aareal Bank Group and further strengthened the foundations for profitable growth both for the bank and for Aareon in the years to come. And thirdly, we are confident that in a still challenging environment we will more than double our consolidated operating profit in the current year. This confident outlook holds a fundamental message. Yes, the current situation is very challenging indeed. But as we have shown this year, we are actively managing these challenges. And since we are pursuing long-term goals, we are continuously working on improving our business models. And we are convinced that the investments of recent years will pay off. Marc and I will be happy now to answer your questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Christian Leukers from CQS. Please go ahead.\nChristian Leukers: Good morning. Thank you. You have a very strong front book margin. So there's obviously a good organic opportunity to sort of grow your book and you've got lots of capital to do that. How would the shareholders or your sort of owners look at inorganic opportunities? Because you did mention M&A for Aareon, but what about for Aareal, because there might be some opportunities in the market there on the M&A side as well. Thank you.\nJochen Klösges: Yes. I must say, it's today way too early to talk about that. Regarding Aareon, we are quite happy with the development we saw in the last year in terms of growth on the sales side, recurring revenues and EBITDA and Marc explained that we are also having very ambitious targets for Aareon in -- for the year '24 and to really execute on the success of Aareon and to see the results of the business basically then delivering on these targets is our clear focus. So it's way too early to talk about M&A. And I guess that's also the view of our shareholders.\nMarc Hess: And with regards to the bank, I think that was your question. We don't believe really that M&A is needed to further develop our business. As you have seen, we can grow organically. Here we very strongly focus on profitability. I think this is reflected in the margins. So on the BDS side, we are I can say so not looking for any M&A opportunity on the RFZ [ph] side. So we are not looking for any M&A opportunities. On the BDS side, so on the deposit side, you have seen very small acquisitions, like we acquired an artificial intelligence company in order to really support our services and our processes that was in the low single-digit million euro area in terms of acquisition price. If we have something here at the market that would really help us to improve our services, we would look at that. But no broader M&A plan.\nChristian Leukers: If I look at your new business outlook in structured property finance, it's slightly lower than the '23 number. Is that -- given the new margin is that -- are you sort of just being conservative? Or could be outperformed there on the new business side? You've got €8 billion, €9 billion.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Yes that's what I just mentioned. It's a little bit lower than last year. Last year, we grew by €2 billion. This year we want to grow by €1 billion. As I said, the focus is very much on profitable growth. So we want to be selective and this is just reflected in these figures.\nChristian Leukers: All right. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Graham Stuart from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nGraham Stuart: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple. You said, you haven't seen any new NPLs year-to-date, but you want to be conservative. Can you talk a little bit about your new NPL inflow assumptions for '24 please? And then secondly, on this disposal of €0.5 billion of US office NPLs at 26% coverage, I mean I guess I've always thought about coverage levels of 50% to get rid of CRE NPLs. So, what comfort can you give me that 25% coverage is really the right level to exit these loans please? Thank you.\nMarc Hess: Hi Stuart. Thank you for your question. I will take the two. The first question -- let's answer the second question first. What comfort can we give you? Well, as we just explained, we want to solve and therefore reduce our NPL on the US office book in the first quarter this year so the first month. And if April is even included whatever so really now actually by €500 million, that's 50%. We are already in the negotiations. We have provisioned them in the fourth quarter and we don't expect additional loan loss provisions for that reduction. So I think that is a market test. And therefore we can say we are confident that our provisioning levels are right. Of course this is a very swift a very quick reduction. So, this is why we took let's say another €75 million on top in risk provisions in Q4 that is for me really an excellent premium. It's like with a car, you have a value of €20,000, if you want to sell it next week, yes, probably you have to accept a little bit lower price. So, this is exactly what we are doing here. And this is why I'm saying I think overall that's a good test. And--\nJochen Klösges: Yes. Yes. And then the other question I guess was about the potential NPL inflow in 2024. And yes this is pretty complicated to give you a forecast about that. You see Marc already elaborated on our overall forecast for 2024. That includes still a pretty high number of NLPs as a budget for 2024 compared to normal is a little bit lower than last year but still a significant number. And you could probably also take away from our explanations that we are still pretty much cautious about the development of the U.S. office market in 2024 and our focus is clearly on restructuring all the single cases together with our clients. When I take a look at our European portfolio including office. So, far I can say you know that also the office markets in Europe are exposed to higher interest rates and to the work from home issues. But so far we saw no negative impact within our portfolio. We mentioned that we had one new NPL in Europe last year and that was a retail property in France, which has already been paid back -- I guess it was yesterday. That was paid back without any substantial losses here on our side yes. So, you see me here knocking on wood and nobody knows exactly what the future will bring. But currently we see clear distinctions between the dynamics in U.S. office markets and European office markets, but we are still cautious and carefully monitoring everything.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. Maybe if I could just go back to your first ask again. I mean you're saying you're going to get to these NPLs already in Q1. I mean we're in almost in March. So, you must have had some pretty detailed conversations. I mean can you just confirm these are professional real estate investors who if there was going to be an allergic reaction to your kind of pricing levels would have you already had that kind of allergic reaction. Just to give me comfort that this isn't something where you're going to come back and say sorry it ends up going nowhere.\nMarc Hess: Yes you can confirm that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nMarc Hess: And again be rest assured when we are now talking about these €0.5 billion talks about that, because that already started I don't know in fall or in late summer or now in last year. So we are in constant conversations with the clients. So this is nothing which can be realized within one weak here. That's what I want to say.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from [indiscernible] from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for the call. A couple of questions from my side. On, Aareon just trying understand how if ever it was supposed it could affect capital would you be able to give us what the current mark of your share of Aareon is currently marked at effectively on a deconsolidated basis the RWAs associated with that? And then also any CET1 goodwill deductions are occurring because specifically of Aareon that would be the first question. The second question when I go through your CRR disclosures the RWA densities. I think I last had on the CRE book close to like 25% that seemed a lot lower than a number of peers. Just wondering could you just help me understand what the reasons behind that are? And as kind of PEs go up and LGDs probably creep up, what are your views on how those RWAs move over the course of 2024 and 2025? And then the third question is just around the BDS deposits. Are there any kind of ratings triggers where any of that will kind of move to other providers or things like that?\nJochen Klösges: Yeah. So let me start with the last question about BDS deposits. We're doing the deposit taking business with our BDS clients here within the bank for decades now. Finally, we are talking about, trying to speak about two types of deposits. One kind of deposits are rental deposits and deposits for the condominium associations here, which is very stable, very granular, small amounts and we basically are able to help our clients to process these deposits in the most efficient way and that's why they are doing the business with us. The other things are the side deposits and they basically represent the working capital of all clients. And that again, we are also pretty deeply involved into their payment processes and that's why we saw and see currently the very stable development of the overall BDS deposits. Then I'm not quite sure whether I understood your first question. I guess Marc will take the question about the RWAs. The first question was about Aareon and potential valuation of Aareon. Is that right?\nUnidentified Analyst: No, just the book value. So above what level effectively do you trigger the P&L gain? And then also there must be on a consolidated basis there would be some CT1 deduction for the goodwill to try and understand what those amounts are? So let's say you removed Aareon on a book value effectively how the capital would change.\nJochen Klösges: So again, Marc will take the question about the RWAs and sorry, we do not disclose the book value of Aareon. We did that not so far, I guess. And yeah, you see the amount of money we finally invested into Aareon in the last, also three years. Secondly, you see the very impressive EBITDA development, I guess in 2021 it was roughly 65, now we're targeting 160. That shows you that we clearly have the target to create a significant amount of value. But please, please forgive me that I am not willing to speculate about a potential value of Aareon not disclose our book value currently. Sorry, yeah?\nMarc Hess: And this, of course, then goes hand in hand with the RWAs. I mean, what I can confirm is how you look at it. Aareon is not consolidated for regulatory purposes. That means that we only have to account for their book value as RWA, but obviously if we now would disclose the RWA, you could recalculate the book value. So sorry for that. Here, we would like to get to give the details. And then I think your last question or it was...\nUnidentified Analyst: It was on the risk entities. They were coming -- when I last saw the CRR disclosures, they were coming in at like 25%. That seemed low versus some fears. I was just trying to understand how that is expected to develop over 2024 and 2025 as PDs and LGDs kind of increase?\nMarc Hess: It's a very difficult, a very bad line, So let me interpret what you said. You said the RWA weighting, yeah?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah, yeah, exactly. The density.\nMarc Hess: The RWA density, that's what you're talking about. You say it's below other competitors?\nUnidentified Analyst: Correct, yeah. And I just want to understand how that would progress as kind of PDs and LGDs went up.\nMarc Hess: Yeah, sure. Well, of course, we are running internal models, so we are on an IRBA model. IRBA, of course, model here, as you can see, we are already taking the higher off, yeah. So we are calculating the standard approach under Basel IV, currently with a 50% output floor. And we are also calculating the revised IRBA and then compare and take the higher off in RWA, so this is the €19.4 million. Well, what is in there? And are they as you say or interpret them comparatively low, because we have high collateralization and we have good values, good LTVs especially. This market development had some impact. You can see that we are up €900 million this year. Of course that reflects the growth of our portfolio. But it also reflects the LTV changes. Of course, we also have given that the Aareon hunting line is now out as said, it's a not consolidated entity from regulator purposes. So it was fully backed with RWAs. Here we had a relief of around €200 million and this was consumed basically by higher charges due to the value development of the total book, which was influenced by US office. But as you have seen before with the LTVs, the LTV of the book only went up by 1%. So don't be surprised that this was hardly a development. For me it's difficult to compare that to others. I don't know what others do and how their models look like. These are our models. And, of course, they are reviewed by the supervisors. If we go to a Basel IV fully view, here you can see we have given full transparency. Commercial real estate obviously is hit most by the introduction of Basel IV and the 72.5% output floor because the collateralization is not taking into account in the way it was before. So here I think that's very comparable then. We are at 13.4% and therefore still I think on comfortable levels.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.\nMarc Hess: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Jérôme Legras from Axiom AI. Please go ahead.\nJérôme Legras: Yeah. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Actually two questions on capital market funding. The first one is you mentioned, no preferred senior needs but possibly non-preferred senior. So happy to hear your thoughts about non-preferred senior benchmark issuance with the current spread environment, which is of course quite challenging? And the second question is on your fund raise bonds, whether you have issues with US office loans, which are in the cover pool if you have to remove them, if you have had to remove some or if there is a risk that you might need some new assets as collateral for the cover pool if the LTVs go above a specific threshold either for regulatory reasons or because of the rating agencies? Thank you.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you very much for your questions. As I just said for liquidity purpose, we don't need to tap the market with a senior preferred issuance. We still would like to do a senior non-preferred issuance this year. So a benchmark size, €500 million. This is to keep the subordination of the Moody's rating. So it only has rating purposes, it doesn't have any liquidity purposes. Therefore, as you said in the current market environment, which is certainly seeing accelerated spreads at very low turnovers and hopefully after the presentation of our set of figures today, they will come back to somewhat normalized levels. But in the current environment that wouldn't be, I think possible or at least not from a commercial point of view interesting. So as I just mentioned, most likely we would tap the market if the conditions are right, is there any plan for the next six months? No there is not. So potentially at the end of the year if the market has normalized then we would look for that senior non-preferred benchmark issuance. What we do regarding the cover pool, of course, we always manage it actively. That means we always take out NPL. So as you have seen we have €1 billion NPLs in US office new in 2023. Presumably some of that was in the cover pool that's always replaced and there is no NPLs in the cover pool, and of course also let's say we have to manage it according to all the other thresholds that have to be matched.\nJérôme Legras: My question was more on performing loans if beyond some kind of LTV threshold on performing most of the offices loan, you have to take them out even if they are not NPLs?\nMarc Hess: To be honest, I have to clarify. So, we would like to come back to you. If you just call our IR partner, he will give you the answer right away. I'm aware of the policy regarding NPLs but we will clarify that.\nJérôme Legras: Okay. Thank you.\nMarc Hess: Of course all the thresholds as I just said have to be met and the LTV on the pool is like 33.\nOperator: The next question is from Jakub Lichwa from TwentyFour. Please go ahead.\nJakub Lichwa: Hi, there. Thanks for holding the call and the Q&A session. So, the first one is actually just on the timing of the sale for the US book. I mean obviously you're indicating Q1, we are nearly in March. Is this something\nJürgen Junginger: Jakub, there's a lot of background noise with you. We can hardly hear you.\nJakub Lichwa: Sorry, can you hear me any better now, just trying to manage.\nJürgen Junginger: Not really. We try, please just try slowly maybe we can chase.\nJakub Lichwa: Okay. So, what is the timing on the sale of the US book?\nMarc Hess: Well, as we said that's time for now for the first quarter. I'm not saying that this may not take until the 15th of April, but we would certainly like to give you a positive message then with our Q1 results. So, it's time for now.\nJakub Lichwa: Okay. What is IPR on the new business at the moment?\nMarc Hess: We will have a look. So let us check that. Maybe we take the next question and we come back to that still during that call.\nOperator: Next question is from Alexei Lougovtsov [ph]. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thank you very much for the results and encouraging guidance. I have a couple of questions. So, on the NPL formation €1 billion of NPLs that were added in the US last year, how did it happen? Were those loans maturing in 2023? Or did they going to nonperforming because of interest payment default and subsequent acceleration? And my second question is about the overall portfolio slide 10. 37% of loans classified as in Western Europe. Could you please provide more color on which countries are in Western Europe on that chart? And also, your exposure to Germany is quite low. Do you view it as a positive or a negative?\nMarc Hess: Yes. Interesting question. I think in these days, we view it as a positive. I think you have all read that the German market is also under pressure. Also important from our side to stress, we are not financing any developments. Here you know that in Germany, there is particular -- stress in particular and we also do not have any signal exposure. So, when it comes to Western Europe, I can just give you the figures. It's Belgium €600 million, it's mainly France €3.7 billion. It's UK €5.3 billion. We have very little in Luxembourg, Netherlands €1.7 billion and then Austria and Switzerland, both €300 billion. So this is how Western Europe is comprised. Germany, as you have seen is then in addition €2.2 billion. So that was total commercial real estate, yes all the object classes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, yes. I understand.\nJochen Klösges: Yes. And regarding your question about the NPL evolution in the US last year, yes, so multiple things can happen that finally alone is qualified as an NPL. It's not really -- the trigger is not really -- is a loan due. It's more about is there an assessment that it's unlikely to pay -- then obviously, if it's 90 days past due, then finally if the client and the property together can't meet our cash flow requirements, meet the debt service cover requirements or in some cases we see then reach of covenants. And so all these events – events are monitored, valued and then negotiated with the clients. and – but there are clear rules when a performing loan has to be reclassified as an NPL and that is always also checked and tested by our auditors and by many involved parties. So I hope that answers your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: It does. Thank you very much. It is very helpful.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Fenner-Leitao from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.\nPaul Fenner-Leitao: Hi, team. Thanks very much for the presentation. I've got two kind of add-on questions to ones that have already been asked. On the issuance of NPS, you mentioned a loss given failure specifically. You've got a negative outlook at Moody's. It's been on for a while. Do you think the prospect of the issuance of that bond protect your A3 senior rating? Is that the idea? What are you hearing? What are the latest conversations with Moody's? Or is it a given that that gets downgraded? And could that change if you do get downgraded, before you issue this year? Does that mean that you're less likely to need to issue? Question number one. Question number two, is you've got an AT1 outstanding that you didn't call a couple of years ago, got decent regulatory capital position you're well above your subs, the bond is trading well below par. What are your – can you just update us on your philosophy around the potential call? And what's your appetite for liability management of that bond you could get a decent gain out of it? Thank you.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you for your questions. Well, of course, when it comes to Moody's, these are confidential conversations we have with them. So obviously, I cannot, let's say, talk about the discussions we have with them. Obviously, as I just said, we would like to place a senior non-preferred still this year at the end of this year in order to support the subordination and therefore to keep the up-notching. I think that's somehow independent from the yearly revenue of the rating that will take place, let's say on a regular basis here. As you know, we have a negative outlook now for I think more than two years. On the one hand, obviously the situation on the US office market is difficult, that weights on commercial real estate finances that weighs on us. On the other hand of course, we have today presented from our point of view a decent set of figures. I think we have provisioned comprehensively on the one side. We have certainly shown very good momentum on the revenues. Costs are under control. Liquidity is – has substantial buffers, very solid level of our CET1. And we think this should all be reflected. And hopefully, we can keep our A minus rating here with Moody's. This is certainly what we are working on. With regards on the AT1, what's our philosophy? Well you've seen we have not called them last year. We didn't call them the year before. That was always quite difficult market environments. We are still in a difficult environment. I mean last year remember there was -- exactly at this point in time there was Credit Suisse. There was the US regional banks. The year before Russia just invaded the Ukraine. The year before COVID started so very difficult market environment. This year, well we are still talking about US and you have seen the elevated spreads on AT1. I mean, it's very clear if we call it we have to replace it. So would you, let's say, advisers to do it now? Probably not. We have not taken the decision yet but I think you can read my words here.\nPaul Fenner-Leitao: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Anke Reingen from RBC. Please go ahead. \nAnke Reingen: Yes. Thank you very much for taking my question. Two more simple questions. First is -- with respect to there have been a few articles or comments that the regulators to provide focusing is on commercial real estate. Do you expect that might accelerate potentially on the pace at which you have to take provisions anything on capital requirements or higher risk ratings? Or what could be the implications be given that there seems to be some focus. And then with respect to US commercial real estate, what do you think will sort of like eventually stabilize the market? Or is the oversupply? Or is it rates coming down? Is it just time? Just that would be great if you can maybe just shed some light on your thinking. Thank you very much.\nJochen Klösges: Yes. So let me take these questions. So when you -- when you talk about the regulator you know that we are regulated by ECB [indiscernible] bank and BaFin. And we are in constant talks with them in each and every situation. So this is something which is for us as usual. And obviously when something extraordinary happens then we provide them with extra reports and have conversations that is for us currently -- this is as usual and they are obviously following in the picture about everything that's going on here. So nothing really extraordinary for me to mention today about that. And then, yes, what could stabilize the markets. Again I'd really like to emphasize again, If you're talking about Europe, if we're talking about logistics, if we're talking about hotels, if you're talking about retail that all is stable. As I mentioned, we saw no issues currently within these parts of our portfolio. We're still talking about the US office portfolio. And for me I guess the next important step is that everybody will gain some confidence that we will not see further increasing interest rates that basically we all get a grip on inflation rates and that everybody can then now calculate in a much better and sustainable way what are the key parameters for future investments. That's currently very important. Second point is obviously that we do not currently see any new projects coming to the market that was stopped already in 2022 and which each and every quarter which not provides new property to the market. Finally, supply will decrease and will then find a better balance in terms of supply and demand in the future. And thirdly, even in the US we see an increasing trend again for people going back to the offices. When you talk to our colleagues in the US last spring or summer everybody was pretty much convinced, okay, most people would like to spend as less time as possible in the office. Now we see increasing numbers. People are coming back to the offices and not only, because the employer is asking for that, because also people would like to be back in the office. So these are the trends, which needs to stabilize. And then we're going to see a stabilization of the whole market, again, but forecasting when will be the turning point. This is the $64,000 question currently, which I unfortunately can't really answer.\nAnke Reingen: Thank you very much.\nJochen Klösges: Welcome.\nOperator: Last question of today is from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. Just one question. Most of them have been answered. What is the average cost of your new deposits in 2023? Like what kind of rates are you paying for those deposits? Thank you.\nMarc Hess: Well, if you're talking about the BDS deposits, we wouldn't disclose that, because this would finally then, let's say, disclose our total margins and everything. So please -- hope for your understanding that we wouldn't -- when it goes to Raisin, of course, you can see the current prices that we pay on their platform for each and every time band. So I think that's very transparent.\nJochen Klösges: And let me add about the BDS deposits. Of course, we are in a competitive environment. Our customers -- our corporate customers, of course, they know what are the market conditions and we need to manage that. And this is true for each and every bucket of the deposits. So I would say nothing which really differentiates us from other banks everybody here in a more and more increasing environment in terms of clients asking for higher interest margin for deposits. That is something which is I guess in development which is -- which was expected.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right. So but the -- like from what you said this should be comparable to the kind of interest rates you're offering on your platforms currently. I mean, there shouldn't be much huge differences.\nMarc Hess: Well, on the platform it's basically term money. As we stress more than 90% has more than two years. Obviously, when it comes to the BDS deposits, a large part of that more than €5 billion is current accounts. Typically, you don't pay any interest on current accounts. There is overnight money here obviously that is very close to market to short-term rates there is more longer-term accounts. So it's a mixture. Yes, it's a mixture. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Okay. Thank you.\nJochen Klösges : So I guess no further questions. Thanks everybody for attending this conference call. We hope that we answered all your questions. If there are further questions, don't hesitate to call Jürgen and his colleagues. They will come up with follow-up answers. So we wish you all a further good start into this year and thanks for participating. Thank you very much and bye-bye.\nMarc Hess : Thank you. Bye-bye.\nJürgen Junginger: Thank you. Bye.",

Today's agenda will cover the results, the prelim results for 2023 and the outlook for 2024. I'm joined by our CEO, Jochen Klösges; and our CFO, Marc Hess. They will take you through the presentation, which will be followed by a Q&A session. Now I'm pleased to hand over to Jochen. Jochen, the floor is yours.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you very much Jürgen. Good morning, and welcome. Today, we will of course be talking about our company, about figures, markets and trends. And we will certainly also be talking about US property markets in detail, which are currently once again in focus. Now let me first take a look at the political and economic environment in which we operate. 2023 was a difficult year. We have all learned that nothing is certain anymore and nothing can be taken for granted. Neither peace nor freedom are guaranteed. And – so we continue to find ourselves affected by the deep suffering that war has brought upon the Ukrainian people. And in addition last year another war erupted in the Middle East, which shocked us deeply and made the global political situation even more uncertain. All of this affects us during a period, which is challenging from an economic point of view as well. That also applies to the commercial property market, which brings me to our business. There's no doubt that 2023 was a challenging year, especially regarding the performance of the US office property market. You know us, we are used to dealing with these adverse conditions and we have succeeded before in difficult markets. In times like these, it is not German angst, but German's preservance that is needed. We proved this throughout the Corona virus pandemic, when nobody believed in hotels anymore. We carried around €10 billion of hotel exposure through the crisis. And it is these hotels that are helping us now through the cycle because they are contributing to our strong earnings power. The US office property markets have turned down over the last year. Why is that? A combination of working from home, soaring interest rates, and excess capacity, which already existed beforehand, explains this development. We are assuming that the US office markets will continue – continue to experience change for quite some time. However, in the fourth quarter of last year, the markets turned out to be even more challenging than anticipated. As a result, we recognized a loss allowance of some €190 million in the fourth quarter. This will enable us to reduce our NPL portfolio by around €0.5 billion in the first quarter of this year. As I already pointed out in the past, we have been dealing with the challenges and burdens resulting from a downturn in the US office property, since the spring of 2023. We have been working with our clients and partners on resolving every individual case, restructuring exposures and recognizing loss allowances, where appropriate. As we reach the end of this cyclical downturn, will the markets turn around quickly now? Frankly, it doesn't look like it yet. While we have not seen any new NPLs in January to February, we are preparing for more to come just to be on the safe side. This means that even though 2024 will remain challenging, we are prepared in the best possible way. The restructuring we have completed so far plus the €0.5 billion, which we will resolve in the first quarter are evidence of exactly this. The challenges posed by the current market situation are substantial without any question but we can deal with them. Thanks to our significantly increased earnings power, we are able to weather developments, such as those seen last year while showing respectable profitability for the bank at the same time. In fact, our profitability was very close to the previous year's level for the bank. We not only have the financial resources necessary to deal with such a situation as a further strength our bank has an experienced team that has seen such cycles several times before in different markets and has the knowledge and the tools to implement customized solutions for each individual case. Everyone is talking about US offices today, but the problems in this segment overshadow the perception of the entire commercial property finance business. The vast majority of our widely diversified commercial property financing portfolio is stable and healthy. This was also true in 2023. One thing that's particularly important to me is that there are clear differences between the office markets in the US and in Europe. We saw one single new NPL exposure in Europe last year, which needed to be restructured. The case involved a retail property in France and will be settled or is already settled in the first quarter of this year without a substantial loss. As part of the overall picture, we have also used 2023 to invest heavily into Aareon and into the reduction of legacy NPL exposures. We consciously accepted these additional non-recurring charges on our annual results in order to further strengthen the position of Aareal Bank Group. Following these comments, let us now turn to the figures. As you know, our group consists of two parts whose development we have illustrated here on this slide. On the left, the banking business, which comprises of our commercial property financing portfolio and our services to the housing and energy sectors in Germany. On the right, our software business, which comprises all of Aareon's activities, plus, generally speaking, the ERP systems and other digital services for the European property and housing industries. First, the bank. The strong growth in earnings was a very positive factor for the year under review. The aggregate of net interest income and net commission income exceeded €1 billion for the first time, an increase of 31% over 2022. It was thanks to this strong profitability that we were able to offset the provisions arising from the US office market and to afford significant investments. We increased the loan loss of loans to €510 million. This item is largely driven by write-downs on US office property loans, which amounted to €360 million. But it also includes conscious expenditure of €115 million for running down our exposure to Russia and some legacy non-performing loans. Our NPL ratio, which has risen slightly as a result of the new NPLs related to use office property financings, will markedly decrease again as a result of the restructurings I mentioned. By the end of the first quarter of 2024, NPLs will have roughly returned to the prior year's level, that means to 2022 levels. We have continued to keep costs fully under control. Our cost income ratio, which is excellent by comparison with our peers, stands at 32%, which costs stable within the bank. As far as capital is concerned, despite growth and turbulence on the markets, we were even able to slightly increase our CET1 ratio to 19.4%. And despite a substantial loan loss allowance and proactive investments, the bank's 2023 operating profits amounted to €221 million and was close to target and prior year. This is evidence of the bank's strong operating profitability and resilience and a very important aspect, especially in times like these. It also puts our consolidated operating profit of €149 million into perspective. Without the investments of around €100 million in our software subsidiary, Aareon, we would have reached the target corridor notwithstanding the loss allowance for exposures in the US in 2023. So let's take a look at Aareon. We used the last year to make these significant investments into Aareon, as already mentioned, of just under €100 million, a good €60 million more than originally planned at the beginning of the year. We have thus optimized our product range, invested in sales and processes, and have also enhanced efficiency. When you asked me at the 2022 annual press conference two years ago I was not complying with some shareholders demand to spin off or sell Aareon, I said the company was not ready yet. Today, I can tell you that we achieved the targets we had set for Aareon for 2025 already at the end of 2023. The share of recurring revenues compared to total revenues continued to increase last year from 74% to 81% bringing a high degree of stability to the income structure of Aareon. Aareon enjoyed strong organic and inorganic growth since 2021. It has consolidated its structures and expanded its business throughout Europe. In addition to the DACH region, it is in France, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, the U.K. and now also in Spain. On the earnings side, Aareon is also well on track. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a key indicator increased by 33% to €100 million last year reflecting Aareon's strong operating performance at the same time its adjusted EBITDA margin climbed from 25% to 29%. This has enabled us to evolve Aareon into a Rule of 40 company, faster than originally planned. This key performance indicator for software companies means that the sum of Aareon's adjusted EBITDA margin last year 29% and revenue growth last year 12% exceeds 40%. Aareon has now passed this threshold. Moreover, we succeeded in refinancing our subsidiary last year. The facility previously provided by Aareal Bank to Aareon was replaced by external long-term debt and we strengthened Aareon's capitalization via a capital increase in the last year as well. These facts tell us that Aareon is ready for the capital markets sooner than planned. One of the things we want to do in the future is to exploit further growth potential by strengthening the partnership between the bank and Aareon over the long-term. To this end, we have placed the collaboration between Aareal Bank and Aareon on a new footing via First Financial, which is at the heart of a new joint venture between Aareon and Aareal Bank. The Bank and Aareon will benefit from this equal measure. Together we want to offer even better solutions to the housing and commercial property industries in Germany and in Europe, and realize significant efficiency potential for our clients. What does it mean specifically? Firstly, we want to tap into the additional growth potential that Aareon's German client base represents for the Bank's deposit taking business. Secondly, we are exploring opportunities to expand the deposit taking business to Aareon's international clientele. And thirdly, we are investing in First Financial, which provides software and payment services thus creating the basis for Aareon Pay, a new product group for integrated payment solutions within Aareon. By taking the partnership between the bank and Aareon to a new level, we have created an important new approach that will contribute to continued profitable growth for both parts of the group. At the same time, we have established new strategic options for our group. Let me summarize. We made substantial investments in the substance of the group during the financial year under review and shoulders heavy burden in the U.S. Nonetheless thanks to our strong operating performance, we achieved a respectable consolidated operating profit of €149 million. At the same time, we significantly strengthened the bank's operational resilience and further improved Aareon's position. We are as well placed to continue growing profitably. We want to more than double. We want to really more than double our consolidated operating profit to between €300 million and €350 million in 2024 million, and do it in an environment that remains challenging. I would now like to hand over to Marc Hess, who will talk about our financial results for the year and review in more detail. Marc, please.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you, Jochen and good morning to you all from my side as well. As Jochen has already pointed out the Bank and Aareon achieved an impressive operating performance in the past financial year especially driven let's say by the earnings momentum that we have seen and you can see on page 5 an overview of the main indicators. First the bank. I think we can say it was a very difficult market environment. Nevertheless, the Bank generated an operating profit of €221 million. And this is not only close to the original target, but it's also close to the prior year despite the active NPL management that we were pursuing and unbundling charges -- some unbundling charges of Aareon. Over two years, we have more than doubled the pre-provision profit of or to now €731 million. That's up 67% and or €300 million only in last year. And we believe this is clear evidence that we have a significantly improved what we call operating resilience since we launched our new next level strategy back in 2021 early 2021. So on that basis we are also able to slightly increase our CET1 ratio to 19.4% despite of the portfolio growth and of course despite of the market headwinds. When we're looking at the fully loaded figures so -- for fully phased in with an output flow of 72.5%. We would be at 13.4% already. That's also up compared to 2022 by 0.1 percentage points. So we were at 30.3% at the end of 2022. Looking at Aareon, we originally announced investments for 2023 of €35 million. During the year, we even found more opportunities. So we invested €61 million more than originally planned all-in-all €96 million. And therefore we are now ahead of plan and we expect a contribution of €20 million from these investments already in 2024 going on. And therefore the EBITDA which did perform nicely on an adjusted basis last year will even be up this year to €160 million to €170 million in that range. Turning to the next page looking even in more detail at the Bank generating an operating profit of €221 million as I just said. We had additional expenses for restructuring the Aareon third-party debt facility which was originally given by the Bank to Aareon and now financed externally that was another €10 million burden here last year which was obviously unplanned. So if you include that we would even have been at €231 million. This is why I'm saying really not far away from the original plan and also not far away from 2022. And this despite of the really significant risk provisions that we built which I would like to explain. For 2022 they totaled €510 million you know that is including the fair value P&L line always so a little bit more than only shown in the risk provision line. Two-thirds of that obviously applied to the US office loan book. But these provisions enabled us to really actively manage our NPL book and thus significantly reduce the NPLs. One on the legacy side which we announced when we went into the year, here we said we wanted to reuse them. We finally did by €500 million more than we expected. That was also a little bit taking more risk provision than we originally expected. And I think in these times that's even more important we prepared the way for solution of another €500 million non-performing US office loans now in the first quarter of 2024 already. Here we booked another, let's say, €75 million in Q4 to really accelerate this process. So as I just said we want to restructure them we want to reduce the NPLs by €500 million office in the first quarter this year and this is 50% of the total US office NPL book. So we believe a clear market test. Coming to the outlook. We are targeting an operating profit of €250 million to €300 million just for the bank in 2024. Next page shows the Aareon, how did it develop in the recent years? Well, revenues have been rising from as you can see here €269 million in the year 2021 to now €344 million, so dynamic development. Jochen will elaborate on that in more detail later on. And we are expecting as you can see a strong growth to -- well not even to continue -- even to accelerate in 2024. So we are targeting a range of €440 million to €460 million in revenues. That also has of course positive implications on the adjusted EBITDA, which was also performing nicely. So obviously here all the investments that we took are not reflected, it increased by -- from €75 million to €100 million in 2023. And here we expect another increase to €160 million, €170 million range in 2024. As I just said, we had significant investments, which we did in 2023 deliberately. We planned €35 million as you can see in the chart at the end it was €96 million, and that led to a negative EBT or PBT contribution in our segment reporting of minus €72 million but we will have a strong turnaround given that these investments, of course, will not be continued and they will show positive effects. So all-in-all from minus €72 million to plus €50 million in 2024. If we are looking at the summary of the income statement on page 8, we had an original operating profit target of €250 million for the group. This included the €95 million of investments that you can see on the table. And as I said, we invested more in a swift NPL reduction, more in Aareon. So I think this explains the deviation. In total, €221 million spend in 2023. So I think we can really say that we invested into the future basis of this bank heavily. So this is the reported results on the operating side. As I said the momentum remained really strong. And this is why we are targeting an operating profit target of €300 million to €350 million for 2024 as Jochen just explained. And this includes loan loss provisions that are expected to gain above average or I would even say significantly above average, but below what we saw last year with this swift reduction program. So we think we are really prepared to be -- really prepared the best way for 2024. If we are looking back into 2023 and the individual items, you can see here strong momentum in net interest income 39% up. So just under €1 billion, same is true for net commission income. Fees were up 11%. Most of that obviously coming from Aareon. And these are new record levels for the bank. In NII this reflects both segments of the bank I have to say and BDS in the RSF business commercial real estate lending, we had portfolio growth but we also had very good margins. You will hear that here at that later on. And in BDS, our deposit business of course we benefited from the normalized interest rate environment. As I just said fee income mainly driven by Aareon, risk provisions €520 million. This as I've just mentioned includes the €69 million of the fair value P&L line. And as I also said, the significant risk provisions are attributable to the persistent headwinds of course of the US office market, but also to the investments in active reduction of NPLs. So also to mention we are out of Russia. So we sold our Russian exposure last year, which also let's say cost us like €35 million at the end. Admin expenses while the first site here increased by 13% to €645 million as you can see. But this is only attributable to the investments in Aareon. If you're looking at the bank, costs remained mainly stable and the cost/income ratio even improved significantly from 40% to 32%. We had a high tax burden last year. That's a -- I wouldn't say a technical effect, but a result of the takeover, because here in Germany, when you're taken over by another company which we were Atlantic Bidco as you know, you have to write-sdown the deferred tax assets. And that's simply the fact and this is what brings the tax ratio up this year. With that, back to Jochen.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you, Marc. Let's turn to our business lines and start with Structured Property Financing. You see here on the Page 10 with a portfolio size of €32.9 billion, we reached our portfolio target for the past financial year. Average loan-to-value ratios in the existing portfolio remained at a healthy 56%. Our portfolio composition has not changed much, compared to the end of 2022. Hotels remain our largest asset class and Europe, remains our largest region. Germany accounts for only 7% of our total business. And we are no longer involved in China or Russia. And we have only minimal involvement in Property Developments that accounts for less than 1% of our portfolio. However, we do continue to finance buildings that are being renovated, to enhance their energy efficiency. This is evident in our growing green loan portfolio which now stands at €4.8 billion in which we want to grow between €6 billion and €7 billion by 2026. Our total Lending Volume Classified as Green rose to €9 billion now accounting for 28% of our portfolio. On the next page and you see we hit our new business target of €10 million. In doing so, we've grown across all asset classes, but especially in hotels and especially in Western Europe. We also selectively underwriting business in the US, in finance offices and the markets we cover. Although the office market in the US is currently experiencing a significant downturn, offices account for the vast majority of the Global Commercial Property Markets. There are excellent properties that require upgrading to the latest ESG standards in this sector and that's why just under one-third of our total new business was green loans of which, €1.3 billion went into offices, representing around 70% of our new business in office properties. However, the bulk of our business continues to be in Hotel Financing. A good example is the financing of the Le Méridien Étoile in Paris for Henderson Park Capital Partners. This hotel enjoys a prime location opposite the Congress Center just minutes from Champs Élysées and the Arc de Triomphe. We have also grown in new asset classes. Last September, we formed a dedicated team to finance alternative living properties. The objective is to further expand our business in this growth segment which comprises student housing, micro apartments and co-living. We are already one of the leading providers in this sector. And for example, we financed a £380 million portfolio, comprising three student accommodation properties in London last year. The bank has also been active in New Zealand since last year a good complement to our already established market coverage in Australia. This enables us to serve clients who are active in both markets from a single source. And in principle financings in New Zealand are eligible for inclusion and fund lease cover, offering attractive financing options especially for hotels and in the alternative living sector. What is important for all new business is that we continue to assign high priority to conservative risk standards. Loan-to-value ratios for new business averaged 54% in 2023. We also continued to achieve very attractive gross margins averaging approximately 290 basis points clearly exceeding 2022 margins. Let's now take a look at the key indicators in the loan book. The KPIs in our portfolio remain in a healthy range and are better overall than in 2019, the year before the pandemic. Despite the strong headwinds from the US office market, the average loan-to-value ratio of 56% is at a very conservative level. Debt servicing capacity yield on debt, once again improved significantly to 9.6%. Hotels in particular are doing very well with strong cash flows. Thanks to the clear pickup in travel after the pandemic. The retail sector has also recovered faster and more distinctly than many expected. Overall, much of life has returned to normal after the pandemic and we are seeing the effects. At this point, I would like to point out a parallel between retail and office properties. Retail properties had already been declared dead because of the trends towards online shopping. However, we have helped and continue to hold the opinion that the market is changing with differentiating factors, which is – which is why we have continued to finance very well-positioned retail properties. Now the office property markets are changing due to the trend of working from home. And here too new criteria for measuring quality will have to be applied in the future. Of course, location remains the most important differentiating factor but sustainable carbon-efficient properties with flexible space concepts will play an increasingly important role. And this has also been a factor in selecting new business for us in 2023 already. The next slide shows the breakdown of our performing office property finance portfolio by country. The US accounts for the largest share, followed by France, the UK, Poland, Sweden and Belgium. Germany only accounts for 3% or roughly €250 million. In this context, it is notable that average loan-to-value ratios for our office portfolio stand at 70%, whereas in Europe the figure is 55%. This is a clear indication that developments in the US office market have not spilled over to Europe. Why is that the case? Certainly, a different interest rate environment and lower vacancy rates in the European markets. For example, we see in Paris 8%, which is a much lower number compared to certain cities in the US. Also ownership structures differ between the continents. In Europe, this often leads to longer investment horizon. This means that there is a greater willingness in Europe, to repay debt through new equity injections in order to maintain equity positions and keep the properties. And in European real estate financing we see interest rate hedges, additionally commercial real estate in Europe is generally not financed by different layers of that leading to lower LTVs and a very limited market for junior and mass tranches. There are also some so-called soft facts. For example, in the US, it generally takes much longer to get to work from home. People in the US also tend to have larger houses or flats than here in European cities, which makes working from home a lot more attractive from a US perspective. In addition, European cities often offer a better mix of areas where you can live, shop and work at the same time. This means that you may live a little closer to work in European cities compared to in the US and the quality of life in central office locations can be higher in Europe. It is I guess fair to say that overall, we currently see no signs that developments in the US are directly spilling over into Europe. This is due in particular to structural differences between the two markets that I have just described. However, it should be noted that poor properties in poor locations will also face problems in Europe but this is a universal principle in commercial property that has nothing to do with the current market development. On the next page, now let us look further at our US office loan portfolio. A large part of the portfolio is located in New York with the rest mainly spread through other major cities. We concentrate on high-quality Class A properties in A markets. Most of our performing loans have maturities in 2025 or later and only €240 million is due in 2024. The values of all the office properties were reviewed in 2023 and around 80% of these valuations were undertaken externally. We found that a little over half of the market values have decreased by up to 20% since the end of 2022 and that the others were down by between 20% and 55%. These market value decreases are reflected in increase in the average LTV, which is up from 62% at the end of 2022 to 70% for the US office property loan portfolio at the end of 2023. The revised level includes new business with an LTV of 50% and outflows in NPLs. On page 15, we are monitoring -- you see we are monitoring all US office loans closely and have a regular interaction with our borrowers. We expect high-quality buildings in allocations to recover first and this is the category where our loans are focused. Additionally, we expect the level of interest rates in 2024 to take pressure out of the market and help to stabilize values. At the end of 2023, we again stress tested our portfolio for a further 20% decline in value. The stress test showed that the average LTV of our US office portfolio would increase from 70% to 88%. And one correction please, please read on the chart, on the upper part of the chart the LTV of the performing US office portfolio not at 92%, read please 85%. But again, on the basis of the stressed market values, only around €75 million would have an LTV of over 100% and around €260 million would have an LTV in the range of 80% to 100%. The result shows that we have headroom even under very conservative stress conditions. Now, I would now like to expand a little on a topic that is likely to be of interest in view of the current situation, the development of non-performing loans and how we deal with them. We really reviewed our strategy in early 2022 with a view to resolving NPL cases much more quickly than we used to. And more recently, by the way we hired US industry experts to support our team and these are our colleagues with a great experience and track record from large US banks. But again, back to the year 2022 -- at the beginning of 2022, you see that here on the chart, we had a non-performing loan portfolio of totaling €1.6 billion. Some of these NPLs have already been in the portfolio for many years. And then in 2022, we reduced these old NPLs by around €800 million and in 2023 we made a further reduction of €400 million out of that bucket of €1.6 billion. Only a residual balance of €100 million will remain from these legacy exposures by the end of this year of 2024. Then in 2022, new NPL cases totaling €370 million were added, of which we had reduced around already €300 million by the end of 2023. The remainder will be almost completely removed from the NPL portfolio by the end of this year too. Next to the year 2023 NPLs. Developments on the US office property markets combined with other factors required significant NPL additions of around €1 billion on a net basis last year. Some of these cases were solved quickly that same year. The only European exposure of around €100 million will be settled or is already settled without the loss in the first quarter of this year. €150 million in US office NPLs have already been resolved in 2024 and we have in total scheduled around €0.5 billion for solutions in the first quarter of 2024. So, why I'm explaining all this in such detail? Well, it is important for me to convey two messages to you. Firstly, we actively address these situations and have both the people and the resources to work out a variety of solutions with our clients. And secondly, despite all the challenges, it is about really making real progress in the management of non-performing loans. This costs money, but it is an important prerequisite for success throughout the cycle. Please note that, we are on the same page as our owners in this respect. Our investors expressly support the strategy and share the associated short-term consequences for the bank's financial results, for example, in the last year. All-in-all, our NPE ratio in accordance with the EBA's Risk Dashboard definitions was 3.4% at the end of the year, However, given the reduction of NPLs that has already been prepared, we expect the NPL ratio at the end of March 2024 to be back down to end 2022 levels. We will change over to calculating the NPA ratio in accordance with the EBA's definition this quarter, which most of our competitors use establishing a better comparability. On the next page, I would now like to talk about BDS. The average volume of client deposits from the housing industry rose to €13.6 billion, exceeding the target level of around €13 billion set for the last year in 2023. Our solutions are nowadays used to handle the payment transactions of more than 4,000 clients in the housing and commercial property sectors, who between them are managing more than 9 million rental units. The deposit business this generates is granular and very stable given that we are deeply, really deeply integrated in our clients' payment processes. We have had firm routes in the housing industry now for decades, a business we have maintained even in times of low interest rates for our clients. Today, we are benefiting not only in terms of funding, but also on the earnings side. At €238 million, net interest income for this segment was more than 1.5x the previous year's figure. Whilst this increase reflects the normalized interest rate environment, it is also the result of a consistently high volume of deposits, demonstrating strong client loyalty. On average, our clients remain loyal for more than 20 years. But it is not only net interest income that continues to gain traction, net commission income also did well rising to €33 million in the year under review. This business gives us a second, stable and profitable pillar in the bank and, as you all know, things stand better on 2 feet. And now let's turn to Aareon. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, Aareon has seen an outstanding performance over recent years. It continues to grow at an accelerated pace with sales revenues rising 12% and adjusted EBITDA up by 33% and in 2023. I've already discussed Aareon's Capital Markets readiness and the long-term partnership between the bank and Aareon. In terms of business activities, Aareon has further expanded its geographical footprint in Europe by entering the Spanish market in 2023. And Furthermore, during the past financial year, Aareon acquired Embrace, a Dutch provider of CRM solutions and UTS a company for managers of condominium owners associations here in Germany. The M&A credit line previously provided by Aareal Bank, which we refer to as a hunting line has been replaced by Aareon's external long-term debt financing. Even though the change will low double-digit million charge per annum, it shows that Aareon is capable of raising finance on its own, and that's a further important milestone. So Marc will now look at our funding activities and, of course, our capital base and then explain our outlook to you.\nMarc Hess: Yeah. Thank you, Jochen. Turning to page 20, the pie chart here, I think shows very well how diversified our funding structure has become that was one of the major cornerstones of our strategy to really diversify the funding more than originally and thus become more independent from the capital market. And I think we can really say today that we made good progress, of course, as you can see BDS is one major source of our funding. Pfandbriefe are of course still the most important capital market instruments. In total, also can see we've seen here at the chart, we had to tap the capital markets by €2.4 billion last year, significantly less than in the previous year, despite of the growth that what we have seen. And I can also say today, that there is no need to raise any senior preferred funding, at the Capital Markets in 2024 and 2025 and we did not have the capital market here in 2023, as well that was on the private placements the €0.2 billion. To get more independent from the capital market, I think one major element is Raisin. We started the comparison in 2022, we had €600 million deposits at the end of 2022. And this has been grown to € 2.6 billion, just at the end of last year. So, very important. And these are all term deposits, fixed interest and more than 90% have a term of two years and more. So, very reliable source on that end. We even plan to further strengthen our cooperation with Raisin, we are the first German bank to go on their international platform. So, in early February, I think it was the sixth - we started to be on their Dutch platform, and we want to expand that during 2024 even to other European markets. So, I think a very stable situation on that side and this can be reflected if you look on Page 21, you can see the liquidity ratios. They are all well above the minimum regulatory requirements. We have -- as can be seen here considerable buffers in the LCR and the NSFR and these have been kept basically on the same level, despite of the volume growth that we have seen. So, what we also can say, I think it's also important to note here, that the terms of our fundings have longer terms than our property financing. So, the funding terms are around four years while the property finance portfolio has typically, a term of three years. So, very balanced and with the buffer on that side. I think also good news on the capital situation, very solid. Page 23, you can see that we have a CET1 ratio that has been increased over the last couple of years, despite of all the crisis -- that we had to face -- so -- no sorry -- I'm not jumping one page, going back. I'm going back to Page 22. So looking at the Pfandbriefe, as I just mentioned obviously, it's one of our main funding instruments at the capital markets. What you can see here we have a AAA rated Pfandbriefe with the Moody's rating of AAA the cover pool is €16.5 billion diversified over 20 countries. And we have an LTV in this cover pool of 33.5%. So as you know, the Pfandbriefe standards are very conservative and we are of course in line to reach the Moody's rating we are relying on overcapitalization, even on top that's 16.5%, and we even are above that threshold with 19.6%. So also here very comfortable buffers. So now to CET1 capital on Page 23. As I just said, we have been improving that despite of all the crisis that we had to face, be it COVID, be it Russia, be it now the US crisis, and we are now at 19.4%. So despite of portfolio growth, despite of the LTVs coming under pressure on the US offices, we even increased it by 1 -- 0.1 percentage points during 2023. And 19.4% very sound ratios. Also happy to give you the fully phased ratio, with the 17.5% output flow that's 13.4%. So I think also very comfortable also an increase by 0.1 percentage points. And leverage ratio also to be mentioned 6.6% that compares to 6.0% end of 2022. So now, not to get confused again, going to the outlook. I think we can say that the environment will remain challenging from different aspects. The economic development most likely sluggish, inflation persisting, I think there was more optimism in the market at the end of last year. Nevertheless, we will see first interest rate reductions. That's good and bad for our bank. Obviously, we benefit because we do have a diversified business model in our two segments. We benefit from higher interest rates as you have seen in the net interest income of our BDS segment from the deposits of the other -- on the other hand of course higher rates weight on the valuation of commercial real estate, which leads them to higher risk provisions. So all-in-all, we expect first rate cuts by mid of this year as many others do, which I would say has a neutral effect then on us on both sides. If you add it up -- all-in-all with regards to the U.S. office property market, we only expect a little improvement certainly not in the first half of this year, and this is also reflected in our risk provisioning planning. Nevertheless, we are optimistic about the Group's performance in 2024. As you can see here in the bank, we want to continue to grow our credit portfolio, but less than in the previous years. So just by €1 billion that also means less new business is needed €8 billion to €9 billion, which means that we can continue to be very selective here. And we expect stable deposits on the BDS side of around €13 billion. So all-in-all, the bank's operating profit as Jochen already mentioned and me too should increase to €250 million to €300 million despite of the risk provisions, which are projected to remain at above average levels. We mentioned today this morning in the press conference that we expect that we plan for around €350 million of risk provisions for 2023. So significantly below -- for 2024, --sorry -- significantly below 2023 especially the swift NPL reduction for the legacy portfolio, of course, is not necessary. This gives us some relief here. Of course, the markedly increased profitability is one factor why we expect to reach these high levels on a PBT basis. When it comes to -- when it comes to Aareon, we will continue to grow. As I already said, we expect really -- impressive from my point of view increases in the revenues. As I said, the foundation was laid in 2023 and 2023 and the year before EBITDA should of course benefit from that here. In addition, we will benefit from the efficiency measures, so the investments that we did in 2023. And therefore, on a group level EBT, PBT, however, you want to name it, we expect a positive contribution of €50 million for 2024. And that all-in-all leads to our expectation that we can have a pre-tax profit on the group's level of €300 million to €350 million in 2024. So, now I would like to hand back to Jochen for his closing remarks.\nJochen Klösges : Thank you, Marc. Yes, please allow me to summarize in conclusion. Firstly, we finished the 2023 financial year with respectable results, which was characterized by strong growth in income, a high level of investments, and of course, significant challenges from the U.S. office market. Secondly, we have invested in the substance of Aareal Bank Group and further strengthened the foundations for profitable growth both for the bank and for Aareon in the years to come. And thirdly, we are confident that in a still challenging environment we will more than double our consolidated operating profit in the current year. This confident outlook holds a fundamental message. Yes, the current situation is very challenging indeed. But as we have shown this year, we are actively managing these challenges. And since we are pursuing long-term goals, we are continuously working on improving our business models. And we are convinced that the investments of recent years will pay off. Marc and I will be happy now to answer your questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Christian Leukers from CQS. Please go ahead.\nChristian Leukers: Good morning. Thank you. You have a very strong front book margin. So there's obviously a good organic opportunity to sort of grow your book and you've got lots of capital to do that. How would the shareholders or your sort of owners look at inorganic opportunities? Because you did mention M&A for Aareon, but what about for Aareal, because there might be some opportunities in the market there on the M&A side as well. Thank you.\nJochen Klösges: Yes. I must say, it's today way too early to talk about that. Regarding Aareon, we are quite happy with the development we saw in the last year in terms of growth on the sales side, recurring revenues and EBITDA and Marc explained that we are also having very ambitious targets for Aareon in -- for the year '24 and to really execute on the success of Aareon and to see the results of the business basically then delivering on these targets is our clear focus. So it's way too early to talk about M&A. And I guess that's also the view of our shareholders.\nMarc Hess: And with regards to the bank, I think that was your question. We don't believe really that M&A is needed to further develop our business. As you have seen, we can grow organically. Here we very strongly focus on profitability. I think this is reflected in the margins. So on the BDS side, we are I can say so not looking for any M&A opportunity on the RFZ [ph] side. So we are not looking for any M&A opportunities. On the BDS side, so on the deposit side, you have seen very small acquisitions, like we acquired an artificial intelligence company in order to really support our services and our processes that was in the low single-digit million euro area in terms of acquisition price. If we have something here at the market that would really help us to improve our services, we would look at that. But no broader M&A plan.\nChristian Leukers: If I look at your new business outlook in structured property finance, it's slightly lower than the '23 number. Is that -- given the new margin is that -- are you sort of just being conservative? Or could be outperformed there on the new business side? You've got €8 billion, €9 billion.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Yes that's what I just mentioned. It's a little bit lower than last year. Last year, we grew by €2 billion. This year we want to grow by €1 billion. As I said, the focus is very much on profitable growth. So we want to be selective and this is just reflected in these figures.\nChristian Leukers: All right. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Graham Stuart from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nGraham Stuart: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple. You said, you haven't seen any new NPLs year-to-date, but you want to be conservative. Can you talk a little bit about your new NPL inflow assumptions for '24 please? And then secondly, on this disposal of €0.5 billion of US office NPLs at 26% coverage, I mean I guess I've always thought about coverage levels of 50% to get rid of CRE NPLs. So, what comfort can you give me that 25% coverage is really the right level to exit these loans please? Thank you.\nMarc Hess: Hi Stuart. Thank you for your question. I will take the two. The first question -- let's answer the second question first. What comfort can we give you? Well, as we just explained, we want to solve and therefore reduce our NPL on the US office book in the first quarter this year so the first month. And if April is even included whatever so really now actually by €500 million, that's 50%. We are already in the negotiations. We have provisioned them in the fourth quarter and we don't expect additional loan loss provisions for that reduction. So I think that is a market test. And therefore we can say we are confident that our provisioning levels are right. Of course this is a very swift a very quick reduction. So, this is why we took let's say another €75 million on top in risk provisions in Q4 that is for me really an excellent premium. It's like with a car, you have a value of €20,000, if you want to sell it next week, yes, probably you have to accept a little bit lower price. So, this is exactly what we are doing here. And this is why I'm saying I think overall that's a good test. And--\nJochen Klösges: Yes. Yes. And then the other question I guess was about the potential NPL inflow in 2024. And yes this is pretty complicated to give you a forecast about that. You see Marc already elaborated on our overall forecast for 2024. That includes still a pretty high number of NLPs as a budget for 2024 compared to normal is a little bit lower than last year but still a significant number. And you could probably also take away from our explanations that we are still pretty much cautious about the development of the U.S. office market in 2024 and our focus is clearly on restructuring all the single cases together with our clients. When I take a look at our European portfolio including office. So, far I can say you know that also the office markets in Europe are exposed to higher interest rates and to the work from home issues. But so far we saw no negative impact within our portfolio. We mentioned that we had one new NPL in Europe last year and that was a retail property in France, which has already been paid back -- I guess it was yesterday. That was paid back without any substantial losses here on our side yes. So, you see me here knocking on wood and nobody knows exactly what the future will bring. But currently we see clear distinctions between the dynamics in U.S. office markets and European office markets, but we are still cautious and carefully monitoring everything.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. Maybe if I could just go back to your first ask again. I mean you're saying you're going to get to these NPLs already in Q1. I mean we're in almost in March. So, you must have had some pretty detailed conversations. I mean can you just confirm these are professional real estate investors who if there was going to be an allergic reaction to your kind of pricing levels would have you already had that kind of allergic reaction. Just to give me comfort that this isn't something where you're going to come back and say sorry it ends up going nowhere.\nMarc Hess: Yes you can confirm that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nMarc Hess: And again be rest assured when we are now talking about these €0.5 billion talks about that, because that already started I don't know in fall or in late summer or now in last year. So we are in constant conversations with the clients. So this is nothing which can be realized within one weak here. That's what I want to say.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from [indiscernible] from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for the call. A couple of questions from my side. On, Aareon just trying understand how if ever it was supposed it could affect capital would you be able to give us what the current mark of your share of Aareon is currently marked at effectively on a deconsolidated basis the RWAs associated with that? And then also any CET1 goodwill deductions are occurring because specifically of Aareon that would be the first question. The second question when I go through your CRR disclosures the RWA densities. I think I last had on the CRE book close to like 25% that seemed a lot lower than a number of peers. Just wondering could you just help me understand what the reasons behind that are? And as kind of PEs go up and LGDs probably creep up, what are your views on how those RWAs move over the course of 2024 and 2025? And then the third question is just around the BDS deposits. Are there any kind of ratings triggers where any of that will kind of move to other providers or things like that?\nJochen Klösges: Yeah. So let me start with the last question about BDS deposits. We're doing the deposit taking business with our BDS clients here within the bank for decades now. Finally, we are talking about, trying to speak about two types of deposits. One kind of deposits are rental deposits and deposits for the condominium associations here, which is very stable, very granular, small amounts and we basically are able to help our clients to process these deposits in the most efficient way and that's why they are doing the business with us. The other things are the side deposits and they basically represent the working capital of all clients. And that again, we are also pretty deeply involved into their payment processes and that's why we saw and see currently the very stable development of the overall BDS deposits. Then I'm not quite sure whether I understood your first question. I guess Marc will take the question about the RWAs. The first question was about Aareon and potential valuation of Aareon. Is that right?\nUnidentified Analyst: No, just the book value. So above what level effectively do you trigger the P&L gain? And then also there must be on a consolidated basis there would be some CT1 deduction for the goodwill to try and understand what those amounts are? So let's say you removed Aareon on a book value effectively how the capital would change.\nJochen Klösges: So again, Marc will take the question about the RWAs and sorry, we do not disclose the book value of Aareon. We did that not so far, I guess. And yeah, you see the amount of money we finally invested into Aareon in the last, also three years. Secondly, you see the very impressive EBITDA development, I guess in 2021 it was roughly 65, now we're targeting 160. That shows you that we clearly have the target to create a significant amount of value. But please, please forgive me that I am not willing to speculate about a potential value of Aareon not disclose our book value currently. Sorry, yeah?\nMarc Hess: And this, of course, then goes hand in hand with the RWAs. I mean, what I can confirm is how you look at it. Aareon is not consolidated for regulatory purposes. That means that we only have to account for their book value as RWA, but obviously if we now would disclose the RWA, you could recalculate the book value. So sorry for that. Here, we would like to get to give the details. And then I think your last question or it was...\nUnidentified Analyst: It was on the risk entities. They were coming -- when I last saw the CRR disclosures, they were coming in at like 25%. That seemed low versus some fears. I was just trying to understand how that is expected to develop over 2024 and 2025 as PDs and LGDs kind of increase?\nMarc Hess: It's a very difficult, a very bad line, So let me interpret what you said. You said the RWA weighting, yeah?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah, yeah, exactly. The density.\nMarc Hess: The RWA density, that's what you're talking about. You say it's below other competitors?\nUnidentified Analyst: Correct, yeah. And I just want to understand how that would progress as kind of PDs and LGDs went up.\nMarc Hess: Yeah, sure. Well, of course, we are running internal models, so we are on an IRBA model. IRBA, of course, model here, as you can see, we are already taking the higher off, yeah. So we are calculating the standard approach under Basel IV, currently with a 50% output floor. And we are also calculating the revised IRBA and then compare and take the higher off in RWA, so this is the €19.4 million. Well, what is in there? And are they as you say or interpret them comparatively low, because we have high collateralization and we have good values, good LTVs especially. This market development had some impact. You can see that we are up €900 million this year. Of course that reflects the growth of our portfolio. But it also reflects the LTV changes. Of course, we also have given that the Aareon hunting line is now out as said, it's a not consolidated entity from regulator purposes. So it was fully backed with RWAs. Here we had a relief of around €200 million and this was consumed basically by higher charges due to the value development of the total book, which was influenced by US office. But as you have seen before with the LTVs, the LTV of the book only went up by 1%. So don't be surprised that this was hardly a development. For me it's difficult to compare that to others. I don't know what others do and how their models look like. These are our models. And, of course, they are reviewed by the supervisors. If we go to a Basel IV fully view, here you can see we have given full transparency. Commercial real estate obviously is hit most by the introduction of Basel IV and the 72.5% output floor because the collateralization is not taking into account in the way it was before. So here I think that's very comparable then. We are at 13.4% and therefore still I think on comfortable levels.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.\nMarc Hess: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Jérôme Legras from Axiom AI. Please go ahead.\nJérôme Legras: Yeah. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Actually two questions on capital market funding. The first one is you mentioned, no preferred senior needs but possibly non-preferred senior. So happy to hear your thoughts about non-preferred senior benchmark issuance with the current spread environment, which is of course quite challenging? And the second question is on your fund raise bonds, whether you have issues with US office loans, which are in the cover pool if you have to remove them, if you have had to remove some or if there is a risk that you might need some new assets as collateral for the cover pool if the LTVs go above a specific threshold either for regulatory reasons or because of the rating agencies? Thank you.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you very much for your questions. As I just said for liquidity purpose, we don't need to tap the market with a senior preferred issuance. We still would like to do a senior non-preferred issuance this year. So a benchmark size, €500 million. This is to keep the subordination of the Moody's rating. So it only has rating purposes, it doesn't have any liquidity purposes. Therefore, as you said in the current market environment, which is certainly seeing accelerated spreads at very low turnovers and hopefully after the presentation of our set of figures today, they will come back to somewhat normalized levels. But in the current environment that wouldn't be, I think possible or at least not from a commercial point of view interesting. So as I just mentioned, most likely we would tap the market if the conditions are right, is there any plan for the next six months? No there is not. So potentially at the end of the year if the market has normalized then we would look for that senior non-preferred benchmark issuance. What we do regarding the cover pool, of course, we always manage it actively. That means we always take out NPL. So as you have seen we have €1 billion NPLs in US office new in 2023. Presumably some of that was in the cover pool that's always replaced and there is no NPLs in the cover pool, and of course also let's say we have to manage it according to all the other thresholds that have to be matched.\nJérôme Legras: My question was more on performing loans if beyond some kind of LTV threshold on performing most of the offices loan, you have to take them out even if they are not NPLs?\nMarc Hess: To be honest, I have to clarify. So, we would like to come back to you. If you just call our IR partner, he will give you the answer right away. I'm aware of the policy regarding NPLs but we will clarify that.\nJérôme Legras: Okay. Thank you.\nMarc Hess: Of course all the thresholds as I just said have to be met and the LTV on the pool is like 33.\nOperator: The next question is from Jakub Lichwa from TwentyFour. Please go ahead.\nJakub Lichwa: Hi, there. Thanks for holding the call and the Q&A session. So, the first one is actually just on the timing of the sale for the US book. I mean obviously you're indicating Q1, we are nearly in March. Is this something\nJürgen Junginger: Jakub, there's a lot of background noise with you. We can hardly hear you.\nJakub Lichwa: Sorry, can you hear me any better now, just trying to manage.\nJürgen Junginger: Not really. We try, please just try slowly maybe we can chase.\nJakub Lichwa: Okay. So, what is the timing on the sale of the US book?\nMarc Hess: Well, as we said that's time for now for the first quarter. I'm not saying that this may not take until the 15th of April, but we would certainly like to give you a positive message then with our Q1 results. So, it's time for now.\nJakub Lichwa: Okay. What is IPR on the new business at the moment?\nMarc Hess: We will have a look. So let us check that. Maybe we take the next question and we come back to that still during that call.\nOperator: Next question is from Alexei Lougovtsov [ph]. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thank you very much for the results and encouraging guidance. I have a couple of questions. So, on the NPL formation €1 billion of NPLs that were added in the US last year, how did it happen? Were those loans maturing in 2023? Or did they going to nonperforming because of interest payment default and subsequent acceleration? And my second question is about the overall portfolio slide 10. 37% of loans classified as in Western Europe. Could you please provide more color on which countries are in Western Europe on that chart? And also, your exposure to Germany is quite low. Do you view it as a positive or a negative?\nMarc Hess: Yes. Interesting question. I think in these days, we view it as a positive. I think you have all read that the German market is also under pressure. Also important from our side to stress, we are not financing any developments. Here you know that in Germany, there is particular -- stress in particular and we also do not have any signal exposure. So, when it comes to Western Europe, I can just give you the figures. It's Belgium €600 million, it's mainly France €3.7 billion. It's UK €5.3 billion. We have very little in Luxembourg, Netherlands €1.7 billion and then Austria and Switzerland, both €300 billion. So this is how Western Europe is comprised. Germany, as you have seen is then in addition €2.2 billion. So that was total commercial real estate, yes all the object classes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, yes. I understand.\nJochen Klösges: Yes. And regarding your question about the NPL evolution in the US last year, yes, so multiple things can happen that finally alone is qualified as an NPL. It's not really -- the trigger is not really -- is a loan due. It's more about is there an assessment that it's unlikely to pay -- then obviously, if it's 90 days past due, then finally if the client and the property together can't meet our cash flow requirements, meet the debt service cover requirements or in some cases we see then reach of covenants. And so all these events – events are monitored, valued and then negotiated with the clients. and – but there are clear rules when a performing loan has to be reclassified as an NPL and that is always also checked and tested by our auditors and by many involved parties. So I hope that answers your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: It does. Thank you very much. It is very helpful.\nJochen Klösges: Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Fenner-Leitao from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.\nPaul Fenner-Leitao: Hi, team. Thanks very much for the presentation. I've got two kind of add-on questions to ones that have already been asked. On the issuance of NPS, you mentioned a loss given failure specifically. You've got a negative outlook at Moody's. It's been on for a while. Do you think the prospect of the issuance of that bond protect your A3 senior rating? Is that the idea? What are you hearing? What are the latest conversations with Moody's? Or is it a given that that gets downgraded? And could that change if you do get downgraded, before you issue this year? Does that mean that you're less likely to need to issue? Question number one. Question number two, is you've got an AT1 outstanding that you didn't call a couple of years ago, got decent regulatory capital position you're well above your subs, the bond is trading well below par. What are your – can you just update us on your philosophy around the potential call? And what's your appetite for liability management of that bond you could get a decent gain out of it? Thank you.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you for your questions. Well, of course, when it comes to Moody's, these are confidential conversations we have with them. So obviously, I cannot, let's say, talk about the discussions we have with them. Obviously, as I just said, we would like to place a senior non-preferred still this year at the end of this year in order to support the subordination and therefore to keep the up-notching. I think that's somehow independent from the yearly revenue of the rating that will take place, let's say on a regular basis here. As you know, we have a negative outlook now for I think more than two years. On the one hand, obviously the situation on the US office market is difficult, that weights on commercial real estate finances that weighs on us. On the other hand of course, we have today presented from our point of view a decent set of figures. I think we have provisioned comprehensively on the one side. We have certainly shown very good momentum on the revenues. Costs are under control. Liquidity is – has substantial buffers, very solid level of our CET1. And we think this should all be reflected. And hopefully, we can keep our A minus rating here with Moody's. This is certainly what we are working on. With regards on the AT1, what's our philosophy? Well you've seen we have not called them last year. We didn't call them the year before. That was always quite difficult market environments. We are still in a difficult environment. I mean last year remember there was -- exactly at this point in time there was Credit Suisse. There was the US regional banks. The year before Russia just invaded the Ukraine. The year before COVID started so very difficult market environment. This year, well we are still talking about US and you have seen the elevated spreads on AT1. I mean, it's very clear if we call it we have to replace it. So would you, let's say, advisers to do it now? Probably not. We have not taken the decision yet but I think you can read my words here.\nPaul Fenner-Leitao: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Anke Reingen from RBC. Please go ahead. \nAnke Reingen: Yes. Thank you very much for taking my question. Two more simple questions. First is -- with respect to there have been a few articles or comments that the regulators to provide focusing is on commercial real estate. Do you expect that might accelerate potentially on the pace at which you have to take provisions anything on capital requirements or higher risk ratings? Or what could be the implications be given that there seems to be some focus. And then with respect to US commercial real estate, what do you think will sort of like eventually stabilize the market? Or is the oversupply? Or is it rates coming down? Is it just time? Just that would be great if you can maybe just shed some light on your thinking. Thank you very much.\nJochen Klösges: Yes. So let me take these questions. So when you -- when you talk about the regulator you know that we are regulated by ECB [indiscernible] bank and BaFin. And we are in constant talks with them in each and every situation. So this is something which is for us as usual. And obviously when something extraordinary happens then we provide them with extra reports and have conversations that is for us currently -- this is as usual and they are obviously following in the picture about everything that's going on here. So nothing really extraordinary for me to mention today about that. And then, yes, what could stabilize the markets. Again I'd really like to emphasize again, If you're talking about Europe, if we're talking about logistics, if we're talking about hotels, if you're talking about retail that all is stable. As I mentioned, we saw no issues currently within these parts of our portfolio. We're still talking about the US office portfolio. And for me I guess the next important step is that everybody will gain some confidence that we will not see further increasing interest rates that basically we all get a grip on inflation rates and that everybody can then now calculate in a much better and sustainable way what are the key parameters for future investments. That's currently very important. Second point is obviously that we do not currently see any new projects coming to the market that was stopped already in 2022 and which each and every quarter which not provides new property to the market. Finally, supply will decrease and will then find a better balance in terms of supply and demand in the future. And thirdly, even in the US we see an increasing trend again for people going back to the offices. When you talk to our colleagues in the US last spring or summer everybody was pretty much convinced, okay, most people would like to spend as less time as possible in the office. Now we see increasing numbers. People are coming back to the offices and not only, because the employer is asking for that, because also people would like to be back in the office. So these are the trends, which needs to stabilize. And then we're going to see a stabilization of the whole market, again, but forecasting when will be the turning point. This is the $64,000 question currently, which I unfortunately can't really answer.\nAnke Reingen: Thank you very much.\nJochen Klösges: Welcome.\nOperator: Last question of today is from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. Just one question. Most of them have been answered. What is the average cost of your new deposits in 2023? Like what kind of rates are you paying for those deposits? Thank you.\nMarc Hess: Well, if you're talking about the BDS deposits, we wouldn't disclose that, because this would finally then, let's say, disclose our total margins and everything. So please -- hope for your understanding that we wouldn't -- when it goes to Raisin, of course, you can see the current prices that we pay on their platform for each and every time band. So I think that's very transparent.\nJochen Klösges: And let me add about the BDS deposits. Of course, we are in a competitive environment. Our customers -- our corporate customers, of course, they know what are the market conditions and we need to manage that. And this is true for each and every bucket of the deposits. So I would say nothing which really differentiates us from other banks everybody here in a more and more increasing environment in terms of clients asking for higher interest margin for deposits. That is something which is I guess in development which is -- which was expected.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right. So but the -- like from what you said this should be comparable to the kind of interest rates you're offering on your platforms currently. I mean, there shouldn't be much huge differences.\nMarc Hess: Well, on the platform it's basically term money. As we stress more than 90% has more than two years. Obviously, when it comes to the BDS deposits, a large part of that more than €5 billion is current accounts. Typically, you don't pay any interest on current accounts. There is overnight money here obviously that is very close to market to short-term rates there is more longer-term accounts. So it's a mixture. Yes, it's a mixture. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Okay. Thank you.\nJochen Klösges : So I guess no further questions. Thanks everybody for attending this conference call. We hope that we answered all your questions. If there are further questions, don't hesitate to call Jürgen and his colleagues. They will come up with follow-up answers. So we wish you all a further good start into this year and thanks for participating. Thank you very much and bye-bye.\nMarc Hess : Thank you. Bye-bye.\nJürgen Junginger: Thank you. Bye.",

    "fullTranscript": "Jürgen Junginger: Good morning, everybody. I'm pleased to welcome you to today's conference call. And today's agenda will cover our results from the second quarter and the first half of 2023 together with the outlook for the portfolio.  I'm joined by our CEO, Jochen Klösges; our CFO, Marc Hess; and our Chief Market Officer, Christof Winkelmann. They will take you through a presentation. And this will be followed by a question-and-answer session.  And now I'm handing over to Jochen. Please, the floor is yours. \nJochen Klösges: Thank you, Jürgen. Good morning. I would also like to welcome you all to the presentation of our results for the second quarter and the first half of this year. This is a busy day. And in just a few hours, we will also be holding this year's general meeting.  And it's only a few short weeks since the 20th of July when we celebrated the 100th anniversary of our predecessor institutions, Deutsche WohnstättenBank AG. We've been looking back in recent days on the eventful first century for our banks, spanning periods of historic upheaval, several changes of name and numerous notable successes.  On the June 4, Atlantic BidCo successfully completed the voluntary public takeover offer of Aareal and became the owner of approximately 90% of the shares. Atlantic BidCo is indirectly held by funds controlled, managed or advised by Advent International, Centerbridge Partners as well as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and other minority shareholders.  These new investors have committed to supporting our strategic ambitions to strengthen our position as a leading international provider of property financing and to continue development of our software, digital solutions and payment services businesses.  Therefore, we will continue to implement our Aareal Next Level strategy with the support of these investors, pursuing further potential across all three of our business segments, whilst maintaining, of course, our conservative risk policy.  Above all, we're looking ahead together with our new owners with a clear view of opportunities, but also of challenges.  Challenges and opportunities – these words prompt me to talk about the second quarter of this current financial year, upon we which are reporting today.  We're reporting operating profits for the first six months of 2023 that almost matched the result for the first six months of 2022 and confirming our operating profit targets for 2023. This is despite the investment in our business which we described when we reported the full year 2022 results and despite headwinds in the US office market.  A challenging environment in the US had a relatively low impact on our first quarter results, but is visible in the second quarters loan loss provision. However, our strong profitability, which has increased significantly over five years, and the performance of all our other property finance portfolios has helped us to cope with this challenge.  We've been able to manage the headwinds resulting from the current situation on the US office property market in the first six months, and we've been able to invest more than originally planned in our company to support future growth.  Last, but not least, we have ended our exposure in Russia.  All of this shows that our business model is robust. We have once again demonstrated our high operating resilience, even in a difficult environment.  Looking in more detail at the figures we are presenting today. At €87 million, our consolidated operating profit for the first half of 2023 was just a little lower than the previous year's figure. And this despite the considerable strategic investments that I've just mentioned and much higher loss allowance.  So this is despite the investments in Aareon. This is despite the expenses of a swift reduction of legacy exposures in the loan portfolio. This is despite the cost of ending our business in Russia, and a higher loss allowance in the US.  Although we have been facing these happenings, we were able to generate a positive consolidated operating profit of €87 million in the first half of the year, of which €25 million was posted in the second quarter. And this was possible mainly because we have strengthened our operating profitability, and along with that our resilience.  Aareal Bank's net interest income has never been higher in a single quarter than between April and June 2023 And it's never been higher in a half-year period than the first six months of this year.  Net commission income continues to develop favorably, growing at a double-digit rate in the second quarter and the first half of 2023. We are also in a position of financial strength based on a profitable liquidity position and with stable, very solid capitalization. We were able to, once again, slightly increase our CET1 ratio despite the growth in lending volume.  And in the most recent ECB stress test, we achieved an above average result. Marc Hess will elaborate on this later.  Despite increased burdens from the loss allowance for the US office, financings and further investments at Aareon, we are confident that we will meet our forecast for the full year 2023. Consolidated operating profit, however, may come in at the lower end of the communicated range of between €240 million and €280 million.  To sum up, Aareal Bank Group is performing well, both in terms of operations and financial position, and is well prepared for the next phase in its development.  I am now pleased to hand over to Marc who will provide more detailed information on our financial results. Please, Marc?\nMarc Hess : Yeah. Thank you very much, Jochen. And very good morning from my side as well.  Let me continue with an overview of the first six months. Our top line performance remained very dynamic in the first half. Indeed, I think you can see here it on page 4, we showed a great momentum that was driven by net interest income mainly. It is up 40% year-over-year. We are benefiting from rising interest rates as well as from portfolio growth at good margins over the last 12 months and from our broadly diversified funding mix.  Net commission income showed double-digit growth as well, driven by both the BDS segment and by Aareon's performance. The reported increase in costs is attributable almost entirely to M&A in Aareon and the announced efficiency measures as well in Aareon.  Risk provisions reflect the effect of the previously announced investment in a swift NPL reduction, provisions relating to the US office market and the sale of our remaining Russian exposure. I will come back to that in a moment.  Bottom line was nearly stable compared to last year at €87 million euros. Jochen just mentioned that despite of the additional burdens that we had to take.  Continuing on page 2, you can see a more detailed outlook or more detailed look at the – of the developments of the key income components. Indeed, our earnings momentums remained really strong in the first six months and net interest income, as I just said, grew by 40% to €462 million, hitting a record high for Aareal Bank, as did the €240 million in net interest income in the second quarter alone.  One reason behind the strong increase is the profitable growth of our portfolio over recent years, which we were able to continue in the second quarter with good gross margins on new business. We also benefited strongly from the interest rate environment in our deposit taking business. Net interest income from the BDS segment increased significantly to €111 million in the first six months. It is also a remarkable result in absolute terms, I think.  These results evidence the advantages of our diversified business model. While increased interest rates have put property markets under pressure, our BDS segment has benefited. As you can observe the structure of our business model is like a hedge [Technical Difficulty] negative effects of rising rates.  Net commission income continues to develop favorably too. It grew by 13% in the first six months to reach €149 million. Solid sales revenues development at our software business Aareon and growth of net commission income in our BDS segment both contributed.  Jochen has already touched up on it. It's thanks to our much higher profitability, what we call, operative resilience that we are able to absorb multiple headwinds and invest at the same time.  On the next page, I would like to have a closer look into costs and LLPs. First of all, we have increased the announced investment in Aareon efficiency program to approximately €60 million, an amount which we have already absorbed almost completely in the first half. The investments were predominantly related to the combination of Aareon's UK entities and the optimization of the product portfolios. And we will see the benefits already starting in the second half on the cost line. These expenses are the main reason for the increase in admin expenses. I would say the only reason that we have reported in the first half of 2023.  We managed to keep costs stable at the bank, again. Together with the strong growth in income, this leads to a very good cost income ratio of only 32% for the first six months and 30% for the second quarter. You will certainly agree with me that these are excellent figures in absolute and in relative terms.  As already mentioned, we have seen further headwinds in the US office market. Risk provisions increased by 50% in the first six months to €160 million, of which €128 million were recognized in the second quarter. A further €33 million of loss allowances were recognized in the fair value P&L line for those loans held at fair value P&L.  So, total risk provisions, including further NPL, in the second quarter amounted to €161 million or close to €200 million for the first half. At around €100 million, the largest part was attributable to the US office properties. In addition, the €60 million budgeted for a swift reduction of the NPL inventory was fully drawn upon in the second quarter. Of that amount, around €35 million went to the termination of the remaining exposure in Russia.  With the provisions added in the second quarter, we've recognized an extensive loss allowance for all the risks identifiable today. However, if you ask me now, if this is all or if there will be new charges for our US office property portfolio, what I can say is, as of today, we cannot give you a conclusive answer. But we feel well prepared with the extensive risk provisions that we have made. And we will, of course, remain vigilant.  Now let me hand back to Jochen and to Christof for comments on the development of the three segments.\nChristof Winkelmann: Thank you, Marc. And also, a warm welcome from my side. In structured property financing, new business gained traction in the second quarter at roughly €3 billion. New business in the second quarter significantly exceeded the previous quarter and the same quarter of the previous year. New business in total for the first half of 2023 now is totaling €4.1 billion euros.  And we've very much stayed true to committing to be selective and risk aware, meaning we are not growing at all cost, but are in line with our conservative risk standards which we haven't changed throughout the cycles, and that can be seen in the average loan to value at roughly 53% for the loans newly originated in the first half of 2023. So for the €4.1 billion, which is 4 percentage points lower than the first half of 2022.  At around 290 basis points, during the first six months, the average gross margins were well ahead both the previous year and ahead of plan. The plan was 240 basis points to 250 basis points and previous year's comparable figures were at 227 basis points.  I think also a positive to mention is that we were able to further grow our green loan book by a total of €1.4 billion, which is consisting of €900 million of newly originated green loans and €500 million of conversions of existing loans that are fulfilling our very strict green lending parameters.  Jochen?\nJochen Klösges : Thanks, Christof. Let's now turn to the next page and to our second segment, Banking & Digital Solutions. This segment has been performing well too. Marc has already described the significant increase in net interest income for the first half of this year. Here we can see the positive effects of rising interest rates on our deposit taking business.  At the same time, average deposit volumes exceeded our targets of around €13 billion for the first half of the year at €13.5 billion. This was achieved despite increased competition for deposits in the markets.  As expected, we are seeing a shift from demand to term deposits, but we are also seeing term deposits growing steadily, which are usually held over the long term.  Net commission income too increased at BDS in the first half of 2023. It is growing steadily, with an increasing proportion from recurring revenue as set out in our strategy.  And now let's turn to our third business line, our software subsidiary, Aareon, where the growth strategy of recent years is paying off. sales revenues increased significantly by around 15% in the first half of the year. Aareon has also increased the recurring share of total revenue to 76%.  The earning side also looks reassuring. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 22% in the first half of the year to reach €39 million. After the strong growth of recent years, partly driven by acquisitions, Aareon's management placed a strategic focus on measures to enhance efficiency in the first two quarters of this year.  The originally budgeted investment of roughly €35 million was extended to approximately €60 million. The early retirement program announced at our annual press conference in March was completed already ahead of schedule.  Regarding the new partner program, Aareon Connect, which was launched in the first quarter, Aareon was able to expand its circle of partners and to attract the first clients. The program allows clients to integrate third-party software solutions and services with Aareon's systems much more easily. This marks an important step in the deepening of Aareon's client relationships.  And in addition, Aareon is continuing to pursue its acquisition program and announced yesterday the acquisition of IESA. IESA is the leading provider of software solutions for property managers in Spain. With this acquisition, Aareon is expanding its geographical footprint into southern Europe and is enhancing its range of services in the strategically important property management markets. This is Aareon's third recent action in this sector, following UTS in Germany and Twinq in the Netherlands.  And now it's my pleasure to hand over again to Christoph who will provide more detailed information on our loan portfolio. Please, Christof.\nChristof Winkelmann : Thank you, Jochen. This would be on slide number 11. As you can see, overall, portfolio volume has grown to €32.1 billion. And this means that we are already having an interest bearing portfolio for the year and target somewhere between €32 billion to €33 billion.  To mention is that the composition, as you can see, quarter-over-quarter has not changed much over the past six months compared to 2022. We are continuously broadly diversified across regions and our different property types.  As in the past, we are not providing project development, but are providing financings for properties that require innovations to improve the energy efficiency and ESG conformity, which we do some of.  In the same time, our green property portfolio grew to €7.7 billion, as I've mentioned before, and this is including €3 billion total green loans to date.  On page number 12, I think the metrics somewhat speak for themselves. The LTV for the overall book stands at a solid 55%, providing what I would call a comfortable cushion in turbulent times that we are going through at current.  Yield on debt is steadily improving over the last years and averaging 9.5%. Mind you that bespoken hotels and retail portfolio have improved significantly, standing at a 10.9% debt yield for the overall hotel portfolio globally and a 10.7% debt yield for our complete retail portfolio. I think this is a very comfortable position. And it shows that our assets that we signed are able to indeed pay debt service even in an increased interest rate environment.  On page number 13, I think due to maybe situation that we are all in, this is a view on the total US portfolio. If we are looking at the performing US portfolio, it is amounting to €8 billion at a very solid LTV. That is also true for the office properties. There are no exceptions. For 93% of our entire US portfolio, delayed LTV is below 60% and only for 2% it is above the 70% mark.  Also, mind you, whilst those are turbulent times, turbulent times also bring about opportunity. So we are selectively underwriting highly attractive, accredited, and risk encompassing new business also in the US at this point in time, going forward as well.  On page number 14, it's a bit of a deeper dive on only the office portfolio of the US. And we are making no secret that our headwinds in the US when it comes to especially office properties.  We are managing them very closely. This, by the way, does go up all the way to the board. They're involved on most of these cases personally as well, together with our clients to find solutions in this, I would call, challenging times.  We have around 50 US office financing projects concentrating on high quality, grade A properties in class A markets. We're not scattered throughout the Midwest, but in the major MSAs across the US. Therefore, New York represents a bit more than 50% of our total US portfolio. And the rest is largely spread out throughout the major US cities. The overall LTV is at 63% at current.  Also to mind you is that the maturities for the upcoming lease renewals and renewals for the book are very manageable, as you can see on the bottom left graph, with 11% for the year 2023 and only 88% for the year 2024.  Also, just another news that has just come across is that, especially for New York State and New York City, state employees for the largest part have now been ordered back into the office, maybe partly attributable to what I've said beforehand, that we will have a hybrid world, but it doesn't consist simply of home office. There needs to be interaction. And also, mind you that people will get together. And what we have seen currently is that the actual space needs will vary in different markets, but are not half of what they were beforehand, simply because people need to come to the office. And I'll get to that in a bit more detail for the European part.  On slide number 15, we have looked at our US office portfolio in a stress scenario. If we were to take the market data for the US LTVs, we're looking at about 35% market value decline for the US and general. If we were to mirror that to our portfolio, that would equal roughly 20%.  We have taken the stress to the scenario – stressed our portfolio despite only having to be stressed at about 20% or 25%. The LTV would increase at an overall 63% to 83%, with late LTVs above 100% being less than 1%, i.e. €50 million, and the range between €80 million and €100 million would consist of a bit less than 7%, i.e. €300 million.  We have to date check all the values of our US office financings. More than half of that externally and the rest internally. So the values that you're seeing here are what we would say up to date. And as Marc was saying, we can't predict the future, but we are well positioned with the current provisioning, we believe, to weather the storms that may be lying ahead of us still. On slide number 16, I'd like to take you to Europe. Also here, we are located in the major cities when it comes to office.  Looking at the portfolio, we believe we're in good shape to cope with the structural shifts in this asset class. And the structural shift is not much of a surprise. It is that class A properties in good locations benefit only the good times, but also in the bad times with a flight to quality and that less fit assets probably will have a quicker change than expected and need to either have invest or at least change to alternative use.  The LTVs are sound and we see a significant cushion even in its most stressed scenario that assumes an impairment of 25%. So far, across Europe, we have not seen similar difficulties as we have seen in the US. But also here, we are keeping our ears and eyes open. And at the same time also here, we are using opportunities in these markets to underwrite loans that are in excellent locations with excellent sponsorship and excellent risk/reward.  What is essential for us is to stay in the market and remain in close client contact. Just as a number, we have about one-third of the French office portfolio in refurbishments, and I would say more than 95% of our portfolio are not in the greatest city of Paris, but are in the city center of Paris. This is our Parisian – our French office portfolio.  In the UK, we have nine deals in the office segment. Of this, the majority is in London with nearly €600 million. There are differences between Europe and the US when it comes to officers, mind you, that, for example, Sweden has had over 30% home office ratio before COVID came. And surprisingly, it still has 30% home office ratio as of today, indicating that markets are very different. And when I was talking about the Parisian office market where we are located, the majority of the market we are in would have vacancies at or below 2%, indicating there is no vacancy with rental rates achieving all-time historically speaking.  The UK portfolio, as I said, the majority is in the London Metropolitan area. We are focusing on hospitality and, virtually, there's no exposure in the late LTV above 60%. We are focusing on high class hotels in the greater London area.  If we're entertaining logistics, these are usually part of either portfolio across the UK or across Europe. As I've said, one of our USPs is the cross border financing portfolio is highly diversified, highly granular, very good risk/reward for our purposes.  On the residential side, we're focusing on student housing and some build to rent. We think of that as an attractive sector, also in the UK. And with office exposure, as I mentioned, at around €600 million, going forward, we are looking at opportunities also here.  Retail, we are focusing on retail parks, though, we have not underwritten any retail engagement in the recent past.  Mind you again, the LTV on hospitality, that was bespoke for many quarters over the past years is at 53% LTV and the retail at 51%.  With this, I'd like to hand over to Marc with an update on the NPLs.\nMarc Hess : Yeah. Thank you, Christof. Let's turn to page 18 and have a look at the non-performing loans indeed. Despite the increase in NPLs relating to the US office loans in the first half of this year, NPL exposure are over €300 million lower than in the midst of the pandemic.  The NPL ratio stood at 4.1% at the end of June. According to the EBA methodology, our NPL ratio is at 3.2. And the NPE ratio according to EBA would be at 2.8. So you can see that we have the most conservative definition here when we're talking about 4.1.  As described during the presentation of our results for the 2022 year-end in March, we set a budget of €60 million to enable a swift reduction in NPLs in this current year. And the aim is here to further strengthen our resilience. We have fully used this budget, including around €35 million going into the termination of our remaining exposure in Russia. And we have also prepared some other NPLs in southern Europe to be reduced then in the second half of this year. So this is due to follow.  On page 20, you can see our balance sheet and the liquidity ratios. Not much to say about it. So you can see that the LCR is at 225% and the NSFR at 120%. So, both very sound. The treasury portfolio investments are in very liquid, mainly public sector bonds, and we fully hedge them against interest rate risks as we have no significant unrealized losses within our portfolio.  Our funding activities are displayed on page 21. They remain, of course, broadly diversified. We are benefiting from the initiatives that we have undertaken in recent years to attract new investors for our issues and to introduce new funding sources, for example, through our cooperation with Raisin. The retail deposit volume sourced via Raisin and Weltsparen has grown to more than €1.7 billion. For us, this is a big success, since we only commenced activities in this market segment in the middle of last year, so only 12 months ago.  Regarding the capital market funding, our activities focused on the Pfandbriefe. In the first half of this year, most recently in July, we successfully issued a three-year Pfandbriefe of €500 million, which attracted high demand. We can say the highest demand we ever had, with an order book of around €3 billion. So, really six times oversubscribed.  Our capital position can be found on page 23. And it improved further during the first half of 2023. And the CET1 ratio rose slightly compared to the 2022 year-end to reach 19.4% at the end of June.  Positive effects from the dividend retention after the successful PTO closing, and that was able to compensate then the RWA increase that we had from the growth of the portfolio and, of course, also from the macro headwinds.  The leverage ratio also very sound at 6.2%.  And this sound capital position and restructure and also the operating resilience clearly reflected in the ECB stress test. You know they were published only recently. You can find the results on page 24.  We are very pleased with how we did in this year's stress test. You can see in the graphic below on that page left that we really did very well. It shows how we stand compared to other institutes in Germany that also finance commercial real estate. And we are not only above the average of all stressed EBA and ECB banks, we are well above the requirements that apply to us too.  The stress scenario was really severe. It included an approved adjustment of the prices for financial assets and real estate, the significant price adjustment applied to the real estate market that amounted to 30% discount, really reflecting a severe tightening in financing conditions and a weak economic outlook. So as I said, we believe a real harsh assumption. Nevertheless, our CET1 ratio remained comfortably within the 11 to 14 range defined by the ECB.  This brings us to the outlook now. As already mentioned by Jochen, our strong profitability has enabled us to offset the significant challenges that arose in the second quarter.  We are lifting our guidance on net interest income, the principal source of our income, for this year. At the same time, we expect higher risk provisions than originally planned at the beginning of the year. So all in all, this should be somehow leveling out.  Admin expenses should now come in at the upper end of the guided range, given the additional efficiency enhancement measures undertaken at Aareon. The underlying costs are, of course, fully in line with what we predicted at the beginning of the year. So all in all, we can say we remain confident for reaching our consolidated operating profit target. However, as of today, we expect it to reach the lower end of the target range of 240 basis points to 280 basis points due to the additional measures undertaken at Aareon.  And with this, let me hand back to Jochen for his concluding remarks.\nJochen Klösges : Thank you very much, Marc. So, ladies and gentlemen, you see the figures we've just presented to you today mainly demonstrate three things. First, all three business lines of Aareal Bank Group are making very good progress in operating terms and earnings momentum is still very strong.  Second, on this basis, we are not only able to make considerable investments to prepare the bank and the group for the future and further improve its competitiveness, but also to offset the headwind arising from the current challenging market environment and to reach our targets.  And third, we will remain vigilant given the current environment and keep in close touch with our clients in order to prepare for any contingencies. But thanks to our operating profitability and our financial strength, we still have very good reasons to look ahead with confidence.  So thank you very much for your attention. We look forward to hearing and, of course, answering your questions now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. That question is from the line of Johannes Thormann with HSBC.\nJohannes Thormann: Johannes Thormann, HSBC. Some questions on my side. First of all, on the fees, you mentioned that operating costs have a certain M&A element. Can you quantify how much of the fee income growth was from organic business and how much is M&A?  Secondly, on page 7 of the presentations and the nice increase in new business, everybody tells us real estate market transactions are down and nobody can write new business. What has been the underlying focus of your new business? We see strong share of hotel, but also on office, can you probably provide a bit more detail on this, what has been driving this business?  And last, but not least, on page 14 of the presentation of the US office, probably a bit more color. Is there any difference between the regional exposure between New York having half of it and then the rest in the other cities in terms of the NPLs? Or is this – just any lessons learned? Has been one business more difficult?\nMarc Hess: The first one would be a quick answer. Out of the €17 million increase that we have shown in fee income in the first half, €10 million come from inorganic growth in Aareon. Here, I would say it's basically 50%. Why? Because in the €17 million, we also have minus €3 million increased fees for funding measures. So, you threw it out, I would say we have underlying plus €20 million and, therefore, half of it come from inorganic growth.\nJochen Klösges: Let me start with the second questions, I guess. Christof will add something to my comments and then answer the question about the composition of our US office portfolio and regional aspects.  So, you know that always in times like these, which are challenging, of course, are also times of opportunities. I guess, we proved that already during the pandemic that we did not stop doing business. It's obviously a time where we need to consider to be very careful. You can see that with our leverage – our low LTVs are roughly 53% of our new business we did in the first half of this year and the increasing gross margins of roughly 219 basis points we wrote in the first half, I guess, excellent numbers. But, again, of course, we, I guess, mentioned that many times during our presentation, we're, of course, vigilant, we keep our ears and eyes open, like Christof mentioned.  But there are always opportunities. And even in the US, we did, for example, office new business with excellent parameters. And I guess, therefore, this is not an unusual strategy for Aareal Bank and that's also the reason why you see the strong increase in our underlying revenue growth. And of course, it's time to be conservative, which we are. But I would now like to ask Christof to elaborate a bit on that. And to give you some insight about the portfolio, you asked about the regional diversification over there.\nChristof Winkelmann: If we look back at the past three years, there have been different moments where banks have been very active. They have not been active, but been active in certain asset classes, some banks have completely retracted from some asset classes. They have now come back into those asset classes. I think important for our clients is that we are there throughout the cycle.  Real estate is a very cyclical business. And some of our clients make their monies by buying assets in opportune times, maybe as of today, where they think they can get a better price than they might have gotten four or five years ago, and other clients are more active in the years four or five years ago and are not so active at current due to the macroeconomic outlook.  And yes, you're absolutely right. Transaction volume has largely decreased across the globe. It is slowly picking back up. We are seeing first signs of that. And that was my original prediction at the beginning of the year that I think the second half, we'll see some more transactions. Why would you see transactions? By the way, it is, I think – the point of the turning point will be once the view on interest rates gets firm, i.e. interest rates are not increasing anymore – they don't have to decrease yet. But I think the point of the ceiling being reached, that is where transactions will be had because buyers and sellers will come lot closer to each other, being able to plan.  If we look at what we are doing, as I never fail to mention is, we have some mainstream business lines and we have some USPs. As I've mentioned before, cross border transactions in Europe in the logistics space where, nowadays, large sovereign wealth funds, pension funds think it's a good time to acquire large portfolios, and they need the knowhow for structuring such quite difficult structures.  Likewise, on the hospitality space, as I've mentioned before, it's an asset class I've always talked a lot about. We have dedication to it, as you know, [indiscernible] very well to the crisis. And it is still an opportune time for us to invest into hospitality, also today with clients buying new assets. And maybe that differentiates us or gives us a bigger market share and talk about being able to apply these USPS.  And as Jochen has just mentioned, we have also done office transactions in the US. And as I mentioned, these are at current valuations with very long, average weighted lease durations, with excellent sponsorship and absolute top class A tenants and location.  And as I've said beforehand, we are there throughout the cycles for the clients. And also for us, it is a good time to do some business, when others maybe are shying away because it gives us a competitive edge with the in-depth knowhow that we have on real estate.  When it comes to the geographic diversification in the US, as I've mentioned before, 50% plus of the office exposure is in New York. We also have hotels in New York and retail in New York. But so we are having exposure on the California markets, i.e. Los Angeles and San Francisco. And just San Francisco is also a very hard hit market for different reasons maybe than some of the other ones because the tech segment was very big or is very big. And they're slowly coming back to the office, while slower coming back to the office than maybe the financial insurance sector and also the government sector in New York City where, as I've mentioned before, we are seeing some actually first positive signs on leasing momentum, on vacancy rates.  And also mind you that if you were to project outwards, as I've mentioned on the last call in the US, and especially in New York City, there was a very large influx of supply in 2019, 2020 and 2021 that was being greeted by COVID and work from home and maybe also the scare that went along with the crisis. Now there is virtually no construction in the US in the most major markets, also tending to lean to a possible projection. That vacancy rate will decrease because there's simply very little new product coming into the market and the product that came in since 2019 is currently being largely absorbed. Again, here also, flight to quality and, as I've mentioned before, the, by far, majority of our portfolio is Class A and Class A market buildings, which I think are very helpful in the recovery and the first ones to get occupied and to sustain a crisis.\nJohannes Thormann: Probably one little follow-up on the €100 million risk provisions related to US office property you flagged. How is this regional distribution? Do we have 50% New York or more New York?\nChristof Winkelmann: I would say the majority would be New York just simply because of the majority of our office portfolio being in New York. So I would say the majority of that, or at least bigger than 50%, is in New York. And as Jochen had mentioned before, and Marc likewise, we believe that we have taken a very good step in this quarter to make sure that we can weather the storms that might be lying ahead and have accounted for the risks that we can currently see.  And also, quite frankly, Johannes, everybody's looking forward, having a question mark as to what will happen in the future. And as I've said there, the first market reports also coming out for New York, especially also for London, that are saying there's no construction, people need good grade office space, people are coming back to the office, and in parts, quite frankly, are being mandated to come back to the office by the employers, maybe realizing that an 80/20 shift is not the ultimate goal and where we'll end up I don't know. But we see that across the markets. Again, I'm not saying it's all rosy and everything is good as of this point. But we are long term lenders. So we have to anticipate trends. And what we are seeing across the portfolio currently is, again, the first rays of light in a, what I would call, pretty sinister environment. And again, that is something that we need to prepare for because we are in the business for more than just the next six months.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Participant: I have one question. The closing of the takeover, has there been any discussions about a delisting?\nMarc Hess: You know that the Atlantic BidCo disclosed an offer document within that PTO process. And that is a paragraph saying that there might be a delisting, but this is basically condition to market circumstances. So far, we see no new decision or anything about that as of today. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes the Q&A. \nJürgen Junginger: So then, thank you from our side for joining us this morning. As always, the IR team [indiscernible] for your follow-up calls. Sorry if some of the calls could be delayed because we have our AGM coming up.\nJochen Klösges: Yeah. Jürgen, thank you very much. Yeah, I hope we answered all your questions. It's always good in these times to see Christof being part of our team here because he is on a daily basis in talks with our clients and has a really close grip to the markets. And, yeah, feel free to contact Jürgen and his team. If you have further questions, we'll be happy to answer them.  And thanks for participating here today. And hope to see you soon. Thank you very much and have a good day. Bye-bye.",

      "transcript": "Jürgen Junginger: Good morning, everybody. I'm pleased to welcome you to today's conference call. And today's agenda will cover our results from the second quarter and the first half of 2023 together with the outlook for the portfolio.  I'm joined by our CEO, Jochen Klösges; our CFO, Marc Hess; and our Chief Market Officer, Christof Winkelmann. They will take you through a presentation. And this will be followed by a question-and-answer session.  And now I'm handing over to Jochen. Please, the floor is yours. \nJochen Klösges: Thank you, Jürgen. Good morning. I would also like to welcome you all to the presentation of our results for the second quarter and the first half of this year. This is a busy day. And in just a few hours, we will also be holding this year's general meeting.  And it's only a few short weeks since the 20th of July when we celebrated the 100th anniversary of our predecessor institutions, Deutsche WohnstättenBank AG. We've been looking back in recent days on the eventful first century for our banks, spanning periods of historic upheaval, several changes of name and numerous notable successes.  On the June 4, Atlantic BidCo successfully completed the voluntary public takeover offer of Aareal and became the owner of approximately 90% of the shares. Atlantic BidCo is indirectly held by funds controlled, managed or advised by Advent International, Centerbridge Partners as well as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and other minority shareholders.  These new investors have committed to supporting our strategic ambitions to strengthen our position as a leading international provider of property financing and to continue development of our software, digital solutions and payment services businesses.  Therefore, we will continue to implement our Aareal Next Level strategy with the support of these investors, pursuing further potential across all three of our business segments, whilst maintaining, of course, our conservative risk policy.  Above all, we're looking ahead together with our new owners with a clear view of opportunities, but also of challenges.  Challenges and opportunities – these words prompt me to talk about the second quarter of this current financial year, upon we which are reporting today.  We're reporting operating profits for the first six months of 2023 that almost matched the result for the first six months of 2022 and confirming our operating profit targets for 2023. This is despite the investment in our business which we described when we reported the full year 2022 results and despite headwinds in the US office market.  A challenging environment in the US had a relatively low impact on our first quarter results, but is visible in the second quarters loan loss provision. However, our strong profitability, which has increased significantly over five years, and the performance of all our other property finance portfolios has helped us to cope with this challenge.  We've been able to manage the headwinds resulting from the current situation on the US office property market in the first six months, and we've been able to invest more than originally planned in our company to support future growth.  Last, but not least, we have ended our exposure in Russia.  All of this shows that our business model is robust. We have once again demonstrated our high operating resilience, even in a difficult environment.  Looking in more detail at the figures we are presenting today. At €87 million, our consolidated operating profit for the first half of 2023 was just a little lower than the previous year's figure. And this despite the considerable strategic investments that I've just mentioned and much higher loss allowance.  So this is despite the investments in Aareon. This is despite the expenses of a swift reduction of legacy exposures in the loan portfolio. This is despite the cost of ending our business in Russia, and a higher loss allowance in the US.  Although we have been facing these happenings, we were able to generate a positive consolidated operating profit of €87 million in the first half of the year, of which €25 million was posted in the second quarter. And this was possible mainly because we have strengthened our operating profitability, and along with that our resilience.  Aareal Bank's net interest income has never been higher in a single quarter than between April and June 2023 And it's never been higher in a half-year period than the first six months of this year.  Net commission income continues to develop favorably, growing at a double-digit rate in the second quarter and the first half of 2023. We are also in a position of financial strength based on a profitable liquidity position and with stable, very solid capitalization. We were able to, once again, slightly increase our CET1 ratio despite the growth in lending volume.  And in the most recent ECB stress test, we achieved an above average result. Marc Hess will elaborate on this later.  Despite increased burdens from the loss allowance for the US office, financings and further investments at Aareon, we are confident that we will meet our forecast for the full year 2023. Consolidated operating profit, however, may come in at the lower end of the communicated range of between €240 million and €280 million.  To sum up, Aareal Bank Group is performing well, both in terms of operations and financial position, and is well prepared for the next phase in its development.  I am now pleased to hand over to Marc who will provide more detailed information on our financial results. Please, Marc?\nMarc Hess : Yeah. Thank you very much, Jochen. And very good morning from my side as well.  Let me continue with an overview of the first six months. Our top line performance remained very dynamic in the first half. Indeed, I think you can see here it on page 4, we showed a great momentum that was driven by net interest income mainly. It is up 40% year-over-year. We are benefiting from rising interest rates as well as from portfolio growth at good margins over the last 12 months and from our broadly diversified funding mix.  Net commission income showed double-digit growth as well, driven by both the BDS segment and by Aareon's performance. The reported increase in costs is attributable almost entirely to M&A in Aareon and the announced efficiency measures as well in Aareon.  Risk provisions reflect the effect of the previously announced investment in a swift NPL reduction, provisions relating to the US office market and the sale of our remaining Russian exposure. I will come back to that in a moment.  Bottom line was nearly stable compared to last year at €87 million euros. Jochen just mentioned that despite of the additional burdens that we had to take.  Continuing on page 2, you can see a more detailed outlook or more detailed look at the – of the developments of the key income components. Indeed, our earnings momentums remained really strong in the first six months and net interest income, as I just said, grew by 40% to €462 million, hitting a record high for Aareal Bank, as did the €240 million in net interest income in the second quarter alone.  One reason behind the strong increase is the profitable growth of our portfolio over recent years, which we were able to continue in the second quarter with good gross margins on new business. We also benefited strongly from the interest rate environment in our deposit taking business. Net interest income from the BDS segment increased significantly to €111 million in the first six months. It is also a remarkable result in absolute terms, I think.  These results evidence the advantages of our diversified business model. While increased interest rates have put property markets under pressure, our BDS segment has benefited. As you can observe the structure of our business model is like a hedge [Technical Difficulty] negative effects of rising rates.  Net commission income continues to develop favorably too. It grew by 13% in the first six months to reach €149 million. Solid sales revenues development at our software business Aareon and growth of net commission income in our BDS segment both contributed.  Jochen has already touched up on it. It's thanks to our much higher profitability, what we call, operative resilience that we are able to absorb multiple headwinds and invest at the same time.  On the next page, I would like to have a closer look into costs and LLPs. First of all, we have increased the announced investment in Aareon efficiency program to approximately €60 million, an amount which we have already absorbed almost completely in the first half. The investments were predominantly related to the combination of Aareon's UK entities and the optimization of the product portfolios. And we will see the benefits already starting in the second half on the cost line. These expenses are the main reason for the increase in admin expenses. I would say the only reason that we have reported in the first half of 2023.  We managed to keep costs stable at the bank, again. Together with the strong growth in income, this leads to a very good cost income ratio of only 32% for the first six months and 30% for the second quarter. You will certainly agree with me that these are excellent figures in absolute and in relative terms.  As already mentioned, we have seen further headwinds in the US office market. Risk provisions increased by 50% in the first six months to €160 million, of which €128 million were recognized in the second quarter. A further €33 million of loss allowances were recognized in the fair value P&L line for those loans held at fair value P&L.  So, total risk provisions, including further NPL, in the second quarter amounted to €161 million or close to €200 million for the first half. At around €100 million, the largest part was attributable to the US office properties. In addition, the €60 million budgeted for a swift reduction of the NPL inventory was fully drawn upon in the second quarter. Of that amount, around €35 million went to the termination of the remaining exposure in Russia.  With the provisions added in the second quarter, we've recognized an extensive loss allowance for all the risks identifiable today. However, if you ask me now, if this is all or if there will be new charges for our US office property portfolio, what I can say is, as of today, we cannot give you a conclusive answer. But we feel well prepared with the extensive risk provisions that we have made. And we will, of course, remain vigilant.  Now let me hand back to Jochen and to Christof for comments on the development of the three segments.\nChristof Winkelmann: Thank you, Marc. And also, a warm welcome from my side. In structured property financing, new business gained traction in the second quarter at roughly €3 billion. New business in the second quarter significantly exceeded the previous quarter and the same quarter of the previous year. New business in total for the first half of 2023 now is totaling €4.1 billion euros.  And we've very much stayed true to committing to be selective and risk aware, meaning we are not growing at all cost, but are in line with our conservative risk standards which we haven't changed throughout the cycles, and that can be seen in the average loan to value at roughly 53% for the loans newly originated in the first half of 2023. So for the €4.1 billion, which is 4 percentage points lower than the first half of 2022.  At around 290 basis points, during the first six months, the average gross margins were well ahead both the previous year and ahead of plan. The plan was 240 basis points to 250 basis points and previous year's comparable figures were at 227 basis points.  I think also a positive to mention is that we were able to further grow our green loan book by a total of €1.4 billion, which is consisting of €900 million of newly originated green loans and €500 million of conversions of existing loans that are fulfilling our very strict green lending parameters.  Jochen?\nJochen Klösges : Thanks, Christof. Let's now turn to the next page and to our second segment, Banking & Digital Solutions. This segment has been performing well too. Marc has already described the significant increase in net interest income for the first half of this year. Here we can see the positive effects of rising interest rates on our deposit taking business.  At the same time, average deposit volumes exceeded our targets of around €13 billion for the first half of the year at €13.5 billion. This was achieved despite increased competition for deposits in the markets.  As expected, we are seeing a shift from demand to term deposits, but we are also seeing term deposits growing steadily, which are usually held over the long term.  Net commission income too increased at BDS in the first half of 2023. It is growing steadily, with an increasing proportion from recurring revenue as set out in our strategy.  And now let's turn to our third business line, our software subsidiary, Aareon, where the growth strategy of recent years is paying off. sales revenues increased significantly by around 15% in the first half of the year. Aareon has also increased the recurring share of total revenue to 76%.  The earning side also looks reassuring. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 22% in the first half of the year to reach €39 million. After the strong growth of recent years, partly driven by acquisitions, Aareon's management placed a strategic focus on measures to enhance efficiency in the first two quarters of this year.  The originally budgeted investment of roughly €35 million was extended to approximately €60 million. The early retirement program announced at our annual press conference in March was completed already ahead of schedule.  Regarding the new partner program, Aareon Connect, which was launched in the first quarter, Aareon was able to expand its circle of partners and to attract the first clients. The program allows clients to integrate third-party software solutions and services with Aareon's systems much more easily. This marks an important step in the deepening of Aareon's client relationships.  And in addition, Aareon is continuing to pursue its acquisition program and announced yesterday the acquisition of IESA. IESA is the leading provider of software solutions for property managers in Spain. With this acquisition, Aareon is expanding its geographical footprint into southern Europe and is enhancing its range of services in the strategically important property management markets. This is Aareon's third recent action in this sector, following UTS in Germany and Twinq in the Netherlands.  And now it's my pleasure to hand over again to Christoph who will provide more detailed information on our loan portfolio. Please, Christof.\nChristof Winkelmann : Thank you, Jochen. This would be on slide number 11. As you can see, overall, portfolio volume has grown to €32.1 billion. And this means that we are already having an interest bearing portfolio for the year and target somewhere between €32 billion to €33 billion.  To mention is that the composition, as you can see, quarter-over-quarter has not changed much over the past six months compared to 2022. We are continuously broadly diversified across regions and our different property types.  As in the past, we are not providing project development, but are providing financings for properties that require innovations to improve the energy efficiency and ESG conformity, which we do some of.  In the same time, our green property portfolio grew to €7.7 billion, as I've mentioned before, and this is including €3 billion total green loans to date.  On page number 12, I think the metrics somewhat speak for themselves. The LTV for the overall book stands at a solid 55%, providing what I would call a comfortable cushion in turbulent times that we are going through at current.  Yield on debt is steadily improving over the last years and averaging 9.5%. Mind you that bespoken hotels and retail portfolio have improved significantly, standing at a 10.9% debt yield for the overall hotel portfolio globally and a 10.7% debt yield for our complete retail portfolio. I think this is a very comfortable position. And it shows that our assets that we signed are able to indeed pay debt service even in an increased interest rate environment.  On page number 13, I think due to maybe situation that we are all in, this is a view on the total US portfolio. If we are looking at the performing US portfolio, it is amounting to €8 billion at a very solid LTV. That is also true for the office properties. There are no exceptions. For 93% of our entire US portfolio, delayed LTV is below 60% and only for 2% it is above the 70% mark.  Also, mind you, whilst those are turbulent times, turbulent times also bring about opportunity. So we are selectively underwriting highly attractive, accredited, and risk encompassing new business also in the US at this point in time, going forward as well.  On page number 14, it's a bit of a deeper dive on only the office portfolio of the US. And we are making no secret that our headwinds in the US when it comes to especially office properties.  We are managing them very closely. This, by the way, does go up all the way to the board. They're involved on most of these cases personally as well, together with our clients to find solutions in this, I would call, challenging times.  We have around 50 US office financing projects concentrating on high quality, grade A properties in class A markets. We're not scattered throughout the Midwest, but in the major MSAs across the US. Therefore, New York represents a bit more than 50% of our total US portfolio. And the rest is largely spread out throughout the major US cities. The overall LTV is at 63% at current.  Also to mind you is that the maturities for the upcoming lease renewals and renewals for the book are very manageable, as you can see on the bottom left graph, with 11% for the year 2023 and only 88% for the year 2024.  Also, just another news that has just come across is that, especially for New York State and New York City, state employees for the largest part have now been ordered back into the office, maybe partly attributable to what I've said beforehand, that we will have a hybrid world, but it doesn't consist simply of home office. There needs to be interaction. And also, mind you that people will get together. And what we have seen currently is that the actual space needs will vary in different markets, but are not half of what they were beforehand, simply because people need to come to the office. And I'll get to that in a bit more detail for the European part.  On slide number 15, we have looked at our US office portfolio in a stress scenario. If we were to take the market data for the US LTVs, we're looking at about 35% market value decline for the US and general. If we were to mirror that to our portfolio, that would equal roughly 20%.  We have taken the stress to the scenario – stressed our portfolio despite only having to be stressed at about 20% or 25%. The LTV would increase at an overall 63% to 83%, with late LTVs above 100% being less than 1%, i.e. €50 million, and the range between €80 million and €100 million would consist of a bit less than 7%, i.e. €300 million.  We have to date check all the values of our US office financings. More than half of that externally and the rest internally. So the values that you're seeing here are what we would say up to date. And as Marc was saying, we can't predict the future, but we are well positioned with the current provisioning, we believe, to weather the storms that may be lying ahead of us still. On slide number 16, I'd like to take you to Europe. Also here, we are located in the major cities when it comes to office.  Looking at the portfolio, we believe we're in good shape to cope with the structural shifts in this asset class. And the structural shift is not much of a surprise. It is that class A properties in good locations benefit only the good times, but also in the bad times with a flight to quality and that less fit assets probably will have a quicker change than expected and need to either have invest or at least change to alternative use.  The LTVs are sound and we see a significant cushion even in its most stressed scenario that assumes an impairment of 25%. So far, across Europe, we have not seen similar difficulties as we have seen in the US. But also here, we are keeping our ears and eyes open. And at the same time also here, we are using opportunities in these markets to underwrite loans that are in excellent locations with excellent sponsorship and excellent risk/reward.  What is essential for us is to stay in the market and remain in close client contact. Just as a number, we have about one-third of the French office portfolio in refurbishments, and I would say more than 95% of our portfolio are not in the greatest city of Paris, but are in the city center of Paris. This is our Parisian – our French office portfolio.  In the UK, we have nine deals in the office segment. Of this, the majority is in London with nearly €600 million. There are differences between Europe and the US when it comes to officers, mind you, that, for example, Sweden has had over 30% home office ratio before COVID came. And surprisingly, it still has 30% home office ratio as of today, indicating that markets are very different. And when I was talking about the Parisian office market where we are located, the majority of the market we are in would have vacancies at or below 2%, indicating there is no vacancy with rental rates achieving all-time historically speaking.  The UK portfolio, as I said, the majority is in the London Metropolitan area. We are focusing on hospitality and, virtually, there's no exposure in the late LTV above 60%. We are focusing on high class hotels in the greater London area.  If we're entertaining logistics, these are usually part of either portfolio across the UK or across Europe. As I've said, one of our USPs is the cross border financing portfolio is highly diversified, highly granular, very good risk/reward for our purposes.  On the residential side, we're focusing on student housing and some build to rent. We think of that as an attractive sector, also in the UK. And with office exposure, as I mentioned, at around €600 million, going forward, we are looking at opportunities also here.  Retail, we are focusing on retail parks, though, we have not underwritten any retail engagement in the recent past.  Mind you again, the LTV on hospitality, that was bespoke for many quarters over the past years is at 53% LTV and the retail at 51%.  With this, I'd like to hand over to Marc with an update on the NPLs.\nMarc Hess : Yeah. Thank you, Christof. Let's turn to page 18 and have a look at the non-performing loans indeed. Despite the increase in NPLs relating to the US office loans in the first half of this year, NPL exposure are over €300 million lower than in the midst of the pandemic.  The NPL ratio stood at 4.1% at the end of June. According to the EBA methodology, our NPL ratio is at 3.2. And the NPE ratio according to EBA would be at 2.8. So you can see that we have the most conservative definition here when we're talking about 4.1.  As described during the presentation of our results for the 2022 year-end in March, we set a budget of €60 million to enable a swift reduction in NPLs in this current year. And the aim is here to further strengthen our resilience. We have fully used this budget, including around €35 million going into the termination of our remaining exposure in Russia. And we have also prepared some other NPLs in southern Europe to be reduced then in the second half of this year. So this is due to follow.  On page 20, you can see our balance sheet and the liquidity ratios. Not much to say about it. So you can see that the LCR is at 225% and the NSFR at 120%. So, both very sound. The treasury portfolio investments are in very liquid, mainly public sector bonds, and we fully hedge them against interest rate risks as we have no significant unrealized losses within our portfolio.  Our funding activities are displayed on page 21. They remain, of course, broadly diversified. We are benefiting from the initiatives that we have undertaken in recent years to attract new investors for our issues and to introduce new funding sources, for example, through our cooperation with Raisin. The retail deposit volume sourced via Raisin and Weltsparen has grown to more than €1.7 billion. For us, this is a big success, since we only commenced activities in this market segment in the middle of last year, so only 12 months ago.  Regarding the capital market funding, our activities focused on the Pfandbriefe. In the first half of this year, most recently in July, we successfully issued a three-year Pfandbriefe of €500 million, which attracted high demand. We can say the highest demand we ever had, with an order book of around €3 billion. So, really six times oversubscribed.  Our capital position can be found on page 23. And it improved further during the first half of 2023. And the CET1 ratio rose slightly compared to the 2022 year-end to reach 19.4% at the end of June.  Positive effects from the dividend retention after the successful PTO closing, and that was able to compensate then the RWA increase that we had from the growth of the portfolio and, of course, also from the macro headwinds.  The leverage ratio also very sound at 6.2%.  And this sound capital position and restructure and also the operating resilience clearly reflected in the ECB stress test. You know they were published only recently. You can find the results on page 24.  We are very pleased with how we did in this year's stress test. You can see in the graphic below on that page left that we really did very well. It shows how we stand compared to other institutes in Germany that also finance commercial real estate. And we are not only above the average of all stressed EBA and ECB banks, we are well above the requirements that apply to us too.  The stress scenario was really severe. It included an approved adjustment of the prices for financial assets and real estate, the significant price adjustment applied to the real estate market that amounted to 30% discount, really reflecting a severe tightening in financing conditions and a weak economic outlook. So as I said, we believe a real harsh assumption. Nevertheless, our CET1 ratio remained comfortably within the 11 to 14 range defined by the ECB.  This brings us to the outlook now. As already mentioned by Jochen, our strong profitability has enabled us to offset the significant challenges that arose in the second quarter.  We are lifting our guidance on net interest income, the principal source of our income, for this year. At the same time, we expect higher risk provisions than originally planned at the beginning of the year. So all in all, this should be somehow leveling out.  Admin expenses should now come in at the upper end of the guided range, given the additional efficiency enhancement measures undertaken at Aareon. The underlying costs are, of course, fully in line with what we predicted at the beginning of the year. So all in all, we can say we remain confident for reaching our consolidated operating profit target. However, as of today, we expect it to reach the lower end of the target range of 240 basis points to 280 basis points due to the additional measures undertaken at Aareon.  And with this, let me hand back to Jochen for his concluding remarks.\nJochen Klösges : Thank you very much, Marc. So, ladies and gentlemen, you see the figures we've just presented to you today mainly demonstrate three things. First, all three business lines of Aareal Bank Group are making very good progress in operating terms and earnings momentum is still very strong.  Second, on this basis, we are not only able to make considerable investments to prepare the bank and the group for the future and further improve its competitiveness, but also to offset the headwind arising from the current challenging market environment and to reach our targets.  And third, we will remain vigilant given the current environment and keep in close touch with our clients in order to prepare for any contingencies. But thanks to our operating profitability and our financial strength, we still have very good reasons to look ahead with confidence.  So thank you very much for your attention. We look forward to hearing and, of course, answering your questions now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. That question is from the line of Johannes Thormann with HSBC.\nJohannes Thormann: Johannes Thormann, HSBC. Some questions on my side. First of all, on the fees, you mentioned that operating costs have a certain M&A element. Can you quantify how much of the fee income growth was from organic business and how much is M&A?  Secondly, on page 7 of the presentations and the nice increase in new business, everybody tells us real estate market transactions are down and nobody can write new business. What has been the underlying focus of your new business? We see strong share of hotel, but also on office, can you probably provide a bit more detail on this, what has been driving this business?  And last, but not least, on page 14 of the presentation of the US office, probably a bit more color. Is there any difference between the regional exposure between New York having half of it and then the rest in the other cities in terms of the NPLs? Or is this – just any lessons learned? Has been one business more difficult?\nMarc Hess: The first one would be a quick answer. Out of the €17 million increase that we have shown in fee income in the first half, €10 million come from inorganic growth in Aareon. Here, I would say it's basically 50%. Why? Because in the €17 million, we also have minus €3 million increased fees for funding measures. So, you threw it out, I would say we have underlying plus €20 million and, therefore, half of it come from inorganic growth.\nJochen Klösges: Let me start with the second questions, I guess. Christof will add something to my comments and then answer the question about the composition of our US office portfolio and regional aspects.  So, you know that always in times like these, which are challenging, of course, are also times of opportunities. I guess, we proved that already during the pandemic that we did not stop doing business. It's obviously a time where we need to consider to be very careful. You can see that with our leverage – our low LTVs are roughly 53% of our new business we did in the first half of this year and the increasing gross margins of roughly 219 basis points we wrote in the first half, I guess, excellent numbers. But, again, of course, we, I guess, mentioned that many times during our presentation, we're, of course, vigilant, we keep our ears and eyes open, like Christof mentioned.  But there are always opportunities. And even in the US, we did, for example, office new business with excellent parameters. And I guess, therefore, this is not an unusual strategy for Aareal Bank and that's also the reason why you see the strong increase in our underlying revenue growth. And of course, it's time to be conservative, which we are. But I would now like to ask Christof to elaborate a bit on that. And to give you some insight about the portfolio, you asked about the regional diversification over there.\nChristof Winkelmann: If we look back at the past three years, there have been different moments where banks have been very active. They have not been active, but been active in certain asset classes, some banks have completely retracted from some asset classes. They have now come back into those asset classes. I think important for our clients is that we are there throughout the cycle.  Real estate is a very cyclical business. And some of our clients make their monies by buying assets in opportune times, maybe as of today, where they think they can get a better price than they might have gotten four or five years ago, and other clients are more active in the years four or five years ago and are not so active at current due to the macroeconomic outlook.  And yes, you're absolutely right. Transaction volume has largely decreased across the globe. It is slowly picking back up. We are seeing first signs of that. And that was my original prediction at the beginning of the year that I think the second half, we'll see some more transactions. Why would you see transactions? By the way, it is, I think – the point of the turning point will be once the view on interest rates gets firm, i.e. interest rates are not increasing anymore – they don't have to decrease yet. But I think the point of the ceiling being reached, that is where transactions will be had because buyers and sellers will come lot closer to each other, being able to plan.  If we look at what we are doing, as I never fail to mention is, we have some mainstream business lines and we have some USPs. As I've mentioned before, cross border transactions in Europe in the logistics space where, nowadays, large sovereign wealth funds, pension funds think it's a good time to acquire large portfolios, and they need the knowhow for structuring such quite difficult structures.  Likewise, on the hospitality space, as I've mentioned before, it's an asset class I've always talked a lot about. We have dedication to it, as you know, [indiscernible] very well to the crisis. And it is still an opportune time for us to invest into hospitality, also today with clients buying new assets. And maybe that differentiates us or gives us a bigger market share and talk about being able to apply these USPS.  And as Jochen has just mentioned, we have also done office transactions in the US. And as I mentioned, these are at current valuations with very long, average weighted lease durations, with excellent sponsorship and absolute top class A tenants and location.  And as I've said beforehand, we are there throughout the cycles for the clients. And also for us, it is a good time to do some business, when others maybe are shying away because it gives us a competitive edge with the in-depth knowhow that we have on real estate.  When it comes to the geographic diversification in the US, as I've mentioned before, 50% plus of the office exposure is in New York. We also have hotels in New York and retail in New York. But so we are having exposure on the California markets, i.e. Los Angeles and San Francisco. And just San Francisco is also a very hard hit market for different reasons maybe than some of the other ones because the tech segment was very big or is very big. And they're slowly coming back to the office, while slower coming back to the office than maybe the financial insurance sector and also the government sector in New York City where, as I've mentioned before, we are seeing some actually first positive signs on leasing momentum, on vacancy rates.  And also mind you that if you were to project outwards, as I've mentioned on the last call in the US, and especially in New York City, there was a very large influx of supply in 2019, 2020 and 2021 that was being greeted by COVID and work from home and maybe also the scare that went along with the crisis. Now there is virtually no construction in the US in the most major markets, also tending to lean to a possible projection. That vacancy rate will decrease because there's simply very little new product coming into the market and the product that came in since 2019 is currently being largely absorbed. Again, here also, flight to quality and, as I've mentioned before, the, by far, majority of our portfolio is Class A and Class A market buildings, which I think are very helpful in the recovery and the first ones to get occupied and to sustain a crisis.\nJohannes Thormann: Probably one little follow-up on the €100 million risk provisions related to US office property you flagged. How is this regional distribution? Do we have 50% New York or more New York?\nChristof Winkelmann: I would say the majority would be New York just simply because of the majority of our office portfolio being in New York. So I would say the majority of that, or at least bigger than 50%, is in New York. And as Jochen had mentioned before, and Marc likewise, we believe that we have taken a very good step in this quarter to make sure that we can weather the storms that might be lying ahead and have accounted for the risks that we can currently see.  And also, quite frankly, Johannes, everybody's looking forward, having a question mark as to what will happen in the future. And as I've said there, the first market reports also coming out for New York, especially also for London, that are saying there's no construction, people need good grade office space, people are coming back to the office, and in parts, quite frankly, are being mandated to come back to the office by the employers, maybe realizing that an 80/20 shift is not the ultimate goal and where we'll end up I don't know. But we see that across the markets. Again, I'm not saying it's all rosy and everything is good as of this point. But we are long term lenders. So we have to anticipate trends. And what we are seeing across the portfolio currently is, again, the first rays of light in a, what I would call, pretty sinister environment. And again, that is something that we need to prepare for because we are in the business for more than just the next six months.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Participant: I have one question. The closing of the takeover, has there been any discussions about a delisting?\nMarc Hess: You know that the Atlantic BidCo disclosed an offer document within that PTO process. And that is a paragraph saying that there might be a delisting, but this is basically condition to market circumstances. So far, we see no new decision or anything about that as of today. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes the Q&A. \nJürgen Junginger: So then, thank you from our side for joining us this morning. As always, the IR team [indiscernible] for your follow-up calls. Sorry if some of the calls could be delayed because we have our AGM coming up.\nJochen Klösges: Yeah. Jürgen, thank you very much. Yeah, I hope we answered all your questions. It's always good in these times to see Christof being part of our team here because he is on a daily basis in talks with our clients and has a really close grip to the markets. And, yeah, feel free to contact Jürgen and his team. If you have further questions, we'll be happy to answer them.  And thanks for participating here today. And hope to see you soon. Thank you very much and have a good day. Bye-bye.",

It is my pleasure, and I would now like to turn the conference over to Jurgen Junginger, Head of IR. Please go ahead.\nJurgen Junginger: Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our conference call. Today, the agenda covers our results of the first quarter and the 2023 outlook and some additional information on our lending portfolio. I'm joined by our CEO, Jochen Klosges; our CFO, Marc Hess; and our Chief Market Officer, Christof Winkelmann. Jochen, Marc, and Christof will lead you through the presentation, and this will be followed by a Q&A session. Now I'm pleased to hand over to Jochen. Thank you.\nJochen Klosges: Jurgen, thank you very much. Good morning, everybody, and a warm welcome to the presentation of our results for the first quarter of 2023. It's been just over 2 months since we all have met. A lot has happened during this period. Regional banks in the U.S. [indiscernible] and 2 major Swiss banks merged into one. Markets were highly nervous at times and credit spreads for many institutions widened significantly. And there is once again a particular focus on property markets, which are now experiencing a correction after a decade of continuously rising prices. In this context, we have been seeing a more challenging environment for our U.S. office property finance portfolio since last summer. And consequently, we have been working with our clients on finding individual solutions and plans. We report on a quarter in which Aareal Group has once again performed very well indeed. Today we are talking about a quarter with good results and sound [indiscernible]. We have doubled operating profit compared to the first quarter of the '22 year. Once again, the key driver was on the income side. Our strategy, including growth initiatives, have paid off. Moreover, we were able to benefit from higher interest rates. We are also reporting a model that was announced and the volume of nonperforming loans has increased slightly. We remain very historically financed with our capital ratios for those reasons. Today, on the back of our good start into the year, we are confirming our full year outlook, which we presented in early March. Aareal Bank is capable of leading with turbulences and challenging market faces, something we've proved in coping with the coronavirus crisis to name just one example. Back then, you'll remember, 90% of the hotels we had financed were temporarily closed. And yet today, there is not a single nonperforming hotel closure in our portfolio. We are close to our clients and with our expertise, we anticipated and [indiscernible] the market development, which we're currently seeing in the U.S. In fact, we have been preparing for some time now. We are taking a selective, that is risk aware stance vis-a-vis new business. We are provisioning cautiously and our funding is well diversified. We regularly perform stress tests on our portfolios and consider different crisis scenarios. At the same time, Aareal Bank Group benefits from its second lineup. While rising interest rates are pressure in property valuations, higher interest rates are generally good yields for our deposit-taking business. Moreover, our software subsidiary, Aareon, is growing, which translates into higher net commission income. We continue to invest significant time and money there to further improve Aareon's position for the future. I will come back to this later. Before looking at the first quarter results in detail, I would like to comment on topics that you are likely to find just as interesting as of first quarter results. So what is the statements of the takeover by financial investors. So I will put it that way, we are currently on the home stretch. On April 11, the investors [indiscernible] that they have now also been given clearance by the monetary authority of Central Bank and Financial Markets Regulator. And yesterday approval was received from the German Banking Association for the deposit protection fund. This means that the approval by the European Central Bank is the only required regulatory clearance outstanding now. The investors are confident that they will obtain this highly long-stop date, which is the 24th of May. And now I would like to hand over to Marc, who will provide some more detailed information on our financials. Please, Marc.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you very much, Jochen, and good morning from my side as well. Let me start with an overview of the first quarter. We completed the quarter with an operating profit of EUR 62 million, as Jochen just mentioned, and that is double the figure of the same quarter in the previous year. The income side was the main driver here with net interest income up by 40% year-on-year. We are benefiting from rising interest rates as well as from portfolio growth over the last 12 months and from our broadly diversified funding mix. Yet commission income showed double-digit growth, too, driven by both the Banking and Digital Solutions segment and by Aareal's performance. The reported increase in admin expenses is attributable almost entirely to M&A and the announced efficiency measures at Aareal. The low level of risk provisions is also noteworthy, even more so since management overlay for U.S. office loans accounts for 2/3 of the reported figure of EUR 32 million. I will come back to that later. On the next slide, we take a more detailed look at the development of the key income components. With net interest income of EUR 222 million, we achieved the highest quarterly figure since becoming a public company back in 2002. This was driven by a combination of portfolio growth, good margins, thoroughly diversified funding along with the positive effects of the interest rate environment in our payment deposit business. Increase in net commission income to EUR 72 million was largely attributable to growth of Aareon with the share of recurring revenue steadily rising, reflecting the ongoing transition income in license-based model to a Software as a Service based model. In the Banking and Digital Solutions segment, we are also growing and substantially increasing net commission income. Overall, the [indiscernible] upward trend in income generation demonstrates that our strategy is paying good, as expected. And I can tell you, we are really satisfied with that performance. Turning to admin expenses. On the next slide, I would like to emphasize that cost control remains a top priority for us. Despite inflation, costs in the bank have increased only slightly because income ratio is at an outstanding 45% and thus markedly below our original target of around 44%. The reported increase in group admin expenses was due, on the one hand, to the investment in efficiency measures at Aareon, as already mentioned, and to acquisitions on the other hand there as well. When looking at costs, it's also worth noting that as usual for the first quarter of the year, they are inflated by the banking level that we booked fully the full EUR 25 million in Q1 as usual. The bank revenue is not included in the 35% of income ratio I mentioned, this is in line with the industry practice. So let me now turn to risk provisioning. As of today, we are hardly affected by the much discussed headwinds in the U.S. commercial property markets. What we do see, however, is some pressure on our property values, which we had anticipated. Accordingly, we have booked the management overlay of EUR 21 million. This reflects a conservative 20% markdown of the market values of our U.S. office portfolio. With this, I would like to hand back to Jochen and to Christof for further details on our 3 segments.\nChristof Winkelmann: Yes. Thank you, Marc. New business in the Structured Property Financing segment was in line with the somewhat lower transaction volumes that we have seen across our property markets. We were able to originate around EUR 1 billion of new business consisting of EUR 600 million of newly acquired business, around EUR 500 million of renewals. This is also a result of our continuing selective approach and be as risk aware as we always are and have been. Well, we have taken on the books to year-to-date is of very high quality and truly offered above-average margins also compared to our existing book and to market standards. The average LTV of this newly acquired business stands at 53%, mind you, same quarter last year where new business was at 57%, and the year prior at 61%. So we do see a decrease in the LTVs playing our conservative way of doing new business. And at the same time, our EBIT gross margin was at around 300 basis points and clearly exceeded our year-end target of 200 to 250 basis points. And we do expect that the second half should show some more transaction volume as markets become clear and take a point of view also mainly interest rate development. And therefore, we are confident and are maintaining on the business targets as well as our year-end business volume on balance sheet. And with this, I'll hand back to Jochen.\nJochen Klosges: Thanks, Christof. Let's now turn to our second business line; Banking and Digital Solutions, which has developed very favorably. The effect of higher interest rate is especially visible here. At EUR 52 million, net interest income has more than quadrupled since the first quarter of 2022, and we have maintained the volume of deposits above our target level of around EUR 13 million. It is probably important to emphasize in this context that the structure of our deposits is very granular due to the fact that we executed payment transactions for 3,700 housing industry clients, managing roughly 8 million rental units. It is also welcome that net commission income continues to grow. Our strategy is clearly bearing fruit here as well. And that also holds true for our third segment, Aareon. In addition to ensuring growth, we are striving to increase the share of recurring revenues, which now account for 75% of total revenues. Overall, Aareon's revenue has increased by 15% year-on-year. Likewise adjusted EBITDA continues to move up. Aareon remains on its growth path, helped by further M&A activities. Nonetheless, as I said back in March, we still have room for efficiency improvements. We are tackling this issue via an early retirement program as well as by streamlining our product portfolio and processes. Aareon's task for '23 is to make the company even more competitive. We are supporting Aareon in our capacity as shareholders [indiscernible] funds. At the same time, we need to maintain growth and income momentum in the new business. And whilst we're pretty successful on both counts, during the first quarter, there is still a good deal of work to do for everybody around in Aareon. In the meantime, we are expecting the first positive contributions from the product and project optimization measures currently being implemented. Back in March, I reported that we would be consolidating our product portfolio, complementing it by adding an open platform. To this end, we have already established the Aareon Connect partner program. In Germany, that will provide better help to our clients in reaching their goals and keep supporting them with their digital transformation. What does this mean specifically? Our clients can benefit from software solutions and services provided by various partners, which can be seamlessly integrated into Aareon's existing ERP systems. Put another way, Aareon Connect assumes the function of a marketplace where already more than 10 partner solutions are being offered at present. We will gradually expand this marketplace, creating initial collaboration and value creation system that offers added value for the entire sector. And now it's my pleasure to hand over again to our Chief Market Officer, Christof, who always join us in what some might call challenging times for the real estate industry. He will now provide more detailed information on our portfolio and his view about the market. Christof, floor is yours.\nChristof Winkelmann: Yes. Thank you very much, Jochen, for that nice introduction once again. I do have a bit of a feeling with a detailed view at least of one the later time that I was [indiscernible] of speaking to all of you. It was, I think, September of 2020, we were reporting on the Q2 figures of that year. And if you remember, that was just about the night of the onset of COVID. At that point in time, to explain how we would view the world going forward, not having a crystal ball, but taking our portfolio, the sponsors, the assets, locations, performance. I'm trying to guess the best that we can, how such a development could turn out looking at historical standards and measures and what we believe is a good amount of expertise in our house. We at that point in time projected the recovery of the hotel portfolio at that point in time with just above EUR 10 billion. It was going to take about 4 years, i.e., at the end of 2024. I think I've been called optimistic at that point in time by many different sources. It turns out to be that I was maybe too pessimistic because I think we got to that line 2 years earlier, that was at the end of last year, which was very favorable to all of us. And that's why [indiscernible] supporting that there is not a single hotel portfolio on the book as of today. I think it is a testament to how we approach not only hotels, but how we approach real estate. We are absolute experts. We are used to cycles that is part of being active in real estate. And also, as Jochen had alluded to beforehand, we haven't just started looking at U.S. office a couple of months ago. We have started that process already well at the beginning of last year, seeing signs that there might be a downturn in certain markets and had prepared ourselves. And last but not least, sometimes I get the feeling that the current status of maybe, let's call it, office U.S., it's overshadowing everything. I do remind you that, again, in that 2020 timeframe, we had the majority of our hotels closed. Likewise we had closed all of our -- most of our retail centers [indiscernible] and many other things happened. So I think that should put this into perspective and our ability to weather the storm that we believe we are in and not taking care of. So what are we doing or what have we done year-to-date? We are sticking to our diversification, both on asset classes as well as on regions. The book as of the end of March, is largely unchanged towards the end of December. As I said, very little transaction volume, but very value accredited new business that we were able to put on the books that are contributing to the bottom line of Aareal Bank AG. Our target still remains at EUR 32 million to EUR 33 billion, depending on currencies and transaction volumes, which we are very confident we will reach. Just to remind you, we are not active in development financing and we haven't been for more than a decade really. And we were also very successful at expanding our green loan program, which is at this point in time to end of March 31 at EUR 2.6 billion compared to EUR 0.7 billion only the year before. On Slide 11. As we always like transparency, you can see the development of our different asset classes across the globe on average since December of 2019. What is important to see is that in most cases, we are -- or in all cases actually, we are either at the same LTV that we were in the end of '19 and/or better. And likewise the same counts for yields and debt, has a portfolio on total was at an 8.9%, it's the field in the end of '19 versus 9.1% today, they attribute also to the recovery of the real estate industry over the past years. On Slide 12, I'll give details in a moment. But I think to say it is, we are coming out of a very long period of new monetary policy. In addition to that, we came out of a time of COVID, something the world has never experienced and mind you that most of the crisis at least that I have attend, had to attend to, always said, well, this never happened before. I remember the financial crisis, so was COVID, the point being that we are very good at adapting and managing risk that we take on book, and we are intending to do that likewise going forward. I think what is different this time around is the speed of the interest rate hikes. But that wasn't experienced not only in North America, but also in Europe, I think [indiscernible] a lot of experience that we jointly might have had. And yes, not everybody is working in the office like maybe beforehand, that is partly a very good thing. It gives flexibility. On the other hand, also may be a bad thing because it creates less of a demand in certain pockets. However, one thing is clear, there is an increasing trend of office attendance, though it was maybe slower in recovery than people might have thought. But there is an absolute increase quarter-over-quarter. As I said, the hotel and retail portfolio completely recovered, that is true to our global portfolio. And so is the office portfolio in Europe. We do not have any office in Asia-Pacific. [indiscernible] is doing very well. And that is why today, I'm here focusing a bit more on the bespoke office portfolio that we had in the U.S. Again, we are very broadly diversified and the current LTV on the overall book loan is at 55%. That is a very good portion below the onset of the financial crisis, just to put that into relation. We have put our risk management capabilities to the test over the past quarters and years. And sometimes we wish that we will have 2 or 3 years of boredom, not having to put them to the test, but do what we like doing and then we originate the mortgages that are value created to our portfolio. We are, at the same time, also in these times, supporting between transformation, people always like to go quicker and better and faster. I think we're doing a lot. And within the industry, availability of such transformation opportunities will become a very long way. Our team in U.S. has been there since 2006, and we have been active in the U.S. since 2000, demonstrating our dedication and commitment to that market, our knowhow and our continued investment in majority into the major MSA. And in that one, the CBDs that is our target business. On Page 13. As I said, we are diversified in property types. In the U.S., 50% are making -- are made up of office financings. Probably a lot of banks will have a higher percent of office. We, however, as you're very well aware of, we also like other asset classes such as hospitality and retail, which balances to our point of view and gives a diversification to the portfolio. Mind you that 91% of our portfolio on Aareal LTV are below 60%, which gives us a lot of room for any potential storm, but there might be only 1%, less than 1% is between 80% and 90%. Again, a testament to the quality and severance of that portfolio. On Page 14. We're now monitoring the U.S. portfolio in detail for more than a year. We have a little bit all of the assets that is including the Board members that have visited the majority of those assets to make sure that decisions that are being taken are the correct ones. And sometimes, they are tough decisions. Sometimes they are more fun decisions. I can tell you, I'd like the fun ones more. But the tougher also need to be taken, and we're doing that. I think we've shown that over the past 2 years, also in the U.S. with an increase in the NPL of the crisis or the pandemic and the decrease thereafter. JP Morgan, just to set the line for people, let's say that offices are not of use anymore. And especially when it comes to New York, people have figures in the minds of roughly 20% of vacancy. And that is true as an [indiscernible] of that market. I also then ask, what was the vacancy before COVID? And then most people can't answer. I can tell you, it's roughly 10%. So it wasn't 0 and went up to 20%, it went up by 10%. In [indiscernible] in New York, between 2019 and 2021, i.e., completely during the pandemic, some of the largest ever supply growth in New York office has happened, such as Hudson Yards demonstrating some 12 to 14 office buildings, skyscrapers by the way. And that's the loan -- built with 93 floors being 100% occupied [indiscernible]. It is natural that there will be some vacant space. And the tenant [indiscernible] vacant space is not the A Class, A market office buildings. It is the B class office buildings and the C class that tend to suffer more in these times because people are looking for quality. And by the way, they are willing to take that quality because it is conducive to the way to do business, to get people to work together. And that is something that we have seen across the globe, but also in the U.S. By the way, I'm not a fan of doing 4 to 5 days of home office simply for the fact that the same people that are promoting this today have told me only 3.5 years ago that we all need to be having a collaborative workspace, sitting next to each other [indiscernible]. So I think the truth is probably somewhere in between what it does today to give flexibility. Unfortunately working from office from Tuesday to Thursday and not on Friday and Monday, that gives a challenge, but still also means that they need to be paid because you can't just end that office from Tuesday to Thursday. We have about EUR 3.9 billion in office financings, spread across 50 transactions. That means the average size of our transaction is EUR 78 million in the U.S. The majority of that is A class office buildings in A class market. The average LTV as per quarter end is at 63% LTV. And let me tell you that we have revalued in the past 4 months all of our office exposure in the U.S. So this number might not entail 100% of the revaluations, but by far, the majority. And even after that, you see that the LTV is at 63%. It does not mean that there are some that are higher and some a bit lower. And it will be difficult in certain cases to manage through. But to put in perspective of what this level we're talking about, it is not a EUR 4 billion -- close to EUR 4 billion portfolio that is threatening our year or existence, that is sometimes written in diverse indicators. We have instead created a management overlay and assumed a 20% the value decrease of our portfolio, so Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisioning, improving an additional EUR 21 million. The yield on debt in our office portfolio stands at 6.6% in the U.S. overall. And if you are to exclude refurbishments, which we are doing as part of our regular business, it is a good portion above 7%. Furthermore, by far, the majority of our loans are hedged and are benefiting of independent hedges. Also may I remind you that only 11% of our tenants or the tenants of our clients expire with their leases in 2023 and in 2024, it's near 8%. So 19% over the next 24 months, I think this is very [indiscernible] amount. On Page 15. As I've mentioned, the yield on debt, if we were to exclude EUR 0.6 billion of refurbishment and traditional assets where we are helping these buildings to transition to a more ESG-friendly environment. The yield on debt would be sitting at 7.6% versus the 6.9% overall. As I also mentioned, we are largely located in A market, mainly with 3 -- sorry, in A Class buildings with 3.1 billion out of the total portfolio, 0.8 are Class B buildings and only 50 million are Class C buildings. Let me also remind you just to look at the classification of the building, these Class B buildings are located in Class A market. So if you were in New York to look at the [indiscernible] which is a very -- and very, very, very expensive market to live and work in. These buildings, brownstone buildings, they don't qualify as a Class A building and they never will. But they're very sought after, and they do have a reason for existence. So it gives you a perspective on where our perceived risks are. Only 2%, if you look at the layered LTV perspective, are between 70% to 80%. And as I said, almost 90% in allocation. On Page 16. We have, in addition to our overlay, showing you what happens automatically, if we were to experience a 25% average variability decrease in our portfolio. It is very steady. We have also looked at the market averages. The average in the U.S. market currently assumes 15% value decrease for Class A, 40% for Class, B and 60% for Class C, which gives it a total average of 35% across the U.S. If we were to mirror our portfolio and its locations according to this grid, we would be at roughly 20% average value decrease. And the above 25% value decrease with [indiscernible] our average LTV would go from 63% to 83%. I think it's a very manageable LTV range. Looking at the loan book and asset quality on Page 17. If you look over the past 3 years, amidst the pandemic, we were able to largely decrease our NPL exposure. We have reduced our nonperforming loans by almost EUR 600 million, more than 1/3 since the peak of the same. We've set out our strategic goal and I mentioned that to you of sustainably reducing our NPL ratio to below 3%, which will cost some money, but it will increase and further strengthen our resilience. Our strong profitability allows us to do this. As you can see this quarter, we are taking additional provisioning and despite having a very good quarter, as Marc has mentioned, we have budgeted, as you know, some EUR 60 million in addition for the quicker derisking. We have not used that in the first quarter. We are working on transactions and we're very confident that we might invest some of that to further decrease our NPL. Overall, these are challenging times, but challenging times in the U.S. market and challenging times in the U.S. office market. It is not a challenging time in the European office market or in any other asset classes. We are on it. And with those words, I will hand it back to Marc.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you, Christof, for the insight. Now let's take a look our balance sheet structure. We are conservatively funded our EUR 25 billion of long-term funds, has a longer maturity than our commercial real estate lending book. In addition, with our housing industry payment profit of over EUR 13 billion and retail deposits of EUR 1.4 billion, we have established a well-diversified and stable funding and liquidity base. Our liquidity and funding ratio stood at comfortable 240% for the LCR and 123% for the NSFR, respectively, at the end of March. Treasury portfolio investments are in very liquid, mainly public sector bonds. And as we hedge our balance sheet against interest rate changes, we have no significant unrealized losses in the portfolio. On the funding side, you can see that on Page 20, our broad diversification has been beneficial during the opening quarter of the current year. This leaves us less affected by capital market volatility, which has been especially pronounced given the events in the U.S. and the Swiss banking sector. Our funding activities were very successful in the first quarter. We issued fund [indiscernible] total of EUR 1.7 billion, of which EUR 1.5 billion was in the form of benchmark issues. Our retail deposits business launched last year to supplement payment deposits from the housing industry continues to develop very favorably. We crossed the EUR 1 billion threshold at the end of February and have now reached EUR 1.4 billion, more than twice the level at the end of 2022, which was EUR 600 million. And the figures are keeping on driving. Payment deposits from the housing industry averaged EUR 13.7 billion in the first quarter, exceeding our target level of around EUR 13 billion. These deposits are the largest component in our funding mix, accounting for 33%. However, as we have emphasized in the past, we anticipate fluctuations here, for example, due to the outflows caused by the change to the deposit guarantee schemes. It was against this background that we set our more conservative full year target of EUR 14 billion back in early March. Let me remind you, and Jochen already said, that those deposits are generated from our competitive position as the #1 payment provider for the German housing industry. We have 3,700 housing industry companies being outlined, and they're managing 8 million flats. Thus a very granular deposit structure. Our capital position improved further during the first quarter. The CET1 ratio grew slightly compared to the 2022 year-end to reach 19.4%. Leverage ratio stands at 6%, also very solid levels. I also want to comment on unrealized losses on bond holdings following the strong rise in interest rates over the past month. As I just mentioned already, Aareal Bank hedges its interest rate changes, exposure almost entirely. At the end of March, unrealized losses on the bond portfolio only accounted to approximately 3% of our equity and were fully deducted from economic capital. The OCI position was even slightly positive. So coming to the outlook. As you can see, Aareal Bank made a very good start to the year. Of course, we continue to be aware of the persistent and very high level of uncertainty in the economy and markets. But this start, let us look ahead to the remainder of the year with confidence. Accordingly, we can confirm our targets for the full year. In particular, we expect that net interest income will come in at the upper end or even above our forecast range between EUR 730 million and EUR 770 million -- EUR 770 million. This provides us with sufficient headroom should, and I emphasize should, the loss amounts unexpectedly exceed our anticipated range of EUR 130 million to EUR 210 million. Overall, we are therefore confident that we were able to achieve operating profit of EUR 240 million to EUR 280 million, as communicated earlier. With this, let me hand back to Jochen for his concluding remarks.\nJochen Klosges: Thank you, Marc, and thank you, Christof, again. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, let me summarize. You know the markets of the competitive environment and the macroeconomic outlook are really changing. Yet Aareal Bank Group has proven often enough that it can be successful even in difficult conditions. We plan further growth in 2023, of course, profitable and always very risk aware. The strong start to the New Year with more than double the group operating profit underpins our confidence. In all 3 segments, we see that our strategy is working, so we intend to hold a steady course. At the same time, we will continue to invest in the efficiency of our platform and the resilience of our business models. And finally, a pending takeover by the financial investors will further improve our position for sustained and successful development. And now we are looking forward to answer your questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question for today is from Johannes Thormann from HSBC.\nJohannes Thormann: Three questions I have mainly. First of all, on the risk side, you show a EUR 21 million risk overlay in your loan loss provisions, but also -- and you just say this is an overlay for the U.S. business, but also you shown an increase in EUR 12 million by the U.S. NPLs despite, of course, negative FX effects, which should normally have decreased the absolute value of NPLs. What has been driving this? And then why -- what kind of impairment this has been? Secondly, on your confidence to reach the EUR 32 billion new business volumes -- EUR 32 billion asset volume and the EUR 9 billion business volumes. What are you seeing in the market? Why transactions will come back again at least in the second half of this year? And then could you also elaborate on the margins you took for the renewals? Is this more renewals business driving this new business? Or is this really the business? And last but not least, on restructuring of Aareon, you booked EUR 34 million. Is this all? Or do we have to expect more for the rest of the year? And then, yes, anything else at Aareon, which needs to be cleaned up?\nJochen Klosges: So I will take up your first question about Aareon and Christof will answer your question about the new business in the market. And finally, Marc will answer your question about demand and overlay. Let me start with Aareon. So yes, we clearly gave guidance that we expect a certain amount of money to be invested into Aareon in the year '23 to enhance their capabilities in terms of being more efficient, streamlined portfolio, et cetera, et cetera. And you're right, already in the Q1, we booked thereof EUR 34 million. That means we are well on track in terms of executing on the various measures we see to be executed this year.  Might there be an additional investment to be seen in the course of this year? I wouldn't exclude that today because we are in an ongoing path to examine where we see further room for improvement. So nothing which would, in any case, harm our total forecast for the year. That's -- and the team you know, we have quite a freshened and very active team there on board since the last year. And of course, it's their path and opportunity currently to find various areas and corners where they probably see further room for improvement. And we really support that -- yes, so there might be a little bit more to come this year, but this is not currently specifically to be foreseen because it's an ongoing process to see in which area of Aareon could improve its efficiency. But again, as I mentioned in my speech here, Johannes, in the same time, it's very important that the team is able and they are able to keep the momentum, our revenue growth and EBITDA growth in place, and that's something where we can report the first quarter was quite successful. So I always pull it in a way that I say we have 2 opportunities. One opportunity is currently to really keep the momentum and growth in terms of revenues and profitability. And secondly, to see where can we improve the capabilities and processes of Aareon in the same time. And we have the funds for that generally in place. And so, yes, we are quite optimistic that '23 will be a very good year for Aareon at the end of the day.\nChristof Winkelmann: Johannes, I would like to take your first question. On the NPS, as you can see on that page, we have the one new NPL that was indeed on U.S. office buildings, smaller ones, smaller than EUR 50 million. We also had an outflow of one NPL in the U.S. that was a residential building. So overall, quite low increase of the NPLs in the U.S., but only EUR 12 million, as I just said. The risk provisions that on top of the overlay had to be booked in the U.S. with only single-digit number. So that was related to the one new NPL that we have here.\nMarc Hess: Yes. And as to your second question. As I've mentioned, the transaction volume has been somewhat low in the first quarter. We're not seeing a lot of pick up in the second quarter. So when you're competing and looking for the right risk return, at this point in time, sometimes you get presented or you find right projects. And sometimes, you don't want to compete because maybe these projects are not [indiscernible] return for risk perspective. As you have seen with the figures, we've been very successful in selecting very favorable transactions during the first quarter. And if you were to ask me, what will you tell me, Christof, when we're here in the second quarter call, I would tell you that our pipeline at this point in time has grown very substantially and that by the end of the second quarter, you would be very pleased with the reported figures when it comes to the expected new business as well as the risk return that we are catching to it. So maybe that as much as a view going forward till the end of June. The second thing is, as we've said in the first quarter, EUR 500 million were renewals and EUR 600 million was new business. And that is actually quite good and not to affect because why would -- why [indiscernible] finance on the balance sheet either with the sale. And as we just mentioned, the transaction volume was rather low. So that doesn't happen that often. The second thing is that a lot of boards don't want to sell at these times and will extend with you in order to have a better, more opportune selling time down the future and also in the U.S., just to ramp that up. On these extensions we are, especially in U.S., able to receive further security and downpayments with largely increased spreads. So overall, I would say that the renewal business is probably at least as attractive as the new business, if not more, because the board also for those certain costs and this certainly would have, if we were to transfer and go to another bank. So I think it's a win-win for both sides and overall both walk off quite confident.\nJohannes Thormann: Sorry, if I may add 2 follow-up questions on this. Christof, you said you're not seeing a pickup of transactions in the market [indiscernible] grown substantially. So the growth in the pipeline is just from prolongations and what is driving this? And the second thing is on the renewal business. If you say the margins are -- business is as attractive as the really new business. Are the margins on the same level?\nChristof Winkelmann: Yes, absolutely. So what is going the pipeline? It would be very nice if I could pick and choose which kind of assets are on the market for an acquisition finance or refinance in other banks at all times. So it is a bit dependent on when these transactions come to market. And if they come to market, they're looking especially in these times for surety of execution, for expertise, and reliability. And we have been working in parallel to doing the business on building that pipeline with those transactions that are requiring the expertise that we have set out to do that we have in-house when it comes to different asset classes, when it comes to, of course, order portfolios, crosscut arise, very granular. And it also depends on what kind of buyer is currently buying. So in these markets, usually buyers that need less leverage are very substantial in value network. Those are the buyers. So they come along and increment and unfortunately always [indiscernible] when you want them. So the pipeline going forward, we're telling you, is nearly that pattern as compared to nearly new, new business, new business origination. In parallel, to the second question on the prolongations. As I've said, it is an economic mathematical exercise because, again, if you transfer your loan to another bank, there are certain cost risks and time associated with it. So what I can say is that with approximately the same risk parameters, we would be getting, let's call it, a couple of hands or more full of basis points above new business because the cost, as I said, are dispersed. So as I said, it's very attractive to us to follow this business. It is not second class on the contrary, I think at this point in time, I would love to have more of those just because we know these assets. We've had them for a while and our Board is committed.\nOperator: The next question comes from Timo Dums from DZ Bank.\nTimo Dums: Thank you for taking my question and also for sharing the additional details on the U.S. and office portfolio. So starting with the takeover, could you maybe share with us a little bit more details or color on why the ECB approval has not been granted yet, looking at the other authorities that have been moving already? Then secondly, on NII, I mean, you've also tried a strong increase and you're in the big countries and also going forward and basically announced that you may end up above the range of EUR million to EUR million. Could you maybe provide us with sort of an NII trajectory further going down the road? Because when I just annualize this quarterly results, I'm really well above the target range. Then on my last question is then on the NPL this total or the acceleration that you announced in the previous quarter. So the presentation says that you have already started the process. Could you give some more color and also how we should think about the EUR 60 million in the account [indiscernible] this is sufficient between the top-up that amount or how we should think about that?\nJochen Klosges: Yes. Timo, thanks for the question. Let me start with the question on takeover, and then I will try to answer also your question number 3 about NPL, and I guess Marc will take care of the question regarding the net interest income trajectory. So takeover, to be pretty honest, this is -- you know that a process between the investors and the authorities. So that is usual to all have this in minds. I guess -- so it's a huge success so far that the investors who are able to receive all the necessary approvals so far except of the ECB, but this is something which is -- which seems to be seems to be something like a standard process. But basically the ECB is the final one who grant them the approval. Everybody knows that the promised update is the 24th of May. The ECB has to check everything in detail. It's from our regulatory and potential point of view, something which is also, let's say, put it that way, create extra work for the teams within the ECB. So we are here pretty confident and share the point of view of our investors that there will be a decision until the 24th of May. And so finally, I guess, it is kind of normal setting we are currently in. And let's see what's going to be the outcome. But as I already mentioned in my speech, everybody is pretty confident that there will be a positive decision finally. However, it's the call of the ECB. And so, I guess, I would like to tell you more about this, but we need to be cautious and see things going on here. Regarding the NPL, I must say and I'll take a look at Christof as well. I guess when we introduced the extra budget of EUR 16 million back in early March, so nothing really new has happened since then. Our view is unchanged. We are trying to use that amount of money to reduce our NPLs further. We are working currently on a number of transaction activities. But please forgive me that I won't tell you something about details, that won't be really favorable for our prices, in that case, obviously. But finally, I can only say our view has not really changed since early March. That's what I want to say to NPL. Marc, over to you regarding the net interest income.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you for your questions. I mean, this is difficult to answer because I've already given you guidance. And of course, hopefully understanding that I'm not going to be much more precise. I think it's obvious the upper range of our target of EUR 170 million is well in reach, and there is a good likelihood that finally we will be above that line. Will it be, let's say, 4x the number that we have seen in Q1? Well, probably not really. I think we have always guided that we expect some kind of outflow on the deposits, EUR 13 billion is our target. You have seen we were at EUR 13.7 billion. This has several federal resources. One is the USF reform where we see some adjustments on the client side. The other one is, as we explained that many of our depositors from the housing industry, they accumulated buffers with the energy crisis and everything other than, let's say, second half of last year. We also here, we expect the kind of normalization. So that's one factor. And the other thing, you have seen that the rate increase, especially since September was really accelerated at the market, and it's always a little bit [indiscernible] let's say, to adjust the rates paid on the deposits. So all in all, as I just said, I'm very optimistic. But please, I hope for your understanding that I will not be more precise in giving you a guidance here for a year-end number in net interest income.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Stuart Graham from Autonomous Research LLP.\nStuart Graham: I have one bigger picture question and two [indiscernible] number questions, please. The bigger picture question is, how important do you think the likely credit curtailment from U.S. regional banks is going to be in U.S. office valuations as you know they're major financiers in U.S. office? And giving their own problems, they're likely to be cutting credit, I would imagine. That's the first question. Then my two [indiscernible] number questions again on the U.S. office, apologies. First, how much of the EUR 3.8 billion is currently classified as Stage 2 or Stage 3? And then second, how large is the stock of provisions, including the EUR 21 million overlay against the EUR 3.8 billion CRE of exposure, please?\nJochen Klosges: Second question will be answered by Marc. And first one will be answered by Christof and myself. So my view is if I take a look at the banking landscape in the U.S. that the current issues over there are pretty much connected to regional banks, which have been doing financing, regional commercial properties in their local neighborhoods. And therefore, I guess, there is hopefully a very limited spread to the development concerning banks, which have usually the exposures in the big metropolitan areas and plus allocations with Class A properties. So that's to be, pretty honest, I'm not really capable to judge the quality of the portfolio of these regional banks in the U.S., across the country. In terms of how could that development spread over to values of properties we [indiscernible] I would like to hand over to Christof.\nChristof Winkelmann: Yes. As Jochen was indicating, we have to look at what the regional banks, first of all, what is the regional bank and what are they financing. There was one bank that was located on the East Coast. And to my understanding, is a big bank. However, when it comes to real estate and/or commercial real estate, the average loan size was a single-digit million figure. And not located mostly in Manhattan -- like this. So I think that the regional banks will probably have more an effect on these kind of assets, more regional, small in size, I'm not saying that a retail bank can finance a larger building. But the clear majority will probably be more in regional assets and smaller size, whereas the Manhattan is mostly taken care of more of the super banks, the large banks, large insurance companies, debt funds, and [indiscernible] structures. So if you would ask me what is the impact. For the time being, we have not seen an impact. I'm not saying there can't be any impact, but I don't believe that that will be major towards the commercial real estate that we finance.\nStuart Graham: Sorry, I'm just asking negative questions, apologies.\nJochen Klosges: Not a problem.\nChristof Winkelmann: So look, for the total U.S. portfolio of EUR 3.9 billion, we currently have in stage , but let me remind all of you that indicates a relative dilution, on the relative dilution to the initial parameters who were very good, and it doesn't tell you about the absolute risk profile, which is still good. We have 4% in Stage 3, so around EUR 160 million of the office NPLs that you can see here on that page is U.S.-related. And for Stage 1 and 2, the total risk provisioning is EUR 38 million.\nStuart Graham: Sorry, the 38% number, what was that? That was stage 2?\nMarc Hess: The 38% was Stage 2, 4% in Stage 3 and the EUR 38 million risk provision that is for Stage 1 and 2, including the management ofâ€¦\nStuart Graham: And then there would be some provisions on the 200 million NPLs as well, yes?\nMarc Hess: Yeah, of course, provision on the EUR 150 million NPL that is around a little bit more than EUR 10 million.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. And I now hand back to Jurgen Junginger for closing comments.\nJurgen Junginger: All right. Thank you for joining the conference call. And I think it was a really good conversation, really good discussion, really good questions we get from you. And as always, we are happy to take on follow-up questions. Thanks again. Have a good day and bye-bye.\nJochen Klosges: Thank you, everybody. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded, and you may disconnect your telephone. Thank you very much for joining, and have a pleasant day. Goodbye.",

It is my pleasure, and I would now like to turn the conference over to Jurgen Junginger, Head of IR. Please go ahead.\nJurgen Junginger: Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our conference call. Today, the agenda covers our results of the first quarter and the 2023 outlook and some additional information on our lending portfolio. I'm joined by our CEO, Jochen Klosges; our CFO, Marc Hess; and our Chief Market Officer, Christof Winkelmann. Jochen, Marc, and Christof will lead you through the presentation, and this will be followed by a Q&A session. Now I'm pleased to hand over to Jochen. Thank you.\nJochen Klosges: Jurgen, thank you very much. Good morning, everybody, and a warm welcome to the presentation of our results for the first quarter of 2023. It's been just over 2 months since we all have met. A lot has happened during this period. Regional banks in the U.S. [indiscernible] and 2 major Swiss banks merged into one. Markets were highly nervous at times and credit spreads for many institutions widened significantly. And there is once again a particular focus on property markets, which are now experiencing a correction after a decade of continuously rising prices. In this context, we have been seeing a more challenging environment for our U.S. office property finance portfolio since last summer. And consequently, we have been working with our clients on finding individual solutions and plans. We report on a quarter in which Aareal Group has once again performed very well indeed. Today we are talking about a quarter with good results and sound [indiscernible]. We have doubled operating profit compared to the first quarter of the '22 year. Once again, the key driver was on the income side. Our strategy, including growth initiatives, have paid off. Moreover, we were able to benefit from higher interest rates. We are also reporting a model that was announced and the volume of nonperforming loans has increased slightly. We remain very historically financed with our capital ratios for those reasons. Today, on the back of our good start into the year, we are confirming our full year outlook, which we presented in early March. Aareal Bank is capable of leading with turbulences and challenging market faces, something we've proved in coping with the coronavirus crisis to name just one example. Back then, you'll remember, 90% of the hotels we had financed were temporarily closed. And yet today, there is not a single nonperforming hotel closure in our portfolio. We are close to our clients and with our expertise, we anticipated and [indiscernible] the market development, which we're currently seeing in the U.S. In fact, we have been preparing for some time now. We are taking a selective, that is risk aware stance vis-a-vis new business. We are provisioning cautiously and our funding is well diversified. We regularly perform stress tests on our portfolios and consider different crisis scenarios. At the same time, Aareal Bank Group benefits from its second lineup. While rising interest rates are pressure in property valuations, higher interest rates are generally good yields for our deposit-taking business. Moreover, our software subsidiary, Aareon, is growing, which translates into higher net commission income. We continue to invest significant time and money there to further improve Aareon's position for the future. I will come back to this later. Before looking at the first quarter results in detail, I would like to comment on topics that you are likely to find just as interesting as of first quarter results. So what is the statements of the takeover by financial investors. So I will put it that way, we are currently on the home stretch. On April 11, the investors [indiscernible] that they have now also been given clearance by the monetary authority of Central Bank and Financial Markets Regulator. And yesterday approval was received from the German Banking Association for the deposit protection fund. This means that the approval by the European Central Bank is the only required regulatory clearance outstanding now. The investors are confident that they will obtain this highly long-stop date, which is the 24th of May. And now I would like to hand over to Marc, who will provide some more detailed information on our financials. Please, Marc.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you very much, Jochen, and good morning from my side as well. Let me start with an overview of the first quarter. We completed the quarter with an operating profit of EUR 62 million, as Jochen just mentioned, and that is double the figure of the same quarter in the previous year. The income side was the main driver here with net interest income up by 40% year-on-year. We are benefiting from rising interest rates as well as from portfolio growth over the last 12 months and from our broadly diversified funding mix. Yet commission income showed double-digit growth, too, driven by both the Banking and Digital Solutions segment and by Aareal's performance. The reported increase in admin expenses is attributable almost entirely to M&A and the announced efficiency measures at Aareal. The low level of risk provisions is also noteworthy, even more so since management overlay for U.S. office loans accounts for 2/3 of the reported figure of EUR 32 million. I will come back to that later. On the next slide, we take a more detailed look at the development of the key income components. With net interest income of EUR 222 million, we achieved the highest quarterly figure since becoming a public company back in 2002. This was driven by a combination of portfolio growth, good margins, thoroughly diversified funding along with the positive effects of the interest rate environment in our payment deposit business. Increase in net commission income to EUR 72 million was largely attributable to growth of Aareon with the share of recurring revenue steadily rising, reflecting the ongoing transition income in license-based model to a Software as a Service based model. In the Banking and Digital Solutions segment, we are also growing and substantially increasing net commission income. Overall, the [indiscernible] upward trend in income generation demonstrates that our strategy is paying good, as expected. And I can tell you, we are really satisfied with that performance. Turning to admin expenses. On the next slide, I would like to emphasize that cost control remains a top priority for us. Despite inflation, costs in the bank have increased only slightly because income ratio is at an outstanding 45% and thus markedly below our original target of around 44%. The reported increase in group admin expenses was due, on the one hand, to the investment in efficiency measures at Aareon, as already mentioned, and to acquisitions on the other hand there as well. When looking at costs, it's also worth noting that as usual for the first quarter of the year, they are inflated by the banking level that we booked fully the full EUR 25 million in Q1 as usual. The bank revenue is not included in the 35% of income ratio I mentioned, this is in line with the industry practice. So let me now turn to risk provisioning. As of today, we are hardly affected by the much discussed headwinds in the U.S. commercial property markets. What we do see, however, is some pressure on our property values, which we had anticipated. Accordingly, we have booked the management overlay of EUR 21 million. This reflects a conservative 20% markdown of the market values of our U.S. office portfolio. With this, I would like to hand back to Jochen and to Christof for further details on our 3 segments.\nChristof Winkelmann: Yes. Thank you, Marc. New business in the Structured Property Financing segment was in line with the somewhat lower transaction volumes that we have seen across our property markets. We were able to originate around EUR 1 billion of new business consisting of EUR 600 million of newly acquired business, around EUR 500 million of renewals. This is also a result of our continuing selective approach and be as risk aware as we always are and have been. Well, we have taken on the books to year-to-date is of very high quality and truly offered above-average margins also compared to our existing book and to market standards. The average LTV of this newly acquired business stands at 53%, mind you, same quarter last year where new business was at 57%, and the year prior at 61%. So we do see a decrease in the LTVs playing our conservative way of doing new business. And at the same time, our EBIT gross margin was at around 300 basis points and clearly exceeded our year-end target of 200 to 250 basis points. And we do expect that the second half should show some more transaction volume as markets become clear and take a point of view also mainly interest rate development. And therefore, we are confident and are maintaining on the business targets as well as our year-end business volume on balance sheet. And with this, I'll hand back to Jochen.\nJochen Klosges: Thanks, Christof. Let's now turn to our second business line; Banking and Digital Solutions, which has developed very favorably. The effect of higher interest rate is especially visible here. At EUR 52 million, net interest income has more than quadrupled since the first quarter of 2022, and we have maintained the volume of deposits above our target level of around EUR 13 million. It is probably important to emphasize in this context that the structure of our deposits is very granular due to the fact that we executed payment transactions for 3,700 housing industry clients, managing roughly 8 million rental units. It is also welcome that net commission income continues to grow. Our strategy is clearly bearing fruit here as well. And that also holds true for our third segment, Aareon. In addition to ensuring growth, we are striving to increase the share of recurring revenues, which now account for 75% of total revenues. Overall, Aareon's revenue has increased by 15% year-on-year. Likewise adjusted EBITDA continues to move up. Aareon remains on its growth path, helped by further M&A activities. Nonetheless, as I said back in March, we still have room for efficiency improvements. We are tackling this issue via an early retirement program as well as by streamlining our product portfolio and processes. Aareon's task for '23 is to make the company even more competitive. We are supporting Aareon in our capacity as shareholders [indiscernible] funds. At the same time, we need to maintain growth and income momentum in the new business. And whilst we're pretty successful on both counts, during the first quarter, there is still a good deal of work to do for everybody around in Aareon. In the meantime, we are expecting the first positive contributions from the product and project optimization measures currently being implemented. Back in March, I reported that we would be consolidating our product portfolio, complementing it by adding an open platform. To this end, we have already established the Aareon Connect partner program. In Germany, that will provide better help to our clients in reaching their goals and keep supporting them with their digital transformation. What does this mean specifically? Our clients can benefit from software solutions and services provided by various partners, which can be seamlessly integrated into Aareon's existing ERP systems. Put another way, Aareon Connect assumes the function of a marketplace where already more than 10 partner solutions are being offered at present. We will gradually expand this marketplace, creating initial collaboration and value creation system that offers added value for the entire sector. And now it's my pleasure to hand over again to our Chief Market Officer, Christof, who always join us in what some might call challenging times for the real estate industry. He will now provide more detailed information on our portfolio and his view about the market. Christof, floor is yours.\nChristof Winkelmann: Yes. Thank you very much, Jochen, for that nice introduction once again. I do have a bit of a feeling with a detailed view at least of one the later time that I was [indiscernible] of speaking to all of you. It was, I think, September of 2020, we were reporting on the Q2 figures of that year. And if you remember, that was just about the night of the onset of COVID. At that point in time, to explain how we would view the world going forward, not having a crystal ball, but taking our portfolio, the sponsors, the assets, locations, performance. I'm trying to guess the best that we can, how such a development could turn out looking at historical standards and measures and what we believe is a good amount of expertise in our house. We at that point in time projected the recovery of the hotel portfolio at that point in time with just above EUR 10 billion. It was going to take about 4 years, i.e., at the end of 2024. I think I've been called optimistic at that point in time by many different sources. It turns out to be that I was maybe too pessimistic because I think we got to that line 2 years earlier, that was at the end of last year, which was very favorable to all of us. And that's why [indiscernible] supporting that there is not a single hotel portfolio on the book as of today. I think it is a testament to how we approach not only hotels, but how we approach real estate. We are absolute experts. We are used to cycles that is part of being active in real estate. And also, as Jochen had alluded to beforehand, we haven't just started looking at U.S. office a couple of months ago. We have started that process already well at the beginning of last year, seeing signs that there might be a downturn in certain markets and had prepared ourselves. And last but not least, sometimes I get the feeling that the current status of maybe, let's call it, office U.S., it's overshadowing everything. I do remind you that, again, in that 2020 timeframe, we had the majority of our hotels closed. Likewise we had closed all of our -- most of our retail centers [indiscernible] and many other things happened. So I think that should put this into perspective and our ability to weather the storm that we believe we are in and not taking care of. So what are we doing or what have we done year-to-date? We are sticking to our diversification, both on asset classes as well as on regions. The book as of the end of March, is largely unchanged towards the end of December. As I said, very little transaction volume, but very value accredited new business that we were able to put on the books that are contributing to the bottom line of Aareal Bank AG. Our target still remains at EUR 32 million to EUR 33 billion, depending on currencies and transaction volumes, which we are very confident we will reach. Just to remind you, we are not active in development financing and we haven't been for more than a decade really. And we were also very successful at expanding our green loan program, which is at this point in time to end of March 31 at EUR 2.6 billion compared to EUR 0.7 billion only the year before. On Slide 11. As we always like transparency, you can see the development of our different asset classes across the globe on average since December of 2019. What is important to see is that in most cases, we are -- or in all cases actually, we are either at the same LTV that we were in the end of '19 and/or better. And likewise the same counts for yields and debt, has a portfolio on total was at an 8.9%, it's the field in the end of '19 versus 9.1% today, they attribute also to the recovery of the real estate industry over the past years. On Slide 12, I'll give details in a moment. But I think to say it is, we are coming out of a very long period of new monetary policy. In addition to that, we came out of a time of COVID, something the world has never experienced and mind you that most of the crisis at least that I have attend, had to attend to, always said, well, this never happened before. I remember the financial crisis, so was COVID, the point being that we are very good at adapting and managing risk that we take on book, and we are intending to do that likewise going forward. I think what is different this time around is the speed of the interest rate hikes. But that wasn't experienced not only in North America, but also in Europe, I think [indiscernible] a lot of experience that we jointly might have had. And yes, not everybody is working in the office like maybe beforehand, that is partly a very good thing. It gives flexibility. On the other hand, also may be a bad thing because it creates less of a demand in certain pockets. However, one thing is clear, there is an increasing trend of office attendance, though it was maybe slower in recovery than people might have thought. But there is an absolute increase quarter-over-quarter. As I said, the hotel and retail portfolio completely recovered, that is true to our global portfolio. And so is the office portfolio in Europe. We do not have any office in Asia-Pacific. [indiscernible] is doing very well. And that is why today, I'm here focusing a bit more on the bespoke office portfolio that we had in the U.S. Again, we are very broadly diversified and the current LTV on the overall book loan is at 55%. That is a very good portion below the onset of the financial crisis, just to put that into relation. We have put our risk management capabilities to the test over the past quarters and years. And sometimes we wish that we will have 2 or 3 years of boredom, not having to put them to the test, but do what we like doing and then we originate the mortgages that are value created to our portfolio. We are, at the same time, also in these times, supporting between transformation, people always like to go quicker and better and faster. I think we're doing a lot. And within the industry, availability of such transformation opportunities will become a very long way. Our team in U.S. has been there since 2006, and we have been active in the U.S. since 2000, demonstrating our dedication and commitment to that market, our knowhow and our continued investment in majority into the major MSA. And in that one, the CBDs that is our target business. On Page 13. As I said, we are diversified in property types. In the U.S., 50% are making -- are made up of office financings. Probably a lot of banks will have a higher percent of office. We, however, as you're very well aware of, we also like other asset classes such as hospitality and retail, which balances to our point of view and gives a diversification to the portfolio. Mind you that 91% of our portfolio on Aareal LTV are below 60%, which gives us a lot of room for any potential storm, but there might be only 1%, less than 1% is between 80% and 90%. Again, a testament to the quality and severance of that portfolio. On Page 14. We're now monitoring the U.S. portfolio in detail for more than a year. We have a little bit all of the assets that is including the Board members that have visited the majority of those assets to make sure that decisions that are being taken are the correct ones. And sometimes, they are tough decisions. Sometimes they are more fun decisions. I can tell you, I'd like the fun ones more. But the tougher also need to be taken, and we're doing that. I think we've shown that over the past 2 years, also in the U.S. with an increase in the NPL of the crisis or the pandemic and the decrease thereafter. JP Morgan, just to set the line for people, let's say that offices are not of use anymore. And especially when it comes to New York, people have figures in the minds of roughly 20% of vacancy. And that is true as an [indiscernible] of that market. I also then ask, what was the vacancy before COVID? And then most people can't answer. I can tell you, it's roughly 10%. So it wasn't 0 and went up to 20%, it went up by 10%. In [indiscernible] in New York, between 2019 and 2021, i.e., completely during the pandemic, some of the largest ever supply growth in New York office has happened, such as Hudson Yards demonstrating some 12 to 14 office buildings, skyscrapers by the way. And that's the loan -- built with 93 floors being 100% occupied [indiscernible]. It is natural that there will be some vacant space. And the tenant [indiscernible] vacant space is not the A Class, A market office buildings. It is the B class office buildings and the C class that tend to suffer more in these times because people are looking for quality. And by the way, they are willing to take that quality because it is conducive to the way to do business, to get people to work together. And that is something that we have seen across the globe, but also in the U.S. By the way, I'm not a fan of doing 4 to 5 days of home office simply for the fact that the same people that are promoting this today have told me only 3.5 years ago that we all need to be having a collaborative workspace, sitting next to each other [indiscernible]. So I think the truth is probably somewhere in between what it does today to give flexibility. Unfortunately working from office from Tuesday to Thursday and not on Friday and Monday, that gives a challenge, but still also means that they need to be paid because you can't just end that office from Tuesday to Thursday. We have about EUR 3.9 billion in office financings, spread across 50 transactions. That means the average size of our transaction is EUR 78 million in the U.S. The majority of that is A class office buildings in A class market. The average LTV as per quarter end is at 63% LTV. And let me tell you that we have revalued in the past 4 months all of our office exposure in the U.S. So this number might not entail 100% of the revaluations, but by far, the majority. And even after that, you see that the LTV is at 63%. It does not mean that there are some that are higher and some a bit lower. And it will be difficult in certain cases to manage through. But to put in perspective of what this level we're talking about, it is not a EUR 4 billion -- close to EUR 4 billion portfolio that is threatening our year or existence, that is sometimes written in diverse indicators. We have instead created a management overlay and assumed a 20% the value decrease of our portfolio, so Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisioning, improving an additional EUR 21 million. The yield on debt in our office portfolio stands at 6.6% in the U.S. overall. And if you are to exclude refurbishments, which we are doing as part of our regular business, it is a good portion above 7%. Furthermore, by far, the majority of our loans are hedged and are benefiting of independent hedges. Also may I remind you that only 11% of our tenants or the tenants of our clients expire with their leases in 2023 and in 2024, it's near 8%. So 19% over the next 24 months, I think this is very [indiscernible] amount. On Page 15. As I've mentioned, the yield on debt, if we were to exclude EUR 0.6 billion of refurbishment and traditional assets where we are helping these buildings to transition to a more ESG-friendly environment. The yield on debt would be sitting at 7.6% versus the 6.9% overall. As I also mentioned, we are largely located in A market, mainly with 3 -- sorry, in A Class buildings with 3.1 billion out of the total portfolio, 0.8 are Class B buildings and only 50 million are Class C buildings. Let me also remind you just to look at the classification of the building, these Class B buildings are located in Class A market. So if you were in New York to look at the [indiscernible] which is a very -- and very, very, very expensive market to live and work in. These buildings, brownstone buildings, they don't qualify as a Class A building and they never will. But they're very sought after, and they do have a reason for existence. So it gives you a perspective on where our perceived risks are. Only 2%, if you look at the layered LTV perspective, are between 70% to 80%. And as I said, almost 90% in allocation. On Page 16. We have, in addition to our overlay, showing you what happens automatically, if we were to experience a 25% average variability decrease in our portfolio. It is very steady. We have also looked at the market averages. The average in the U.S. market currently assumes 15% value decrease for Class A, 40% for Class, B and 60% for Class C, which gives it a total average of 35% across the U.S. If we were to mirror our portfolio and its locations according to this grid, we would be at roughly 20% average value decrease. And the above 25% value decrease with [indiscernible] our average LTV would go from 63% to 83%. I think it's a very manageable LTV range. Looking at the loan book and asset quality on Page 17. If you look over the past 3 years, amidst the pandemic, we were able to largely decrease our NPL exposure. We have reduced our nonperforming loans by almost EUR 600 million, more than 1/3 since the peak of the same. We've set out our strategic goal and I mentioned that to you of sustainably reducing our NPL ratio to below 3%, which will cost some money, but it will increase and further strengthen our resilience. Our strong profitability allows us to do this. As you can see this quarter, we are taking additional provisioning and despite having a very good quarter, as Marc has mentioned, we have budgeted, as you know, some EUR 60 million in addition for the quicker derisking. We have not used that in the first quarter. We are working on transactions and we're very confident that we might invest some of that to further decrease our NPL. Overall, these are challenging times, but challenging times in the U.S. market and challenging times in the U.S. office market. It is not a challenging time in the European office market or in any other asset classes. We are on it. And with those words, I will hand it back to Marc.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you, Christof, for the insight. Now let's take a look our balance sheet structure. We are conservatively funded our EUR 25 billion of long-term funds, has a longer maturity than our commercial real estate lending book. In addition, with our housing industry payment profit of over EUR 13 billion and retail deposits of EUR 1.4 billion, we have established a well-diversified and stable funding and liquidity base. Our liquidity and funding ratio stood at comfortable 240% for the LCR and 123% for the NSFR, respectively, at the end of March. Treasury portfolio investments are in very liquid, mainly public sector bonds. And as we hedge our balance sheet against interest rate changes, we have no significant unrealized losses in the portfolio. On the funding side, you can see that on Page 20, our broad diversification has been beneficial during the opening quarter of the current year. This leaves us less affected by capital market volatility, which has been especially pronounced given the events in the U.S. and the Swiss banking sector. Our funding activities were very successful in the first quarter. We issued fund [indiscernible] total of EUR 1.7 billion, of which EUR 1.5 billion was in the form of benchmark issues. Our retail deposits business launched last year to supplement payment deposits from the housing industry continues to develop very favorably. We crossed the EUR 1 billion threshold at the end of February and have now reached EUR 1.4 billion, more than twice the level at the end of 2022, which was EUR 600 million. And the figures are keeping on driving. Payment deposits from the housing industry averaged EUR 13.7 billion in the first quarter, exceeding our target level of around EUR 13 billion. These deposits are the largest component in our funding mix, accounting for 33%. However, as we have emphasized in the past, we anticipate fluctuations here, for example, due to the outflows caused by the change to the deposit guarantee schemes. It was against this background that we set our more conservative full year target of EUR 14 billion back in early March. Let me remind you, and Jochen already said, that those deposits are generated from our competitive position as the #1 payment provider for the German housing industry. We have 3,700 housing industry companies being outlined, and they're managing 8 million flats. Thus a very granular deposit structure. Our capital position improved further during the first quarter. The CET1 ratio grew slightly compared to the 2022 year-end to reach 19.4%. Leverage ratio stands at 6%, also very solid levels. I also want to comment on unrealized losses on bond holdings following the strong rise in interest rates over the past month. As I just mentioned already, Aareal Bank hedges its interest rate changes, exposure almost entirely. At the end of March, unrealized losses on the bond portfolio only accounted to approximately 3% of our equity and were fully deducted from economic capital. The OCI position was even slightly positive. So coming to the outlook. As you can see, Aareal Bank made a very good start to the year. Of course, we continue to be aware of the persistent and very high level of uncertainty in the economy and markets. But this start, let us look ahead to the remainder of the year with confidence. Accordingly, we can confirm our targets for the full year. In particular, we expect that net interest income will come in at the upper end or even above our forecast range between EUR 730 million and EUR 770 million -- EUR 770 million. This provides us with sufficient headroom should, and I emphasize should, the loss amounts unexpectedly exceed our anticipated range of EUR 130 million to EUR 210 million. Overall, we are therefore confident that we were able to achieve operating profit of EUR 240 million to EUR 280 million, as communicated earlier. With this, let me hand back to Jochen for his concluding remarks.\nJochen Klosges: Thank you, Marc, and thank you, Christof, again. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, let me summarize. You know the markets of the competitive environment and the macroeconomic outlook are really changing. Yet Aareal Bank Group has proven often enough that it can be successful even in difficult conditions. We plan further growth in 2023, of course, profitable and always very risk aware. The strong start to the New Year with more than double the group operating profit underpins our confidence. In all 3 segments, we see that our strategy is working, so we intend to hold a steady course. At the same time, we will continue to invest in the efficiency of our platform and the resilience of our business models. And finally, a pending takeover by the financial investors will further improve our position for sustained and successful development. And now we are looking forward to answer your questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question for today is from Johannes Thormann from HSBC.\nJohannes Thormann: Three questions I have mainly. First of all, on the risk side, you show a EUR 21 million risk overlay in your loan loss provisions, but also -- and you just say this is an overlay for the U.S. business, but also you shown an increase in EUR 12 million by the U.S. NPLs despite, of course, negative FX effects, which should normally have decreased the absolute value of NPLs. What has been driving this? And then why -- what kind of impairment this has been? Secondly, on your confidence to reach the EUR 32 billion new business volumes -- EUR 32 billion asset volume and the EUR 9 billion business volumes. What are you seeing in the market? Why transactions will come back again at least in the second half of this year? And then could you also elaborate on the margins you took for the renewals? Is this more renewals business driving this new business? Or is this really the business? And last but not least, on restructuring of Aareon, you booked EUR 34 million. Is this all? Or do we have to expect more for the rest of the year? And then, yes, anything else at Aareon, which needs to be cleaned up?\nJochen Klosges: So I will take up your first question about Aareon and Christof will answer your question about the new business in the market. And finally, Marc will answer your question about demand and overlay. Let me start with Aareon. So yes, we clearly gave guidance that we expect a certain amount of money to be invested into Aareon in the year '23 to enhance their capabilities in terms of being more efficient, streamlined portfolio, et cetera, et cetera. And you're right, already in the Q1, we booked thereof EUR 34 million. That means we are well on track in terms of executing on the various measures we see to be executed this year.  Might there be an additional investment to be seen in the course of this year? I wouldn't exclude that today because we are in an ongoing path to examine where we see further room for improvement. So nothing which would, in any case, harm our total forecast for the year. That's -- and the team you know, we have quite a freshened and very active team there on board since the last year. And of course, it's their path and opportunity currently to find various areas and corners where they probably see further room for improvement. And we really support that -- yes, so there might be a little bit more to come this year, but this is not currently specifically to be foreseen because it's an ongoing process to see in which area of Aareon could improve its efficiency. But again, as I mentioned in my speech here, Johannes, in the same time, it's very important that the team is able and they are able to keep the momentum, our revenue growth and EBITDA growth in place, and that's something where we can report the first quarter was quite successful. So I always pull it in a way that I say we have 2 opportunities. One opportunity is currently to really keep the momentum and growth in terms of revenues and profitability. And secondly, to see where can we improve the capabilities and processes of Aareon in the same time. And we have the funds for that generally in place. And so, yes, we are quite optimistic that '23 will be a very good year for Aareon at the end of the day.\nChristof Winkelmann: Johannes, I would like to take your first question. On the NPS, as you can see on that page, we have the one new NPL that was indeed on U.S. office buildings, smaller ones, smaller than EUR 50 million. We also had an outflow of one NPL in the U.S. that was a residential building. So overall, quite low increase of the NPLs in the U.S., but only EUR 12 million, as I just said. The risk provisions that on top of the overlay had to be booked in the U.S. with only single-digit number. So that was related to the one new NPL that we have here.\nMarc Hess: Yes. And as to your second question. As I've mentioned, the transaction volume has been somewhat low in the first quarter. We're not seeing a lot of pick up in the second quarter. So when you're competing and looking for the right risk return, at this point in time, sometimes you get presented or you find right projects. And sometimes, you don't want to compete because maybe these projects are not [indiscernible] return for risk perspective. As you have seen with the figures, we've been very successful in selecting very favorable transactions during the first quarter. And if you were to ask me, what will you tell me, Christof, when we're here in the second quarter call, I would tell you that our pipeline at this point in time has grown very substantially and that by the end of the second quarter, you would be very pleased with the reported figures when it comes to the expected new business as well as the risk return that we are catching to it. So maybe that as much as a view going forward till the end of June. The second thing is, as we've said in the first quarter, EUR 500 million were renewals and EUR 600 million was new business. And that is actually quite good and not to affect because why would -- why [indiscernible] finance on the balance sheet either with the sale. And as we just mentioned, the transaction volume was rather low. So that doesn't happen that often. The second thing is that a lot of boards don't want to sell at these times and will extend with you in order to have a better, more opportune selling time down the future and also in the U.S., just to ramp that up. On these extensions we are, especially in U.S., able to receive further security and downpayments with largely increased spreads. So overall, I would say that the renewal business is probably at least as attractive as the new business, if not more, because the board also for those certain costs and this certainly would have, if we were to transfer and go to another bank. So I think it's a win-win for both sides and overall both walk off quite confident.\nJohannes Thormann: Sorry, if I may add 2 follow-up questions on this. Christof, you said you're not seeing a pickup of transactions in the market [indiscernible] grown substantially. So the growth in the pipeline is just from prolongations and what is driving this? And the second thing is on the renewal business. If you say the margins are -- business is as attractive as the really new business. Are the margins on the same level?\nChristof Winkelmann: Yes, absolutely. So what is going the pipeline? It would be very nice if I could pick and choose which kind of assets are on the market for an acquisition finance or refinance in other banks at all times. So it is a bit dependent on when these transactions come to market. And if they come to market, they're looking especially in these times for surety of execution, for expertise, and reliability. And we have been working in parallel to doing the business on building that pipeline with those transactions that are requiring the expertise that we have set out to do that we have in-house when it comes to different asset classes, when it comes to, of course, order portfolios, crosscut arise, very granular. And it also depends on what kind of buyer is currently buying. So in these markets, usually buyers that need less leverage are very substantial in value network. Those are the buyers. So they come along and increment and unfortunately always [indiscernible] when you want them. So the pipeline going forward, we're telling you, is nearly that pattern as compared to nearly new, new business, new business origination. In parallel, to the second question on the prolongations. As I've said, it is an economic mathematical exercise because, again, if you transfer your loan to another bank, there are certain cost risks and time associated with it. So what I can say is that with approximately the same risk parameters, we would be getting, let's call it, a couple of hands or more full of basis points above new business because the cost, as I said, are dispersed. So as I said, it's very attractive to us to follow this business. It is not second class on the contrary, I think at this point in time, I would love to have more of those just because we know these assets. We've had them for a while and our Board is committed.\nOperator: The next question comes from Timo Dums from DZ Bank.\nTimo Dums: Thank you for taking my question and also for sharing the additional details on the U.S. and office portfolio. So starting with the takeover, could you maybe share with us a little bit more details or color on why the ECB approval has not been granted yet, looking at the other authorities that have been moving already? Then secondly, on NII, I mean, you've also tried a strong increase and you're in the big countries and also going forward and basically announced that you may end up above the range of EUR million to EUR million. Could you maybe provide us with sort of an NII trajectory further going down the road? Because when I just annualize this quarterly results, I'm really well above the target range. Then on my last question is then on the NPL this total or the acceleration that you announced in the previous quarter. So the presentation says that you have already started the process. Could you give some more color and also how we should think about the EUR 60 million in the account [indiscernible] this is sufficient between the top-up that amount or how we should think about that?\nJochen Klosges: Yes. Timo, thanks for the question. Let me start with the question on takeover, and then I will try to answer also your question number 3 about NPL, and I guess Marc will take care of the question regarding the net interest income trajectory. So takeover, to be pretty honest, this is -- you know that a process between the investors and the authorities. So that is usual to all have this in minds. I guess -- so it's a huge success so far that the investors who are able to receive all the necessary approvals so far except of the ECB, but this is something which is -- which seems to be seems to be something like a standard process. But basically the ECB is the final one who grant them the approval. Everybody knows that the promised update is the 24th of May. The ECB has to check everything in detail. It's from our regulatory and potential point of view, something which is also, let's say, put it that way, create extra work for the teams within the ECB. So we are here pretty confident and share the point of view of our investors that there will be a decision until the 24th of May. And so finally, I guess, it is kind of normal setting we are currently in. And let's see what's going to be the outcome. But as I already mentioned in my speech, everybody is pretty confident that there will be a positive decision finally. However, it's the call of the ECB. And so, I guess, I would like to tell you more about this, but we need to be cautious and see things going on here. Regarding the NPL, I must say and I'll take a look at Christof as well. I guess when we introduced the extra budget of EUR 16 million back in early March, so nothing really new has happened since then. Our view is unchanged. We are trying to use that amount of money to reduce our NPLs further. We are working currently on a number of transaction activities. But please forgive me that I won't tell you something about details, that won't be really favorable for our prices, in that case, obviously. But finally, I can only say our view has not really changed since early March. That's what I want to say to NPL. Marc, over to you regarding the net interest income.\nMarc Hess: Yes. Thank you for your questions. I mean, this is difficult to answer because I've already given you guidance. And of course, hopefully understanding that I'm not going to be much more precise. I think it's obvious the upper range of our target of EUR 170 million is well in reach, and there is a good likelihood that finally we will be above that line. Will it be, let's say, 4x the number that we have seen in Q1? Well, probably not really. I think we have always guided that we expect some kind of outflow on the deposits, EUR 13 billion is our target. You have seen we were at EUR 13.7 billion. This has several federal resources. One is the USF reform where we see some adjustments on the client side. The other one is, as we explained that many of our depositors from the housing industry, they accumulated buffers with the energy crisis and everything other than, let's say, second half of last year. We also here, we expect the kind of normalization. So that's one factor. And the other thing, you have seen that the rate increase, especially since September was really accelerated at the market, and it's always a little bit [indiscernible] let's say, to adjust the rates paid on the deposits. So all in all, as I just said, I'm very optimistic. But please, I hope for your understanding that I will not be more precise in giving you a guidance here for a year-end number in net interest income.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Stuart Graham from Autonomous Research LLP.\nStuart Graham: I have one bigger picture question and two [indiscernible] number questions, please. The bigger picture question is, how important do you think the likely credit curtailment from U.S. regional banks is going to be in U.S. office valuations as you know they're major financiers in U.S. office? And giving their own problems, they're likely to be cutting credit, I would imagine. That's the first question. Then my two [indiscernible] number questions again on the U.S. office, apologies. First, how much of the EUR 3.8 billion is currently classified as Stage 2 or Stage 3? And then second, how large is the stock of provisions, including the EUR 21 million overlay against the EUR 3.8 billion CRE of exposure, please?\nJochen Klosges: Second question will be answered by Marc. And first one will be answered by Christof and myself. So my view is if I take a look at the banking landscape in the U.S. that the current issues over there are pretty much connected to regional banks, which have been doing financing, regional commercial properties in their local neighborhoods. And therefore, I guess, there is hopefully a very limited spread to the development concerning banks, which have usually the exposures in the big metropolitan areas and plus allocations with Class A properties. So that's to be, pretty honest, I'm not really capable to judge the quality of the portfolio of these regional banks in the U.S., across the country. In terms of how could that development spread over to values of properties we [indiscernible] I would like to hand over to Christof.\nChristof Winkelmann: Yes. As Jochen was indicating, we have to look at what the regional banks, first of all, what is the regional bank and what are they financing. There was one bank that was located on the East Coast. And to my understanding, is a big bank. However, when it comes to real estate and/or commercial real estate, the average loan size was a single-digit million figure. And not located mostly in Manhattan -- like this. So I think that the regional banks will probably have more an effect on these kind of assets, more regional, small in size, I'm not saying that a retail bank can finance a larger building. But the clear majority will probably be more in regional assets and smaller size, whereas the Manhattan is mostly taken care of more of the super banks, the large banks, large insurance companies, debt funds, and [indiscernible] structures. So if you would ask me what is the impact. For the time being, we have not seen an impact. I'm not saying there can't be any impact, but I don't believe that that will be major towards the commercial real estate that we finance.\nStuart Graham: Sorry, I'm just asking negative questions, apologies.\nJochen Klosges: Not a problem.\nChristof Winkelmann: So look, for the total U.S. portfolio of EUR 3.9 billion, we currently have in stage , but let me remind all of you that indicates a relative dilution, on the relative dilution to the initial parameters who were very good, and it doesn't tell you about the absolute risk profile, which is still good. We have 4% in Stage 3, so around EUR 160 million of the office NPLs that you can see here on that page is U.S.-related. And for Stage 1 and 2, the total risk provisioning is EUR 38 million.\nStuart Graham: Sorry, the 38% number, what was that? That was stage 2?\nMarc Hess: The 38% was Stage 2, 4% in Stage 3 and the EUR 38 million risk provision that is for Stage 1 and 2, including the management ofâ€¦\nStuart Graham: And then there would be some provisions on the 200 million NPLs as well, yes?\nMarc Hess: Yeah, of course, provision on the EUR 150 million NPL that is around a little bit more than EUR 10 million.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. And I now hand back to Jurgen Junginger for closing comments.\nJurgen Junginger: All right. Thank you for joining the conference call. And I think it was a really good conversation, really good discussion, really good questions we get from you. And as always, we are happy to take on follow-up questions. Thanks again. Have a good day and bye-bye.\nJochen Klosges: Thank you, everybody. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded, and you may disconnect your telephone. Thank you very much for joining, and have a pleasant day. Goodbye.",

    "fullTranscript": "Joyce Kwock: [Call Starts Abruptly] the name before asking questions. And we also provide a simultaneous interpreting and you can click on the interpreting button. Next, let's take a look at the results in the first half of this year. In the first half of the year, the Group's revenue was RMB9.22 billion, down 2% year-on-year. Against the backdrop of uncertainties in the global macroeconomy, the Group made a steady progress, continuously improved operational efficiency and the cash flow and its business diversification strategy achieved initial results. The GP margin was 14.1%, down 4.8 percentage points year-on-year, due to the weak demand in the global smartphone market in the first quarter, but the Q-on-Q GP margin improved significantly in the second quarter. The net profit was RMB150 million a year-on-year decrease of 57.1%. And in the first half, the Group's operating cash flow was RMB2.05 billion, year-on-year increase of 43.1%. The book cash was RMB7.13 billion, which was the same as that of last year. And the net gearing ratio was 4.9%, which was 1.3 percentage points lower than 2022. The CapEx was RMB616 million, which was 42% lower than 2022. And inventory days decreased to 90 days compared with 109 days at the end of 2022. The company will continue to allocate CapEx and control expenses based on the long-term growth targets to ensure there is sufficient cash to support the long-term development of the Group's business. Next, I'd like to share with you the performance of different business segments. Acoustics, in the first half, the revenue of the acoustics business was RMB3.32 billion, year-on-year decrease of the 19.9%, mainly due to the global smartphone market demand recovered less than expected in the first half, resulting in year-on-year decline in shipment volume. The GP margin was 25.5%, down 1.7 percentage points year-on-year, mainly due to the decline in shipment volume of caused by weak demand in the Android market in first quarter and increase in unit cost caused by the drop in the shipments. In the first half of the year, the demand recovery of the Android market still faced some pressure, which had a certain negative impact on the Group's Android related business. But however, thanks to years of close cooperation with overseas customers, the Group has maintained relatively stable market share and continue to support customers' expansion in the technological innovation. And in the first half of the year, acoustics solution, integrating a full set of audio system design services was launched to create an immersive sound experience for users. In the first half, the Group's optics business achieved revenue of RMB1.77 billion, year-on-year decrease of 4.4%, mainly due to weak market demand and the pressure on unit prices in the first quarter. Revenue on the GP margin improved significantly in the second quarter, mainly due to the increase in market demand shipments and the slowdown in unit price competition. We will continue to implement high end strategy to optimize products structure and gain market share through technology upgrading. And the plastic lens, the proportion of the 6P products shipments has increased to more than 10% of the total plastic lens, improving the ASP. And we also have the OIS module, WLG hybrid lens is progressing smoothly and the related array lenses, cylindricals and prisms make their debut at the 2023 Shanghai Mobile World Congress.  In terms of VR, the Group's 3P Pancake optomechanical module successfully achieved mass production during the period. The Group has also achieved deployed industrial lenses and achieved sales breakthroughs from zero to one in industrial inspection.  Now we will pay attention to the emerging division of electromagnetic drive, EMD, and the precision mechanics segments. In the first half, the revenue was RMB3.62 billion, up 23.4% year-on-year. And the EMD business increased steadily. The metal casing business increased significantly, and the market share of the laptops business increased. The GP margin of the combined segment was 19.3%, down by 1.2 percentage points. In the first half of the 2023 Group's market share among overseas market remained stable and the market share further increased. The shipment volume of entry motor products increased by 63.2% year-on-year with higher performance in start-stop speed and the Group's motor products also continue to extend to the non-mobile phone builds.  In the first half, the Group's metal casing business continued to expand and maintain a leading market share and Toyo Precision still achieved good performance on the laptop side and the Yangzhou Phase II factory started smoothly and will further enhance the contribution of laptop revenue.  Finally, let's pay attention to the sensor and the semiconductor business together. And the revenue of sensor and the semiconductor business was RMB494 million, up 3.2% year-on-year, mainly due to the increase in shipments. The GP margin was 11.3%, down 2.4 percentage points year-on-year mainly due to the decline of ASP brought about by intensified competition. In the first half, the production capacity of the Malaysian factory gradually ramped up. And in terms of the automotive builds, the Group has successfully developed a complete set of new auto MEMS, microphone modules.  After sharing the financial performance of each business segment, let's take a look at the strategic development of the Group. The Group continues to lift the smartphone market experience upgrades. Its products include the high performance x-axis haptics linear motor which has been used by Samsung Galaxy A/S23, OPPO Reno 10, Vivo X90, and SLS, super linear speaker has been used by Xiaomi 13 Ultra and other model. OnePlus 11 adapted to dual speaker box with the proprietary NLC low-frequency algorithm. Xiaomi Civi and Mi and the Mix Fold 3 are equipped with 1G6P outer transparent WLG lenses. And also the flag -- in some -- the flagship and high-end models of some major customers, the business of the metal casing market share is increasing. And the Group will adhere to the high-end metal casing and the Group also made customized hinge, in real life that’s extremely thin, sturdy and a reliable folding experience. Group also provides customers with ultra-thin and the super large average temperature plates and participated in the research and development of annular cold-pumping heat dissipation technologies, which greatly improves the heat efficient capacity of smartphones.  In terms of automotive acoustic, and the President [indiscernible] will make the introduction. \nUnidentified Company Representative : And I thank you, Joyce. And I'd like to talk about the automotive acoustics. Our target of the automotive customers is to provide the haptic experience to our end users and the customers. So based on this concept, AAC pay attention to the amplifier and algorithm, as well as the systematic development. So we continuous accumulate the experience and make innovation of technology progress.  So -- and this background -- and we think AAC has achieved the leading position in the integrated solution of the automotive acoustics. So apart from Hanon, only few companies have been equipped with such probability, and we also propose the acquisition of PSS. So I would like to introduce PSS. So PSS has done over 50 years of sound solution technology leadership, and here's its history's a quick look from these headquarters in Belgium. And there are over 300 engineers globally. Their focus is on the automotive acoustics, and there are four highlights. First of all, the leadership in the technology, in the automotive acoustic systems and mark that they are market leader in EV and the PHEV, as well as the traditional vehicles, and also provided the advanced products in the market. In addition, apart from the traditional vehicles on auto companies, the OEMs, as well as the new NEVs and the new EVs, and they are also their customers. Certainly we think it's also very important, because they serve the automotive companies globally and they have a very good layout and distribution in the world. Last but not least, its financial performance, and the PSS revenue is about €450 million. And we think the revenue will grow in the future. In terms of the revenue, the orders will continue by three to five years. So in the next three to five years, the growing momentum will be maintained and it will also be triggered by these new automakers. In addition, they have great momentum in the innovation with their proprietary technologies and those technologies and innovation will boost the profits. So we think PSS has a great potential in the future growth. In the strategic rationale for the application of PSS, PSS is a sizeable and leading white label automotive speaker manufacturer. And this will make a supplement to AAC. They supply directly to global OEMs, and it is also leading supplier to global audio brands. And secondly, they have a strategic diversification. By acquiring a business with existing skill and operation, AAC achieves meaningful strategic diversification through one transaction, certainly vertical integration. With cooperation with PSS, and we can make a breakthrough in the speakers and amplifiers as well as some products in optics to grab additional value share.  Fourthly is the synergistic opportunities. Moreover the transaction enables AAC to leverage its operational expertise in supply chain and the China market to tap the growth of the global automotive acoustics and EV markets. The reasonable transaction structure, the proposed deal structure enables AAC to retain and effectively motivate the existing key management team, a small part retained in the part of the management. And this will become the incentives for the management and to lead the graph of AAC. And last but not least, the risk mitigation, the retention of existing management mitigates significant due diligence risk and boosts confidence in the execution future business plans.  So the six highlights, the six rationales the main considerations for us to acquire PSS.  PSS product portfolio. The main product is speaker, and then it meets full range, mid-range speakers and woofers, et cetera, and tweeters et cetera. And they will also provide the speakers to the consuming customers. They also have other three segments. The first one is related acoustic system. The first one is about the speaker systems and above, the subwoofer and also the door boxes and headrest solutions, 3D solutions. And they can put this speaker in differed sizes. And so it's more compatible in the automotive. And certainly it's about the safety speakers and the systems. So with the EV's growth, it's very important for the AVAS, the Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System. So this is the requirement for installation in the EVs. And after the acquisition, and we can also -- innovation products. And fourthly is the transducer based haptic systems. Many people are talking about the 3D, and 4D and also, for example, more on haptics experience to our customers. And the PSS has achieved a mass production on those regards on the entertainment and infotainment. So this is a perfect combination of acoustics and optics. So those are the four core business parts or segments of PSS. And the PSS global operational footprint. As I mentioned before, its headquarter is in Belgium. It was founded in Belgium, and those are the main factories. And Mexico factory is mainly serving the U.S. market. And they also have factories in Germany and Hungary. And those are serving the European automotive market, and in Dongguan and Penang in Malaysia for the Chinese markets and the Asian and the global customers. The R&D center is in Belgium and Shenzhen. So those are the R&D centers. You can see from this map, PSS has complete global operational footprint, and they have already established industrial supply chain to serve all the automotives worldwide.  So to close this brief introduction of PSS, and we can come to Q&A session. And thank you. \nUnidentified Company Representative : Thank you on this close introduction.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from CICC.\nHu Peng: I have two questions. And the first question is related to the mobile phone. So you can see the pressure or the price pressure of the mobile phone in the first half of the year. So I'm curious about the long-term strategy of the -- or your view on the long-term demand of the mobile phone. And we also see the recovery or the coming back of Shenzhen customer. So whether this will boost any demand? And also what's the price strategy? My second question is about the optimistic -- is about the optics and inventory. What's your outlook on the inventory on optics business? So I have these two questions. \nUnidentified Company Representative : Okay. Regarding the mobile phone market, yes. In the first half of the year, the shipments of volumes, there’s decline compared with the first half of last year. The whole year, we think the 1.2 billion shipment volumes of last year will decrease to 1.1 billion shipment volume this year.  In terms of the supply chain, based on our understanding of our customers for having raised levels are low as far as we know. So the forecast for the second half of the year will be accurate -- will be more accurate, and the volatilities will not be as big as that of the last year. So this is about the shipments volume for this year. And most customers are targeting on high value products. The models below 1000 or 2000 decreased and many users focused on the models above 2000 or even higher. And we also see the new launch of the mobile phone models and the new models will trigger the upgrade of their system and their models. So in the first quarter and the second quarter, our shipments will be at the low level. But in the second half of the year, the shipments volume will be ramped up compared with the first half. And this market will be more stable and they are value oriented.  Acoustics. The ASP will be lower in the first half. But the second half, the ASP will increase from 4.5 to above 5. It's related to the new models and new components upgrades. And from the perspective of shipments volume, the first half is about 40% to 45% of the total year's shipments volume. So the second half, the volume will be about 50% to 55%, 10% to 15% increase compared with the first half. This profitability in the second half will be increased, especially for the Android system.  And also the production capacity and utilization is increasing, as well as the precision mechanics. And metal casing, of course, this kind of growth was triggered by the Shenzhen customer. And we are developing the collaboration with this customer. We also have the promotion on the high end models. For the precision mechanics, we have very positive feedback compared with the first half of the year. We believe the top-line and the revenue will be increased by 10% to 15% in the second half. The production capacity and utilization as well as their capacity will be increased.  So overall, the mobile smartphone market will develop according to this value base. And we'll be benefiting from this development.  In terms of OpEx and Jack will answer your question. \nJack Duan : So your question is in two parts, the first one is about the average rate. So as of the -- as of to-date, our inventory level is about three months and delivery on operational parts are split up. It's about two weeks to three weeks. And for our very cool inventory, we are destocking. Therefore, the inventory level will be maintained at a very front level compared with last year. The completed products inventory is up by 15% and [MPF] is also market height.  Your second question is about the future outlook. In the second half, our company is more focused on the high end lens. In the first half, for example, the 6P shipments volume accounted for 15% of our total shipments volume. And in the second half, this number will increase. It is in line with our high end products strategy. As mentioned by Kelvin, our customers are returned to the high end and to better experience our products. Our GP margin is increasing. The ASP has declined and this kind of decline will be paused, will be stopped. And this is also beneficial to our second half. And in terms of the inventory, we don't have any inventory in modules and the modules production is based on the orders, and we adjusted the inventory and the production according to the production. We will increase the turnover days, and we will also achieve the cash and inflow positive. And this will help us to maintain a strong cash position.  In a nutshell, we will destock our inventory based on the market demand and to achieve a sound financial position and cash inflow. \nOperator: The next question is from CITIC.\nTao Xu: In the first half, the optics was better than acoustics. What's the difference? What's the reason? It is the year-on-year growth is different. So this is the first question.  And the second question is about the folded smartphone. And we also see a lot of mass production. So what's our value chain on this folded smartphone? And apart from the Beijing customers, do you have any potential expansion market? \nKelvin Pan: From this acoustics perspective, you can see there's large decline in the inventory. So in the first half, the shipments of the acoustics and the ASP and this unit price, the unit price declined by 10% to 15%. And we think in the second half as a unit price will recover to that last year or above that. So that's why we can see this pressure of the acoustics in the first half and so production utilization is not to reach 100%. So we have reduced it to 390 million products, and our target is 800 million, and the unit price will be increased by 20%. So you can see in the second half of the year, this will be boosted and according to the shipments of these two months. And we think these shipments in the second half of the year can reach 450,000 and ASP can reach 5. So this will help us return acoustics to a sound development. That's also the reason why you see the optics performance is better than acoustics in the first half.  And second question is the folded smartphone. Indeed, we have reached with some mass production and the delivery on the -- on our products from Huawei. I think the potential is great and high end smartphone's price is about 10,000 and the smaller phone -- smartphone is about 7,000. And for these high-end products -- and product -- for this turning axis, the price is about 500. We think this year we can produce 300,000 to 500,000. So it's also based on the customers' demand and we think this kind of development is promising, and we are developing the market with more customers. When we have further information, we'll disclose those to all the investors. And we can also see there's a greater potential in this turning axis products. And we see these attitudes -- these very good attitudes toward those high-end.\nTao Xu: Thank you. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, management. \nOperator: And next question is about -- Alex from BOCI. \nAlex Lin: Thank you, management. I have two questions. The first question is about the next three to five year strategy on mobile phone and non-mobile phone. And second question is the automotive acoustics. You are planning to acquire PSS. I want to know the timeline -- specific timeline? In the future, do you have any guidelines for the revenue of acquired PSS and what kind of potential it'll bring about to AAC in the automotive market? Certainly PSS has collaboration with the biggest clients, T clients. But after the acquisition, in terms of an optics motor investor company, have more a potential in their global customer base. So my question is about the overall company's strategy. \nKelvin Pan: I think in terms of the size of the mobile phone -- and this will be slowed down, but the value, for example, the high value products, high-end products with rich functions and experience will be further developed. And therefore ACC, we need to catch this opportunity to cover all of our business, including these models in optics and acoustics, and then we can provide the higher end products to our customers and proceed this upgrading opportunity to increase our revenue and the profits. So this is about the smartphone area.  In terms of the automotive, many people curious about the development of acoustics in AAC. On the PSS, the revenue in 2022 is about €450 million to €500 million. And this will be in our consolidated balance sheet. So in the automotive, the revenue is of equivalent scale of our electronic acoustics. So apart from the acoustics, we can also develop our other business, for example, the non-optics as well as MEMS microphone and automotive motor. And we can make breakthroughs on this regard.  On the -- on this acoustics, automotive acoustic size, we want to reach the target of the same scale in the consumer electronics. PSS has a lot of customers in the U.S. Apart from the U.S., the traditional automakers, as well as the big clients, T clients, they are long-term customers. And this good relation, customer relation are very helpful to AAC, amplifier and the speakers and the other components. And AAC can leverage the PSS and to expand the market. So those are the strategic value of the PSS.\nOperator: Thank you, Alex, for question. Next question is from Wil Zou from First Shanghai. \nWilson Zou: Thank you. My first question is about the ASP of the optic lens in the Q2. So, what's the structural optimization? In the future, the GP margin of optics will become positive. When does it happen?\nUnidentified Company Representative: And the lens restructuring started last year, and this was triggered by the customers' demand in the 5P and 6P and there's kind of verification need in the time. So after verification, high-end product started a mass production and ramped up its production. And this volume has increased by over 10%. In the second half of the year, we will continue to optimize this structure and more 6P products will enter the market. Sorry, I forgot your second question.\nWilson Zou: My second question is about the processing lens, net processing, and also the margin profit, and it's about 15% to 16%, the processing ratio is 15% to 16%.\nUnidentified Company Representative: And the GP margin includes two parts, and the first is about lens, and the margin of lens is negative 10%. We think this growth will turn positive in the second half. And with our deployment on the high-end product, as well as the smart introduction of actions within the company and the technology upgrades, we then estimate in Q4 the optical lens business will gain positive profits.  In terms of the module, this is the second part, the second half, the competition in the second half will become mild. So we think the module GP margin will also turn positive in the second half.\nWilson Zou: My second part, and it's about the Toyo Precision and what's the production capacity?\nUnidentified Company Representative: And after the acquisition of Toyo, the Yangzhou factory, and this year starts its mass production, and the first product will be delivered in Q3 and Q4 and the total production capacity of the factory is estimated of 100,000 to 150,000 pieces. And in Q3, this capacity can reach 15% because we have one project running on it, and there will be more projects onwards. And in the second half, the Yangzhou factory will make some contributions. But it depends on the market demand because the laptop demand is declining this year. So we have to make adjustments on the production according to the customer demand. And the first product has already reached mass production and deliveries. And after the acquisition of Toyo, this benefited to the Group. And after the first product -- in the future, after the first product, the future projects will be ramped up. \nWilson Zou : And for a single slice what unit price? \nUnidentified Company Representative : The single slice for total is 100 to 120. And the Yangzhou factory is about 300 because, it's the precision -- precise process and not a stamping product. \nOperator: And the next question is from [indiscernible]. \nUnidentified Analyst: The question is about the market share of PSS and the book cash, and the revenue of PSS as well and then the market share of PSS? \nUnidentified Company Representative : It's about 15% to 25%. In the high-end speakers, this market share will become larger, higher. So, in the total, speakers, its market share is about 15% to 20%.  In terms of financial, I invite Ms. Dan Guo to answer. \nDan Guo: Okay. I'll answer all the questions on the chat box. The top line is about 450 million to 500 million annually, and it will grow annually. The growth is about -- growth is stable and the GP margin is 20%, and profit margin is 5% to 8%. In the future as we mentioned before and the synergies will come from the cross-selling of the products into the whole supply chain, including the overall production line and operational efficiency. So we think there are still potentials in the future growth. And in terms of the book cash, the net cash is about €10 million to €15 million. And debt, the operating debt is shorter, it's about €50 million to €60 million.\nOperator: Next question is from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: I have two questions. The first two questions is about our big customers in Shenzhen and in Q3 they will launch new models. So I'd like to know more about the preparation on the ASP and the market share. And the second question is about the U.S. big client. Do you have any upgrade on this?\nUnidentified Company Representative: In terms of the big client in Shenzhen, they cast their products focused on the high-end, and we have close collaboration with them and we will elaborate their market development. So the ASP is -- the metal casing as well as the acoustics and the motors, they have higher margins. Their requirements on the ASP, as well as the requirements are higher because their requirement is higher. So the ASP is a 20% to 30% higher than the market price, because it's more customized. And apart from this year's demand, the customers -- future demand is also huge. Therefore, we will forge our collaboration with customer to help them to upgrade the immersive experience. The specific figures depend on the market situation.  In terms of the U.S. customer, in the first half, there are some voices in the market that the company will cancel the motor function. But we think there are still opportunities, but this will be delayed. And the function will be promoted in the future and then maybe post this year or delayed this year, but it will be promoted in the future. And we are paying a close attention to their investment and we can continue to support its R&D and the development on this function.\nOperator: The next question is from [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst: The question is about CapEx and the guidance in the second half of this year and the next year. CapEx of this year is in line with CapEx disclosed before. Before is about 1.85 billion, and the CapEx will reduce by 15%. So CapEx this year is about 1.5 billion. Of course, it depends on our overseas markets plan, other strategies. Or add some information here?\nUnidentified Company Representative : And for our traditional and owned products, the cost is more optimized. So there will not to be any capacity expansion on the traditional products. For our investment, for example, there small functions upgrade via smartphones, for example, the hinge, the new x-axis haptics motor and upgrade. The high value-added components will be the investing areas. But for the owned and traditional mass producing parts, the investment will not be increased. In addition, we also see the separation or the fragmented supply chain of our customers. And we can support these customers and from our overseas factories, and it'll help our customers to mitigate the tax or risks. And thirdly, the CapEx will be on the strategic development, for example, the acquisition of PSS. And in the automotives we will continue our investments. For example, the innovative and automotive speakers or/and the amplifiers and microphones, as well as the automotive optic lens.  So apart from PSS acquisition, AAC will make continuous CapEx in the own automotives business. So the CapEx target this year has already covered all this development. And in the future, we will continue to optimize our cash flow in the mobile phone production line and to achieve a stable business development. And we will efficiently control on our CapEx, but we maintain our investments in innovation. \nOperator: Our time is constrained. And this will be the last question. And the last question is from [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst : Thank you management for this opportunity. I have two questions. The first question is about the precision mechanics. We see 40% increase in the laptops and et cetera. And with the return of the Shenzhen customer, the precision mechanics will become better. On acoustics and the motor and other business segments, do you have any revenue targets? My second question is, how do you see the recovery of the Android market and any upgrade potential in the second half of the year?\nUnidentified Company Representative: And the precision mechanics is very good. And this is related to the Shenzhen customer's cooperation. And what we also see is on high-end model's development. And even these middle end products, we will introduce metal casing and this will become the industrial trend and the overall industry are developing into the mid and high end performance and products. And also the holding and haptics experience is very important. And therefore I think the metal casing will be promoted.  And for the first half of the year, the production capacity, for example, has reached it full capacity. We even need find the third-party partner to expand our capacity. This is good news. And next year in this kind of momentum will be maintained, I believe. The metal casing next year has another increasing point, which is hinge. In Q2 and Q3, we will have our first mass production. And in the second half and the next year, there will be more products. And Android market will use the hinge products as the edge for the -- starting point for the new market. So with the launch of the new hinge smartphones -- and you can see this shipment volumes has created lot, for example, the Shenzhen big clients and the other clients.  So hinge, as its market and its high price -- high unit price, it's a very pivotal structural support. And this will increase the performance of the smartphones and also reduce its weight. And certainly it's about the projects in Yangzhou after the M&A of Toyo and the metal casing for laptops are the focus of Yangzhou factory. Then we think next year and the year after next year, there will be more projects into the mass production in precision mechanics. Profitability and revenue will increase significantly very clear in the precision mechanics segment. So what's your second part of your question? \nUnidentified Analyst : My second question is about the revenue guidance or any upgrade potential in Android market? \nUnidentified Company Representative : Acoustics, motor and the precision mechanics will keep the high-end momentum and their products will be optimized in accordance with this high-end momentum. So we think motor can maintain 20% to 30% unit growth. The mobile phone has steady demand and haptic demand has haptics requirement. And this -- our new motors showed the better performance. And this is also price -- high price to performance ratio, a choice to our customer. And the customer will have a very immediate experience upgrade, for example, SLS and these big acoustics volume products will help meet in high-end customers to upgrade. And we'll increase the quality of sounds as well as the volume.  In the metal casing, as I mentioned before, this middle end mobile phone will use more metal casing as well as the folded mobile phone. And they will help us to increase our top line and the bottom line with the stable production utilization and stable market and all the production line will return to sound level.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Due to the constrained time, this is the end of the 2023 interim results. And our materials has already been uploaded to the official website. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact IR team. Thank you.",

Next, let's take a look at the results in the first half of this year. In the first half of the year, the Group's revenue was RMB9.22 billion, down 2% year-on-year. Against the backdrop of uncertainties in the global macroeconomy, the Group made a steady progress, continuously improved operational efficiency and the cash flow and its business diversification strategy achieved initial results. The GP margin was 14.1%, down 4.8 percentage points year-on-year, due to the weak demand in the global smartphone market in the first quarter, but the Q-on-Q GP margin improved significantly in the second quarter. The net profit was RMB150 million a year-on-year decrease of 57.1%. And in the first half, the Group's operating cash flow was RMB2.05 billion, year-on-year increase of 43.1%. The book cash was RMB7.13 billion, which was the same as that of last year. And the net gearing ratio was 4.9%, which was 1.3 percentage points lower than 2022. The CapEx was RMB616 million, which was 42% lower than 2022. And inventory days decreased to 90 days compared with 109 days at the end of 2022. The company will continue to allocate CapEx and control expenses based on the long-term growth targets to ensure there is sufficient cash to support the long-term development of the Group's business. Next, I'd like to share with you the performance of different business segments. Acoustics, in the first half, the revenue of the acoustics business was RMB3.32 billion, year-on-year decrease of the 19.9%, mainly due to the global smartphone market demand recovered less than expected in the first half, resulting in year-on-year decline in shipment volume. The GP margin was 25.5%, down 1.7 percentage points year-on-year, mainly due to the decline in shipment volume of caused by weak demand in the Android market in first quarter and increase in unit cost caused by the drop in the shipments. In the first half of the year, the demand recovery of the Android market still faced some pressure, which had a certain negative impact on the Group's Android related business. But however, thanks to years of close cooperation with overseas customers, the Group has maintained relatively stable market share and continue to support customers' expansion in the technological innovation. And in the first half of the year, acoustics solution, integrating a full set of audio system design services was launched to create an immersive sound experience for users. In the first half, the Group's optics business achieved revenue of RMB1.77 billion, year-on-year decrease of 4.4%, mainly due to weak market demand and the pressure on unit prices in the first quarter. Revenue on the GP margin improved significantly in the second quarter, mainly due to the increase in market demand shipments and the slowdown in unit price competition. We will continue to implement high end strategy to optimize products structure and gain market share through technology upgrading. And the plastic lens, the proportion of the 6P products shipments has increased to more than 10% of the total plastic lens, improving the ASP. And we also have the OIS module, WLG hybrid lens is progressing smoothly and the related array lenses, cylindricals and prisms make their debut at the 2023 Shanghai Mobile World Congress.  In terms of VR, the Group's 3P Pancake optomechanical module successfully achieved mass production during the period. The Group has also achieved deployed industrial lenses and achieved sales breakthroughs from zero to one in industrial inspection.  Now we will pay attention to the emerging division of electromagnetic drive, EMD, and the precision mechanics segments. In the first half, the revenue was RMB3.62 billion, up 23.4% year-on-year. And the EMD business increased steadily. The metal casing business increased significantly, and the market share of the laptops business increased. The GP margin of the combined segment was 19.3%, down by 1.2 percentage points. In the first half of the 2023 Group's market share among overseas market remained stable and the market share further increased. The shipment volume of entry motor products increased by 63.2% year-on-year with higher performance in start-stop speed and the Group's motor products also continue to extend to the non-mobile phone builds.  In the first half, the Group's metal casing business continued to expand and maintain a leading market share and Toyo Precision still achieved good performance on the laptop side and the Yangzhou Phase II factory started smoothly and will further enhance the contribution of laptop revenue.  Finally, let's pay attention to the sensor and the semiconductor business together. And the revenue of sensor and the semiconductor business was RMB494 million, up 3.2% year-on-year, mainly due to the increase in shipments. The GP margin was 11.3%, down 2.4 percentage points year-on-year mainly due to the decline of ASP brought about by intensified competition. In the first half, the production capacity of the Malaysian factory gradually ramped up. And in terms of the automotive builds, the Group has successfully developed a complete set of new auto MEMS, microphone modules.  After sharing the financial performance of each business segment, let's take a look at the strategic development of the Group. The Group continues to lift the smartphone market experience upgrades. Its products include the high performance x-axis haptics linear motor which has been used by Samsung Galaxy A/S23, OPPO Reno 10, Vivo X90, and SLS, super linear speaker has been used by Xiaomi 13 Ultra and other model. OnePlus 11 adapted to dual speaker box with the proprietary NLC low-frequency algorithm. Xiaomi Civi and Mi and the Mix Fold 3 are equipped with 1G6P outer transparent WLG lenses. And also the flag -- in some -- the flagship and high-end models of some major customers, the business of the metal casing market share is increasing. And the Group will adhere to the high-end metal casing and the Group also made customized hinge, in real life that’s extremely thin, sturdy and a reliable folding experience. Group also provides customers with ultra-thin and the super large average temperature plates and participated in the research and development of annular cold-pumping heat dissipation technologies, which greatly improves the heat efficient capacity of smartphones.  In terms of automotive acoustic, and the President [indiscernible] will make the introduction. \nUnidentified Company Representative : And I thank you, Joyce. And I'd like to talk about the automotive acoustics. Our target of the automotive customers is to provide the haptic experience to our end users and the customers. So based on this concept, AAC pay attention to the amplifier and algorithm, as well as the systematic development. So we continuous accumulate the experience and make innovation of technology progress.  So -- and this background -- and we think AAC has achieved the leading position in the integrated solution of the automotive acoustics. So apart from Hanon, only few companies have been equipped with such probability, and we also propose the acquisition of PSS. So I would like to introduce PSS. So PSS has done over 50 years of sound solution technology leadership, and here's its history's a quick look from these headquarters in Belgium. And there are over 300 engineers globally. Their focus is on the automotive acoustics, and there are four highlights. First of all, the leadership in the technology, in the automotive acoustic systems and mark that they are market leader in EV and the PHEV, as well as the traditional vehicles, and also provided the advanced products in the market. In addition, apart from the traditional vehicles on auto companies, the OEMs, as well as the new NEVs and the new EVs, and they are also their customers. Certainly we think it's also very important, because they serve the automotive companies globally and they have a very good layout and distribution in the world. Last but not least, its financial performance, and the PSS revenue is about €450 million. And we think the revenue will grow in the future. In terms of the revenue, the orders will continue by three to five years. So in the next three to five years, the growing momentum will be maintained and it will also be triggered by these new automakers. In addition, they have great momentum in the innovation with their proprietary technologies and those technologies and innovation will boost the profits. So we think PSS has a great potential in the future growth. In the strategic rationale for the application of PSS, PSS is a sizeable and leading white label automotive speaker manufacturer. And this will make a supplement to AAC. They supply directly to global OEMs, and it is also leading supplier to global audio brands. And secondly, they have a strategic diversification. By acquiring a business with existing skill and operation, AAC achieves meaningful strategic diversification through one transaction, certainly vertical integration. With cooperation with PSS, and we can make a breakthrough in the speakers and amplifiers as well as some products in optics to grab additional value share.  Fourthly is the synergistic opportunities. Moreover the transaction enables AAC to leverage its operational expertise in supply chain and the China market to tap the growth of the global automotive acoustics and EV markets. The reasonable transaction structure, the proposed deal structure enables AAC to retain and effectively motivate the existing key management team, a small part retained in the part of the management. And this will become the incentives for the management and to lead the graph of AAC. And last but not least, the risk mitigation, the retention of existing management mitigates significant due diligence risk and boosts confidence in the execution future business plans.  So the six highlights, the six rationales the main considerations for us to acquire PSS.  PSS product portfolio. The main product is speaker, and then it meets full range, mid-range speakers and woofers, et cetera, and tweeters et cetera. And they will also provide the speakers to the consuming customers. They also have other three segments. The first one is related acoustic system. The first one is about the speaker systems and above, the subwoofer and also the door boxes and headrest solutions, 3D solutions. And they can put this speaker in differed sizes. And so it's more compatible in the automotive. And certainly it's about the safety speakers and the systems. So with the EV's growth, it's very important for the AVAS, the Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System. So this is the requirement for installation in the EVs. And after the acquisition, and we can also -- innovation products. And fourthly is the transducer based haptic systems. Many people are talking about the 3D, and 4D and also, for example, more on haptics experience to our customers. And the PSS has achieved a mass production on those regards on the entertainment and infotainment. So this is a perfect combination of acoustics and optics. So those are the four core business parts or segments of PSS. And the PSS global operational footprint. As I mentioned before, its headquarter is in Belgium. It was founded in Belgium, and those are the main factories. And Mexico factory is mainly serving the U.S. market. And they also have factories in Germany and Hungary. And those are serving the European automotive market, and in Dongguan and Penang in Malaysia for the Chinese markets and the Asian and the global customers. The R&D center is in Belgium and Shenzhen. So those are the R&D centers. You can see from this map, PSS has complete global operational footprint, and they have already established industrial supply chain to serve all the automotives worldwide.  So to close this brief introduction of PSS, and we can come to Q&A session. And thank you. \nUnidentified Company Representative : Thank you on this close introduction.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from CICC.\nHu Peng: I have two questions. And the first question is related to the mobile phone. So you can see the pressure or the price pressure of the mobile phone in the first half of the year. So I'm curious about the long-term strategy of the -- or your view on the long-term demand of the mobile phone. And we also see the recovery or the coming back of Shenzhen customer. So whether this will boost any demand? And also what's the price strategy? My second question is about the optimistic -- is about the optics and inventory. What's your outlook on the inventory on optics business? So I have these two questions. \nUnidentified Company Representative : Okay. Regarding the mobile phone market, yes. In the first half of the year, the shipments of volumes, there’s decline compared with the first half of last year. The whole year, we think the 1.2 billion shipment volumes of last year will decrease to 1.1 billion shipment volume this year.  In terms of the supply chain, based on our understanding of our customers for having raised levels are low as far as we know. So the forecast for the second half of the year will be accurate -- will be more accurate, and the volatilities will not be as big as that of the last year. So this is about the shipments volume for this year. And most customers are targeting on high value products. The models below 1000 or 2000 decreased and many users focused on the models above 2000 or even higher. And we also see the new launch of the mobile phone models and the new models will trigger the upgrade of their system and their models. So in the first quarter and the second quarter, our shipments will be at the low level. But in the second half of the year, the shipments volume will be ramped up compared with the first half. And this market will be more stable and they are value oriented.  Acoustics. The ASP will be lower in the first half. But the second half, the ASP will increase from 4.5 to above 5. It's related to the new models and new components upgrades. And from the perspective of shipments volume, the first half is about 40% to 45% of the total year's shipments volume. So the second half, the volume will be about 50% to 55%, 10% to 15% increase compared with the first half. This profitability in the second half will be increased, especially for the Android system.  And also the production capacity and utilization is increasing, as well as the precision mechanics. And metal casing, of course, this kind of growth was triggered by the Shenzhen customer. And we are developing the collaboration with this customer. We also have the promotion on the high end models. For the precision mechanics, we have very positive feedback compared with the first half of the year. We believe the top-line and the revenue will be increased by 10% to 15% in the second half. The production capacity and utilization as well as their capacity will be increased.  So overall, the mobile smartphone market will develop according to this value base. And we'll be benefiting from this development.  In terms of OpEx and Jack will answer your question. \nJack Duan : So your question is in two parts, the first one is about the average rate. So as of the -- as of to-date, our inventory level is about three months and delivery on operational parts are split up. It's about two weeks to three weeks. And for our very cool inventory, we are destocking. Therefore, the inventory level will be maintained at a very front level compared with last year. The completed products inventory is up by 15% and [MPF] is also market height.  Your second question is about the future outlook. In the second half, our company is more focused on the high end lens. In the first half, for example, the 6P shipments volume accounted for 15% of our total shipments volume. And in the second half, this number will increase. It is in line with our high end products strategy. As mentioned by Kelvin, our customers are returned to the high end and to better experience our products. Our GP margin is increasing. The ASP has declined and this kind of decline will be paused, will be stopped. And this is also beneficial to our second half. And in terms of the inventory, we don't have any inventory in modules and the modules production is based on the orders, and we adjusted the inventory and the production according to the production. We will increase the turnover days, and we will also achieve the cash and inflow positive. And this will help us to maintain a strong cash position.  In a nutshell, we will destock our inventory based on the market demand and to achieve a sound financial position and cash inflow. \nOperator: The next question is from CITIC.\nTao Xu: In the first half, the optics was better than acoustics. What's the difference? What's the reason? It is the year-on-year growth is different. So this is the first question.  And the second question is about the folded smartphone. And we also see a lot of mass production. So what's our value chain on this folded smartphone? And apart from the Beijing customers, do you have any potential expansion market? \nKelvin Pan: From this acoustics perspective, you can see there's large decline in the inventory. So in the first half, the shipments of the acoustics and the ASP and this unit price, the unit price declined by 10% to 15%. And we think in the second half as a unit price will recover to that last year or above that. So that's why we can see this pressure of the acoustics in the first half and so production utilization is not to reach 100%. So we have reduced it to 390 million products, and our target is 800 million, and the unit price will be increased by 20%. So you can see in the second half of the year, this will be boosted and according to the shipments of these two months. And we think these shipments in the second half of the year can reach 450,000 and ASP can reach 5. So this will help us return acoustics to a sound development. That's also the reason why you see the optics performance is better than acoustics in the first half.  And second question is the folded smartphone. Indeed, we have reached with some mass production and the delivery on the -- on our products from Huawei. I think the potential is great and high end smartphone's price is about 10,000 and the smaller phone -- smartphone is about 7,000. And for these high-end products -- and product -- for this turning axis, the price is about 500. We think this year we can produce 300,000 to 500,000. So it's also based on the customers' demand and we think this kind of development is promising, and we are developing the market with more customers. When we have further information, we'll disclose those to all the investors. And we can also see there's a greater potential in this turning axis products. And we see these attitudes -- these very good attitudes toward those high-end.\nTao Xu: Thank you. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, management. \nOperator: And next question is about -- Alex from BOCI. \nAlex Lin: Thank you, management. I have two questions. The first question is about the next three to five year strategy on mobile phone and non-mobile phone. And second question is the automotive acoustics. You are planning to acquire PSS. I want to know the timeline -- specific timeline? In the future, do you have any guidelines for the revenue of acquired PSS and what kind of potential it'll bring about to AAC in the automotive market? Certainly PSS has collaboration with the biggest clients, T clients. But after the acquisition, in terms of an optics motor investor company, have more a potential in their global customer base. So my question is about the overall company's strategy. \nKelvin Pan: I think in terms of the size of the mobile phone -- and this will be slowed down, but the value, for example, the high value products, high-end products with rich functions and experience will be further developed. And therefore ACC, we need to catch this opportunity to cover all of our business, including these models in optics and acoustics, and then we can provide the higher end products to our customers and proceed this upgrading opportunity to increase our revenue and the profits. So this is about the smartphone area.  In terms of the automotive, many people curious about the development of acoustics in AAC. On the PSS, the revenue in 2022 is about €450 million to €500 million. And this will be in our consolidated balance sheet. So in the automotive, the revenue is of equivalent scale of our electronic acoustics. So apart from the acoustics, we can also develop our other business, for example, the non-optics as well as MEMS microphone and automotive motor. And we can make breakthroughs on this regard.  On the -- on this acoustics, automotive acoustic size, we want to reach the target of the same scale in the consumer electronics. PSS has a lot of customers in the U.S. Apart from the U.S., the traditional automakers, as well as the big clients, T clients, they are long-term customers. And this good relation, customer relation are very helpful to AAC, amplifier and the speakers and the other components. And AAC can leverage the PSS and to expand the market. So those are the strategic value of the PSS.\nOperator: Thank you, Alex, for question. Next question is from Wil Zou from First Shanghai. \nWilson Zou: Thank you. My first question is about the ASP of the optic lens in the Q2. So, what's the structural optimization? In the future, the GP margin of optics will become positive. When does it happen?\nUnidentified Company Representative: And the lens restructuring started last year, and this was triggered by the customers' demand in the 5P and 6P and there's kind of verification need in the time. So after verification, high-end product started a mass production and ramped up its production. And this volume has increased by over 10%. In the second half of the year, we will continue to optimize this structure and more 6P products will enter the market. Sorry, I forgot your second question.\nWilson Zou: My second question is about the processing lens, net processing, and also the margin profit, and it's about 15% to 16%, the processing ratio is 15% to 16%.\nUnidentified Company Representative: And the GP margin includes two parts, and the first is about lens, and the margin of lens is negative 10%. We think this growth will turn positive in the second half. And with our deployment on the high-end product, as well as the smart introduction of actions within the company and the technology upgrades, we then estimate in Q4 the optical lens business will gain positive profits.  In terms of the module, this is the second part, the second half, the competition in the second half will become mild. So we think the module GP margin will also turn positive in the second half.\nWilson Zou: My second part, and it's about the Toyo Precision and what's the production capacity?\nUnidentified Company Representative: And after the acquisition of Toyo, the Yangzhou factory, and this year starts its mass production, and the first product will be delivered in Q3 and Q4 and the total production capacity of the factory is estimated of 100,000 to 150,000 pieces. And in Q3, this capacity can reach 15% because we have one project running on it, and there will be more projects onwards. And in the second half, the Yangzhou factory will make some contributions. But it depends on the market demand because the laptop demand is declining this year. So we have to make adjustments on the production according to the customer demand. And the first product has already reached mass production and deliveries. And after the acquisition of Toyo, this benefited to the Group. And after the first product -- in the future, after the first product, the future projects will be ramped up. \nWilson Zou : And for a single slice what unit price? \nUnidentified Company Representative : The single slice for total is 100 to 120. And the Yangzhou factory is about 300 because, it's the precision -- precise process and not a stamping product. \nOperator: And the next question is from [indiscernible]. \nUnidentified Analyst: The question is about the market share of PSS and the book cash, and the revenue of PSS as well and then the market share of PSS? \nUnidentified Company Representative : It's about 15% to 25%. In the high-end speakers, this market share will become larger, higher. So, in the total, speakers, its market share is about 15% to 20%.  In terms of financial, I invite Ms. Dan Guo to answer. \nDan Guo: Okay. I'll answer all the questions on the chat box. The top line is about 450 million to 500 million annually, and it will grow annually. The growth is about -- growth is stable and the GP margin is 20%, and profit margin is 5% to 8%. In the future as we mentioned before and the synergies will come from the cross-selling of the products into the whole supply chain, including the overall production line and operational efficiency. So we think there are still potentials in the future growth. And in terms of the book cash, the net cash is about €10 million to €15 million. And debt, the operating debt is shorter, it's about €50 million to €60 million.\nOperator: Next question is from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: I have two questions. The first two questions is about our big customers in Shenzhen and in Q3 they will launch new models. So I'd like to know more about the preparation on the ASP and the market share. And the second question is about the U.S. big client. Do you have any upgrade on this?\nUnidentified Company Representative: In terms of the big client in Shenzhen, they cast their products focused on the high-end, and we have close collaboration with them and we will elaborate their market development. So the ASP is -- the metal casing as well as the acoustics and the motors, they have higher margins. Their requirements on the ASP, as well as the requirements are higher because their requirement is higher. So the ASP is a 20% to 30% higher than the market price, because it's more customized. And apart from this year's demand, the customers -- future demand is also huge. Therefore, we will forge our collaboration with customer to help them to upgrade the immersive experience. The specific figures depend on the market situation.  In terms of the U.S. customer, in the first half, there are some voices in the market that the company will cancel the motor function. But we think there are still opportunities, but this will be delayed. And the function will be promoted in the future and then maybe post this year or delayed this year, but it will be promoted in the future. And we are paying a close attention to their investment and we can continue to support its R&D and the development on this function.\nOperator: The next question is from [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst: The question is about CapEx and the guidance in the second half of this year and the next year. CapEx of this year is in line with CapEx disclosed before. Before is about 1.85 billion, and the CapEx will reduce by 15%. So CapEx this year is about 1.5 billion. Of course, it depends on our overseas markets plan, other strategies. Or add some information here?\nUnidentified Company Representative : And for our traditional and owned products, the cost is more optimized. So there will not to be any capacity expansion on the traditional products. For our investment, for example, there small functions upgrade via smartphones, for example, the hinge, the new x-axis haptics motor and upgrade. The high value-added components will be the investing areas. But for the owned and traditional mass producing parts, the investment will not be increased. In addition, we also see the separation or the fragmented supply chain of our customers. And we can support these customers and from our overseas factories, and it'll help our customers to mitigate the tax or risks. And thirdly, the CapEx will be on the strategic development, for example, the acquisition of PSS. And in the automotives we will continue our investments. For example, the innovative and automotive speakers or/and the amplifiers and microphones, as well as the automotive optic lens.  So apart from PSS acquisition, AAC will make continuous CapEx in the own automotives business. So the CapEx target this year has already covered all this development. And in the future, we will continue to optimize our cash flow in the mobile phone production line and to achieve a stable business development. And we will efficiently control on our CapEx, but we maintain our investments in innovation. \nOperator: Our time is constrained. And this will be the last question. And the last question is from [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst : Thank you management for this opportunity. I have two questions. The first question is about the precision mechanics. We see 40% increase in the laptops and et cetera. And with the return of the Shenzhen customer, the precision mechanics will become better. On acoustics and the motor and other business segments, do you have any revenue targets? My second question is, how do you see the recovery of the Android market and any upgrade potential in the second half of the year?\nUnidentified Company Representative: And the precision mechanics is very good. And this is related to the Shenzhen customer's cooperation. And what we also see is on high-end model's development. And even these middle end products, we will introduce metal casing and this will become the industrial trend and the overall industry are developing into the mid and high end performance and products. And also the holding and haptics experience is very important. And therefore I think the metal casing will be promoted.  And for the first half of the year, the production capacity, for example, has reached it full capacity. We even need find the third-party partner to expand our capacity. This is good news. And next year in this kind of momentum will be maintained, I believe. The metal casing next year has another increasing point, which is hinge. In Q2 and Q3, we will have our first mass production. And in the second half and the next year, there will be more products. And Android market will use the hinge products as the edge for the -- starting point for the new market. So with the launch of the new hinge smartphones -- and you can see this shipment volumes has created lot, for example, the Shenzhen big clients and the other clients.  So hinge, as its market and its high price -- high unit price, it's a very pivotal structural support. And this will increase the performance of the smartphones and also reduce its weight. And certainly it's about the projects in Yangzhou after the M&A of Toyo and the metal casing for laptops are the focus of Yangzhou factory. Then we think next year and the year after next year, there will be more projects into the mass production in precision mechanics. Profitability and revenue will increase significantly very clear in the precision mechanics segment. So what's your second part of your question? \nUnidentified Analyst : My second question is about the revenue guidance or any upgrade potential in Android market? \nUnidentified Company Representative : Acoustics, motor and the precision mechanics will keep the high-end momentum and their products will be optimized in accordance with this high-end momentum. So we think motor can maintain 20% to 30% unit growth. The mobile phone has steady demand and haptic demand has haptics requirement. And this -- our new motors showed the better performance. And this is also price -- high price to performance ratio, a choice to our customer. And the customer will have a very immediate experience upgrade, for example, SLS and these big acoustics volume products will help meet in high-end customers to upgrade. And we'll increase the quality of sounds as well as the volume.  In the metal casing, as I mentioned before, this middle end mobile phone will use more metal casing as well as the folded mobile phone. And they will help us to increase our top line and the bottom line with the stable production utilization and stable market and all the production line will return to sound level.\nUnidentified Company Representative : Due to the constrained time, this is the end of the 2023 interim results. And our materials has already been uploaded to the official website. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact IR team. Thank you.",

Q1 2025 was highlighted by approximately 16% increase in net revenue and gross profit, respectively, driven by increased contribution from portfolio training and research-based learning service. Portfolio training program credit hours delivery to ACG students increased by 5.8% during the first quarter of 2025. Higher net revenues and slightly reduced operating expenses contributed to improved bottom-line results during the quarter as compared to Q1 2024. Moving on to first quarter operational highlights. Portfolio training services continued to account for the majority of our revenue for the quarter. Total credit hours delivered increased by 5.8% with project-based programs contributing about 74% of total credit hours delivered, translating into a 11.5% growth in revenue from the portfolio training programs. Combined revenues from the research-based learning overseas study counselling and other educational services also increased by more than 28% and it becomes increased revenue contributions responsible for nearly 30% of total net revenues. During the first quarter 2025, we brought a variety of in-person and online research-based learning projects to ACG students. In-person projects included a themed camp to Hainan Province, an AI training camp at Alibaba, tours to The United States and Japan, Milan Fashion Week project in Italy engaging a total of more than 100 students. Apart from delivering our usual level of Master Class projects to students in an online group class format. We also hosted a creative art therapy training program taught by University of London lecturers, which accommodated around eight students in total. We continue to receive a positive feedback from our students about the full 2025 admission results. During first quarter 2025, ACG students received numerous admission from prestigious overseas institutions, including major Ivy League schools, other top schools admissions to name a few came from Cambridge University, Hong Kong University, Nanyang Technological University and so on. Also, our students have received offers from top art schools, some of which are the most popular matched with extremely high application requirements and overall low acceptance rate, including the MFA in Film & Television Production at the University of South California, Arts & Cultural at UC Berkeley and Engineering Design Innovation at Northwestern University. We remain excited about the upcoming admission results for the remainder of the full 2025 application series. We are proud to announce that on March 29th, ACG was awarded the 2025 Forbes China Studying Abroad leading brand along with the new Oriental Education and the new channel International Education on the 2025 International Education Leaders Annual Conference and the Forbes China Studying Abroad Industrial Selection Service Award Ceremony. We are pleased that the campaign is recognized not only by students, but also by industry experts as a leading brand in generating positive outcomes for students who want to study arts abroad. In March, ACG toured five key cities in China as a part of our Spring Art Education Exhibition including Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chengdu and Chongqing. Similar to the October Autumn Art Education Exhibition, we hosted seminars to discuss the [indiscernible] art design topics and observation of overseas study application changes and the mission trends giving participating students and parents a face-to-face opportunity to communicate with the professors from prestigious overseas arts institutions. With that, I will hand over the call to Sima for first quarter 2025.\nRuobai Sima: Thank you, Kevin, and I will start with first quarter 2025 key financial metrics. Total net revenues for first quarter 2025 were RMB55.8 million, an increase of 15.9% from RMB48.1 million in first quarter 2024, which was primarily due to increased revenue contributions from portfolio training programs and research-based learning services as we deliver more services and hosted an increase number of research-based learning experience. Gross profit for first quarter 2025 was RMB25.4 million, an increase of 15.9% from RMB21.9 million in first quarter 2024 primarily due to higher net revenues. Gross margin was 45.5% during first quarter 2025 unchanged as compared to 45.5% in the prior year period. Total operating expenses were RMB42.2 million in first quarter 2025, slightly decreasing from RMB43.6 million in first quarter 2024, while as a percentage of net revenue, total operating expenses decreased to 75.6% during first quarter 2025 compared to 90.6% in the prior year period. The slight decrease in operating expenses was due to RMB1.3 million decrease in selling expenses and RMB0.3 million decrease in research and development expenses as ACG system development was completed in Q2 2024 and the collection of previously impaired loans and other receivables, offset by increased general and administrative expenses mainly related to the professional fees and the development of new projects. As a result of higher net revenues and slightly lower operating expenses, loss from operations in first quarter 2025 was RMB16.8 million compared to RMB21.7 million in the first quarter 2024. Net loss attributable to ACG during first quarter 2025 was RMB13.3 million compared to RMB17.9 million in the prior year period. Moving to the balance sheet highlights. At March 31, 2025, we have RMB39.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. Total assets of RMB457.3 million, total liabilities of RMB390.9 million and total shareholders' equity of RMB66.4 million. Moving to year-to-date enrollment trends. Starting with student enrollment. For first quarter 2025, total student enrollment was 1,104, representing a decrease of 19.4% from the prior year period. The decrease in student enrollment was a result of normalized demand in our service in 2025 versus same period in 2024 and 2023. As we discussed in the fiscal year 2025 outlook last quarter. Portfolio training student enrollment for first quarter 2025 was 626 and student enrollment for all other programs for first quarter 2025 was 478. Moving on to credit hours delivery. For first quarter 2025, credit hours delivery slightly increased by 5.8% driven by a 15.5% increase in project-based programs, which in recent years have accounted for a continuously increasing percentage of total credit hours. And it was partly offset by decreased time-based programs credit hours. With that, let's move to our expectations for the full year 2025. We're expected to report total net revenues of between approximately RMB276 million to RMB281 million for the year ended December 31, 2025, which represents a year-over-year increase of around 3% to 5% for full year of 2024. We anticipate the growth to be primarily driven by our portfolio training services and supported by all other lines of business. We remain prudently optimistic in our fiscal year 2025 guidance range and these assumptions are based on the company's existing business initiatives underway for the year ending December 31, 2025 and the current and preliminary view of existing domestic and international market conditions, which are subject to change. I'd now like to turn it over to Jun who will expand upon our long-term growth strategy. Jun, please go ahead.\nJun Zhang: [Foreign Language] Thank you, Sima. I will now discuss more recent execution highlights of our long-term growth initiatives. Our focus in 2025 remains to be driving organic expansion, controlling expenses and improving overall operational efficiency. As part of the ongoing efforts to increase classroom utilization and provide higher-value programs, we have started to strategically allocate marketing resources to higher-performing campus locations, driving local sales where our teaching team can efficiently satisfy the growing demand of new students. For years, student interest in our services and the trust they have demonstrated during the time they work with us have encouraged us to work towards becoming a leading provider of creative arts education service. We're proud to be able to continue to make quality offerings accessible to a growing student population and remain enthusiastic about the creative arts education market in China. We expect our organic growth among all four growth pillars to lead ACG's long-term growth momentum. Our services and products continue to be highly valued by ACG students. We continue to encourage students to opt for the more flexible and personalized project-based track of our portfolio training programs. While helping students complete their portfolio creation projects more efficiently through mindful planning and intensified coaching. The variety of new project-based programs we are offering are gaining traction as we are fostering creative thinking via an interactive learning environment, but also due to flexibility as many of these programs are completed in-person and/or online. Students enrolled in portfolio training services have taken on a growing interest in our research base and overseas study counselling programs, contributing to a more substantial part of our revenue growth. On top of that, we're actively leveraging our teaching resources and our current portfolio of services to address our expanded student base, serving older adults and younger generation who are looking for experiential learning opportunities in art studies, workshops and themed travels. For second quarter 2025, we have a strong pipeline of new research-based learning projects lined up for ACG students. These include the Cannes Film Festival Tour and multiple online Master Class offerings, covering stage design, digital media visual communication, jewelry design and interactive sensation. We expect to launch more research-based learning experiences in the third quarter during the summer vacation, contributing to the continuous growth of ACG's business. Furthermore, in 2025, we'll continue to strengthen and expand our geographic footprint. For one, broadening our international partnership network outside of the UK and the US. This has helped expand our assets to global resources and assist an increased number of students who are now exploring study abroad options in more destinations, including Europe, Japan and Southeast Asia such as Singapore. We believe our competitive advantages are built on a long-term domestic and international partnerships base. Our highly developed teaching team, which consists of experience in class teaching staff and lectures from esteemed schools globally and a continuous investment in introducing new offerings. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.

As Alice mentioned, please refer to our earnings stake available on the IR site of our website. As we go through our prepared remarks, during 2024, with the mission of driving positive student outcomes in mind, ATA Creativity Global continued to concentrate on making college educational service available to our students. Our investment in the teaching team allowed us to introduce really good and customized offerings. And our efforts to expand and amend institutional partnerships expanded the access to world-class educational resources. We also actively explore new ways to improve overall operation efficiencies, from streaming operations and locating regional resources to initiating the integration of AI technologies into our service, which we believe will continue to drive long-term value to our operations. The fourth quarter of 2024 was highlighted by significant growth in net revenues and the bottom line results. We reported more than a 20% increase in net revenues, driving a similar level of improvement in our gross profit. Portfolio trading programs, credit hours delivered to ATA Creativity Global students increased by over 35% during the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result of increased revenues, net income attributable to ATA Creativity Global grew by 54.9% to RMB13.3 billion. Similarly, for the full year 2024, we reported a net revenue growth of since year one, Fintech, exceeding the high end of our full year guidance, which resulted in a 23.2% increase in gross profit for the year. Overall student enrollment rates continue to grow, and our core business for aerial training facilities recorded a significant decrease in student error rates, as well as a greater number of deliveries. Moving on to fourth quarter operation highlights, Portfolio Credit Service accounted for the majority of our revenues for the quarter, with project-based programs contributing to 66.8% total credit in our delivery. The demand for our portfolio trading service demand is strong, and we were pleased that we have been able to address this demand with the teaching team that students trust. We've organized small group classes, which allows more students to take lessons for popular teachers, has increased credit hours delivery while enhancing teaching efficiencies at the same time. Revenues from Rich Baader's overseas study and other educational services all increased by more than 46%. The cost of the optimization of the United Nations September development of course, our school boot camp, our Shanghai Fashion Week program, and several of Mastercard's covering arts topics like character, animation, visual communication, and interior design. As we turn to the 2025 application season, and many of our students have submitted their application portfolios to overseas schools, we are glad to share that our students have started to receive very well early admission results. So far, our students have received offers and scholarships from schools such as Hong Kong University, Columbia University, Rhode Island School of Design in the United States, and the University of the Arts London, University College London in the UK as well as prestigious art schools in Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia. At the same time, we continue to expand our partnership base, and we began providing educational services to two additional higher education institutions, the Central Academy of Drama and the Nanjing University of Arts. During the quarter, we made the strategic decision to discontinue our junior Arc service aiming to increase the overall efficiency of our operations, which contributed to a lower the G&A expense during the quarter. With that, I will hand over the call to Ruobai Sima for a detailed overview of our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2024, and to provide some guidance for fiscal year 2025.\nRuobai Sima: Thank you, Kevin. And I will start with the fourth quarter and full year financial metrics. Total net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024 was RMB109 million, an increase of 20.7% from RMB83.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from Apollo training programs, research-based learnings, and overseas study company services. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2024 was RMB53.7 million, an increase of 21.6% from RMB52.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher net revenues. Gross margin slightly increased to 63.1% during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 62.6% in the prior year period, mainly as a result of higher net revenues despite an increase in cost associated with more teaching staff hired as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 to accommodate increased numbers of students. Total operating expenses were RMB46.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 8% from RMB43.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an RMB6.8 million increase in sales selling expenses related to an increased number of sales personnel and marketing events in various different channels, which was partially offset by an RMB2.4 million decrease in general and administrative expenses mainly as a result of the disposal of ATA Creativity Global's junior R Services in the fourth quarter of 2024, and an RMB0.9 million decrease in R&D expenses as OTP system development was completed in Q2 2024. Income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2024 was RMB17 million, compared to RMB9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income attributable to ATA Creativity Global during the fourth quarter of 2024 was RMB13.3 million, compared to RMB8.6 million in the prior year period. Turning to full year 2024, total net revenues increased by 21% to RMB268.1 million from RMB221.6 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased contributions from portfolio training, research-based learning, and overseas study consulting services. Gross profit for the full year 2024 was RMB141.3 million, an increase of 23.2% from RMB114.7 million in the full year 2023, as a result of increased revenues during the full year 2024. Gross margin slightly improved to 52.7% from 51.7% in the full year 2023. Total operating expenses were RMB184 million in the full year 2024, an increase of 18.1% from RMB156.2 million in the full year 2023. The increase was primarily due to an RMB21.2 million increase in sales selling expenses as a result of the expansion of our sales team and an increase in marketing events, such as the arts education equation and fusion arts exhibition, as well as an RMB8.1 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to increased professional fees and business expense-related investments, and was slightly offset by lower research and development expenses, which decreased by RMB0.9 million. Income from operations in the full year 2024 was RMB43 million, compared to RMB41.5 million in the full year 2023. Net loss attributable to ATA Creativity Global for the full year 2024 was RMB36.1 million, compared to RMB33.7 million. Moving to the balance sheet highlights, as of December 31, 2024, we had RMB36.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, total assets of RMB456.9 million, total liabilities of RMB377.3 million, and total shareholders' equity of RMB79.6 million. Moving to year-to-date enrollment trends, for the full year 2024, total student enrollment increased by 15.8% as compared to the full year 2023, supported by strong student interest growth in both ATA Creativity Global's portfolio training and other programs. Portfolio training student enrollment for the full year 2024 increased by 12.9% to 2,807, and all other program student enrollment for the full year 2024 increased by 20.2% to 1,974. For the full year 2024, we continued to record higher credit hours delivered from the second half of the year, similar to prior year results, as our students started to prepare for portfolio work. For the full year 2024, credit hours delivered significantly increased by 30.8%, whereby time-based program credit hours increased by 32% and project-based program credit hours increased by 30.2%. With that, let's move to guidance for the full year 2025. ATA Creativity Global is proud to achieve total net revenues of between approximately RMB276 million to RMB281 million for the year ending December 31, 2025, which represents a year-over-year increase of around 3% to 5% from the full year 2024. We anticipate that the growth will be primarily driven by our portfolio training services, which is also a significant student acquisition channel for all of our other business. As more students sign up for our courses, we will end the full year 2024 with double-digit revenue growth and overall increased demand across our business lines following the COVID-19 international travel recovery. We expect full year 2025 growth to return to normalized levels, and we expect our business to record continuous growth and just believe that strategic initiatives that we are implementing extremely well depend on Yabit. Will drive our long-term growth in NPS 2025. I'd like to turn it to Jun Zhang, who will expand upon our long-term growth strategy. Jun Zhang, please go ahead.\nJun Zhang: Thank you so much. For 2025 and beyond, our goal remains to be a leading provider of creative arts education services and products in China to students interested in a creative arts education and career. We believe our long-term growth is fueled by organic growth, strengthening and expanding geographic footprint, launch of new services, and potential M&A opportunities. The strong growth trend we observed in student enrollment and services delivered, as well as in our internal sales records, have reinforced our confidence in ATA Creativity Global's business and the market potential of creative arts education in China. We expect our organic growth to be supported by higher fee and higher margin services. For one, encouraging students interested in our portfolio training services to enroll in a project-based track, which offers higher value services compared to time-based programs due to its flexibility and customizability. Furthermore, we expect positive student feedback on our core portfolio training services to drive increased interest in our other services, such as research-based learning and overseas study counseling services. With our frontline teachers and sales team's input into designing our course offerings, we released our capabilities to introduce new and unique research-based learning experiences, and a growing student interest in our overseas study counseling services will continue to fuel revenue growth and gross margin improvement. For 2025, to strengthen and expand our geographic footprint, ATA Creativity Global will continue to expand coverage in existing cities and strategically locate our regional resources to maximize operations at larger centers. In January 2025, ATA Creativity Global announced the grand opening of our ACG Japan Center, which focuses on Japanese language training and arts education. At the ACG Japan Center, we provide both online and in-person language training services and help students settle down after they arrive for their future study, as well as tutoring students on their application portfolios and hosting various arts events. The opening of the ACG Japan Center follows the opening of our London Center in September 2024, which has since been actively serving students in London and surrounding areas. We are committed to helping students achieve their goals as a trusted partner throughout their journey with ATA Creativity Global. We have invested in the innovation and introduction of new research-based learning projects, which have become an increasingly substantial part of our revenue source. Since the beginning of 2025, we have introduced various experiences in both in-person and online formats, serving students of different age groups and with various arts backgrounds and majors. These programs included creative arts healing training program, led by University of London lecturers, Japanese classic animation study tour in Tokyo, Sea Island environmental protection creative art camp in Sanya, Hainan province, Safari Photography Creation Camp in East Africa, Milan Fashion Week internship program, IB Leak Art Campus Tour on the East Coast of the US, and Alibaba artificial intelligence training camp. Last but not least, ATA Creativity Global remains diligent in actively exploring potential M&A opportunities in 2025 to supplement our service portfolio of high-quality creative arts education products to our students. Serving our students with the best offerings is at the core of our business, especially as we continue to expand our student population and address the evolving needs of our students. We are excited about our growth in 2025 and believe our investment in our teaching team and the strategic initiatives we take to improve our operating efficiency will continue to drive results for ATA Creativity Global and our shareholders.

As we go through our prepared remarks, during 2024, with the mission of driving positive student outcomes in mind, ATA Creativity Global continued to concentrate on making college educational service available to our students. Our investment in the teaching team allowed us to introduce really good and customized offerings. And our efforts to expand and amend institutional partnerships expanded the access to world-class educational resources. We also actively explore new ways to improve overall operation efficiencies, from streaming operations and locating regional resources to initiating the integration of AI technologies into our service, which we believe will continue to drive long-term value to our operations. The fourth quarter of 2024 was highlighted by significant growth in net revenues and the bottom line results. We reported more than a 20% increase in net revenues, driving a similar level of improvement in our gross profit. Portfolio trading programs, credit hours delivered to ATA Creativity Global students increased by over 35% during the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result of increased revenues, net income attributable to ATA Creativity Global grew by 54.9% to RMB13.3 billion. Similarly, for the full year 2024, we reported a net revenue growth of since year one, Fintech, exceeding the high end of our full year guidance, which resulted in a 23.2% increase in gross profit for the year. Overall student enrollment rates continue to grow, and our core business for aerial training facilities recorded a significant decrease in student error rates, as well as a greater number of deliveries. Moving on to fourth quarter operation highlights, Portfolio Credit Service accounted for the majority of our revenues for the quarter, with project-based programs contributing to 66.8% total credit in our delivery. The demand for our portfolio trading service demand is strong, and we were pleased that we have been able to address this demand with the teaching team that students trust. We've organized small group classes, which allows more students to take lessons for popular teachers, has increased credit hours delivery while enhancing teaching efficiencies at the same time. Revenues from Rich Baader's overseas study and other educational services all increased by more than 46%. The cost of the optimization of the United Nations September development of course, our school boot camp, our Shanghai Fashion Week program, and several of Mastercard's covering arts topics like character, animation, visual communication, and interior design. As we turn to the 2025 application season, and many of our students have submitted their application portfolios to overseas schools, we are glad to share that our students have started to receive very well early admission results. So far, our students have received offers and scholarships from schools such as Hong Kong University, Columbia University, Rhode Island School of Design in the United States, and the University of the Arts London, University College London in the UK as well as prestigious art schools in Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia. At the same time, we continue to expand our partnership base, and we began providing educational services to two additional higher education institutions, the Central Academy of Drama and the Nanjing University of Arts. During the quarter, we made the strategic decision to discontinue our junior Arc service aiming to increase the overall efficiency of our operations, which contributed to a lower the G&A expense during the quarter.

Please go ahead Mr. Ma.\nKevin Ma: Thank you, Alice. Welcome everyone. Good evening to those in America. I appreciate everyone's time. As Alice mentioned, please refer to our earnings deck available on the IR site of our website as we go through our prepared remarks. During the third quarter of 2024, ACG continued to focus on providing quality service to our valued students and parents developing product and service offering tailored to our students growing and evolving needs, exploring new partnership with institutions within the art industry as well as seeking collaboration opportunities through different industries. As our last third quarter of 2024 was a strong quarter for ACG in terms of net revenues and student enrollment. We reported double-digit growth in net revenues and overall student enrollment rates. This is highlighted by strong student enrollment for our portfolio training programs as well as increased credited training [ph] hour deliveries during the period. For nine months 2024, we saw equal strong year-over-year improvement on net revenues overall enrollment rate and credit hour deliveries all increased by more than 20% compared to nine months 2023. Portfolio training service remains our main source of revenues contributing more than 70% of our total revenues for both third quarter 2024 and the nine months 2024. Within this part of the service, we continue to encourage students to sign up for project-based programs. As a result, this segment continues to account for the majority of our portfolio training services responsible for 70% of total credit hours delivered during the third quarter. Thanks to our continuous effort in developing various programs and offerings we are also seeing a growing interest in other parts of our service. Student enrollments for research-based learning and overseas study, counseling, increased by more than 20% compared to the third quarter 2023. For this summer our five projects included the second session of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Arts Boot Camp; two, intangible cultural heritage camps in China; one US campus tour; and two summer camps in London and Tokyo. In addition, for the first time since the pandemic apart from our usually online classes we also hosted the ACG Summer Lab, providing students with the opportunity to study in person with lecturers joining us from art institutions and the art field in general. We believe the capability to provide us with various experience is one of ACG's core competencies in the rich part [ph], which is built upon our continuous investments and close mentoring of the art change in academia and the industry, as well as a strong global financial network that allow us to be world-class resources. During third quarter 2024, we continued to expand our partnership network by establishing [ph] new strategic partnership with Leeds Conservatoire in the UK and also the [indiscernible] technology, which Jun will expand on later. With that, I will hand over the call to Sima for a detailed overview of our financial and operating results for the third quarter and nine months 2024 and our guidance for fiscal year 2024.\nRuobai Sima: Thank you, Kevin, and I will start with third quarter and nine months key financial metrics. Total net revenue for third quarter 2024 were RMB67.3 million, an increase of 13.1% from RMB59.5 million in third quarter 2023, which was primarily due to increased revenue contributions from research-based learnings and portfolio training services. Gross profit from third quarter 2024 was RMB30 million, an increase of 2.6% from RMB29.2 million in the third quarter 2023. Gross margin was 44.6% during third quarter 2024, compared to 49.2% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was mainly a result of higher costs related to more teaching staff hired as compared to third quarter 2023 to accommodate increased numbers of students and the larger outsourcing costs related to research-based learning services. Total operating expenses was RMB47.7 million in third quarter of 2024, an increase of 28.4% from RMB37.1 million in the third quarter 2023. The increase was primarily due to an RMB5.4 million increase in sales expenses related to increased number of sales personnel and marketing events, as well as RMB5.6 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to increased professional fees and business expansion related investments. As a result, loss from operations in the third quarter 2024 was RMB17.6 million, compared to RMB7.9 million in the third quarter 2023. Net loss attributable to ACG during third quarter 2024 was RMB14.7 million, compared to RMB7.3 million in the prior year period. Turning to nine months 2024. Total net revenues increased 21.1% to RMB167.1 million from RMB138 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to increased contribution from portfolio training, research based learning and overseas study counseling services. Gross profit for nine months 2024 was RMB77.6 million, an increase of 24.6% from RMB52.3 million in nine months in 2023. As a result of increased revenues during nine months 2024, gross margin slightly improved to 46.4% from 45.1% in nine months 2023. Total operating expense was RMB137.7 million in nine months 2024, an increase of 22% from RMB112.9 million in nine months 2023. The increase was primarily due to RMB14.4 million increase in sales expenses related to increased number of sales personnel to drive sales growth, as well as RMB10.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to increased professional fees and business expansion related investments. As a result, loss from operations in nine months 2024 was RMB60 million, compared to RMB50.6 million in nine months 2023. Net loss attributable to ACG in nine months 2024 was RMB49.4 million, compared to RMB42.2 million. Moving to the balance sheet highlights.

Moving on to year-to-date enrollment trends. For nine months 2024, total student enrollment increased by 20% as compared to nine months 2023, supported by strong student interest growth in both ACG portfolio training and all other programs. Portfolio training student enrollment for nine months 2024 increased by 20.7% to 2,220 and all other program student enrollment for nine months 2024 increased by 19.1% to 1,523. Credit hours delivered for portfolio training services is historically higher due to seasonal reasons and students early start their portfolio creation work, in the second half of the year for enrollment in the following fall semester. For nine months 2024, credit hours delivered significantly increased by 28.5%, whereby time-based programs credit hour increased by 29% and progress-based programs credit hour increased by 28.3%. We remain committed to offering high-quality services across our business line and to students who seek guidance and support in their pursuit of study and career era. With that, let's move into guidance to full year 2024. We believe we are on track to achieve our full year 2024 revenue guidance for RMB233 million to RMB255 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 5% to 15% for full year 2023. Our belief is based on the strong enrollment trend, we are seeing and our ability to expand current services and offering. For the remainder of 2024, portfolio training services will continue to serve as the primary growth driver for our business as well as important student acquisition channel for our other business. I'd like to turn it over to Jun, who will expand upon our long-term growth strategy. Jun, please go ahead.\nJun Zhang: [Foreign Language] Thank you, Sima. Our growth strategy surrounds four main pillars: Organic growth; strengthening and expanding geographic footprint; launch of new services; and potential M&A opportunities. Starting with organic growth. As Sima mentioned, we have been encouraging students to enroll in our portfolio training services to join the project-based track, which offers more flexible and customizable programs based on student needs. The overall strong enrollment trend that we're seeing in today's market is also exciting. We see more students from portfolio training services showing interest in our value-added offerings, such as research-based learning and overseas study counseling services, resulting in increased student enrollments and hence, increased revenue contribution. The engagement of our teaching staff in sales and product design process has also helped us improve program quality and boost sales. We have expanded training center coverage in existing cities and concentrated regional resources on larger centers. For example, we expanded our Shanghai and Beijing centers to serve more students during 2024. We recently opened the ACG London Center, extending ACG services to our students who have been admitted to UK colleges and are just embarking on their overseas life. At the London Center, we provide academic assistance, student and an online networking events as well as to create support in addition to helping students settle down on their first few months of studying abroad. Innovation and introduction of new research-based learning programs have been crucial to growing that line of business. To that end, we actively invest and explore new trends in art from computer-based arts majors such as visual art, user interaction, gaming design and AI-generated content to new art themes and career options such as art therapists, green architecture, urban design and so on. We continue to extend our global reach through growing our domestic and international network of institutional partnership. In third quarter 2024, we signed a new institutional partnership with Leeds Conservatoire, a prestigious music conservatory in the UK, whereby Leeds Conservatoire lecturers will work with ACG in providing application insights and portfolio preparation tips to ACG students. In addition, we also recently initiated a strategic cooperation with Oasis Star Educational Technology to jointly promote the integration of art and artificial intelligence. Utilizing Oasis Star's AI technologies and cloud platform, we expect to introduce AI support in upgrading our existing offerings and service delivery model, fueling our long-term growth via better products and services to our students. This October, we again hosted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Arts Boot Camp, marking the third session of this series since we initially introduced it this May. We also hosted our Shanghai Fashion Week program in October, bringing students to forefront of fashion week for students interested in future study and career in fashion design and brand management. During October, ACG toured 10 cities in China as part of our awesome art education exhibition, inviting professors from institutions such as Rhode Island School of Design to give them speeches and share application tips and ACG alumni to share study experience and career advice. We remain focused on growing our student registration, expanding demographics from students who want to pursue overseas study opportunities to working professionals who look to expand their career opportunities and to the general public who are willing to explore multiple topics of art. ACG's mission remains to act as a trusted partner for our students regardless of where they are in their academic or career path. We're well equipped to do so and we'll continue to invest in our infrastructure and the teaching team to always make high-quality offerings available to our students. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator:\nKevin Ma: ...directly to us or our Investor Relations firm, the Equity Group. We are always available to speak to investors, and I look forward to speaking with you or during our next earnings call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference.

Please go ahead Mr. Ma.\nKevin Ma: Thank you, Alice. Welcome everyone. Good evening to those in America. I appreciate everyone's time. As Alice mentioned, please refer to our earnings deck available on the IR site of our website as we go through our prepared remarks. During the third quarter of 2024, ACG continued to focus on providing quality service to our valued students and parents developing product and service offering tailored to our students growing and evolving needs, exploring new partnership with institutions within the art industry as well as seeking collaboration opportunities through different industries. As our last third quarter of 2024 was a strong quarter for ACG in terms of net revenues and student enrollment. We reported double-digit growth in net revenues and overall student enrollment rates. This is highlighted by strong student enrollment for our portfolio training programs as well as increased credited training [ph] hour deliveries during the period. For nine months 2024, we saw equal strong year-over-year improvement on net revenues overall enrollment rate and credit hour deliveries all increased by more than 20% compared to nine months 2023. Portfolio training service remains our main source of revenues contributing more than 70% of our total revenues for both third quarter 2024 and the nine months 2024. Within this part of the service, we continue to encourage students to sign up for project-based programs. As a result, this segment continues to account for the majority of our portfolio training services responsible for 70% of total credit hours delivered during the third quarter. Thanks to our continuous effort in developing various programs and offerings we are also seeing a growing interest in other parts of our service. Student enrollments for research-based learning and overseas study, counseling, increased by more than 20% compared to the third quarter 2023. For this summer our five projects included the second session of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Arts Boot Camp; two, intangible cultural heritage camps in China; one US campus tour; and two summer camps in London and Tokyo. In addition, for the first time since the pandemic apart from our usually online classes we also hosted the ACG Summer Lab, providing students with the opportunity to study in person with lecturers joining us from art institutions and the art field in general. We believe the capability to provide us with various experience is one of ACG's core competencies in the rich part [ph], which is built upon our continuous investments and close mentoring of the art change in academia and the industry, as well as a strong global financial network that allow us to be world-class resources. During third quarter 2024, we continued to expand our partnership network by establishing [ph] new strategic partnership with Leeds Conservatoire in the UK and also the [indiscernible] technology, which Jun will expand on later. With that, I will hand over the call to Sima for a detailed overview of our financial and operating results for the third quarter and nine months 2024 and our guidance for fiscal year 2024.\nRuobai Sima: Thank you, Kevin, and I will start with third quarter and nine months key financial metrics. Total net revenue for third quarter 2024 were RMB67.3 million, an increase of 13.1% from RMB59.5 million in third quarter 2023, which was primarily due to increased revenue contributions from research-based learnings and portfolio training services. Gross profit from third quarter 2024 was RMB30 million, an increase of 2.6% from RMB29.2 million in the third quarter 2023. Gross margin was 44.6% during third quarter 2024, compared to 49.2% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was mainly a result of higher costs related to more teaching staff hired as compared to third quarter 2023 to accommodate increased numbers of students and the larger outsourcing costs related to research-based learning services. Total operating expenses was RMB47.7 million in third quarter of 2024, an increase of 28.4% from RMB37.1 million in the third quarter 2023. The increase was primarily due to an RMB5.4 million increase in sales expenses related to increased number of sales personnel and marketing events, as well as RMB5.6 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to increased professional fees and business expansion related investments. As a result, loss from operations in the third quarter 2024 was RMB17.6 million, compared to RMB7.9 million in the third quarter 2023. Net loss attributable to ACG during third quarter 2024 was RMB14.7 million, compared to RMB7.3 million in the prior year period. Turning to nine months 2024. Total net revenues increased 21.1% to RMB167.1 million from RMB138 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily attributable to increased contribution from portfolio training, research based learning and overseas study counseling services. Gross profit for nine months 2024 was RMB77.6 million, an increase of 24.6% from RMB52.3 million in nine months in 2023. As a result of increased revenues during nine months 2024, gross margin slightly improved to 46.4% from 45.1% in nine months 2023. Total operating expense was RMB137.7 million in nine months 2024, an increase of 22% from RMB112.9 million in nine months 2023. The increase was primarily due to RMB14.4 million increase in sales expenses related to increased number of sales personnel to drive sales growth, as well as RMB10.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to increased professional fees and business expansion related investments. As a result, loss from operations in nine months 2024 was RMB60 million, compared to RMB50.6 million in nine months 2023. Net loss attributable to ACG in nine months 2024 was RMB49.4 million, compared to RMB42.2 million. Moving to the balance sheet highlights. As of September 30, 2024, we had RMB39.4 million in cash and cash equivalents; total assets of RMB459.4 million, total liabilities of RMB393.2 million; and total shareholders' equity of RMB66.2 million. Moving on to year-to-date enrollment trends. For nine months 2024, total student enrollment increased by 20% as compared to nine months 2023, supported by strong student interest growth in both ACG portfolio training and all other programs.

We appreciate everyone's time. We were pleased to see student demand for portfolio training services continue to depend in second quarter 2024. This is our core business and primary driver of growth contributing RMB40.2 million in revenue during the period, 41.9% year-over-year. As a result, we achieved significant top line growth, a 42.8% increase in total net revenue to RMB41.8 million. During second quarter 2024, building the enrollment was 5,084, an increase of 15.8% from the prior year period. Of those students, 612 were enrolled in ACG portfolio training programs compared to 540 in the second quarter of last year. 42,841 portfolio training credit hours were delivered during the period, up 49.3% year-over-year. We are excited to see continued expansion across all of our business including research-based learning and overseas study counseling services. We strongly believe in the value our comprehensive offerings provide to students and impact that. The enrollment growth we have seen thus far in the year, we also saw strong performance in the second half of 2024. Our investment is in expanding the teaching and sales staff have contributed to those results and reserve as a foundation for full term growth. With that, let's move to financials for second quarter 2024. Total net revenues for second quarter 2024 was RMB41.8 million, an increase of 42.8% from RMB36.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. Gross margin improved to 49.6% during the second quarter 2024 from 39.5% in the prior year period, primarily as a result of significantly increased revenue. Net loss attributable to ACG was RMB15.8 million during the second quarter 2024 compared to RMB17.2 million in the prior year period. Bottom line results were impacted by a 30.2% increase in operating expenses related to increased G&A expenses for higher professional fees and exposed for business retention and increased sales expense due to the performance bonus in line with increased sales and the area of additional sales personnel. During the first half of 2024, total net revenues increased 27.2% to RMB99.9 million compared to RMB78.6 million in the prior year period. Gross margin improved to 47.7% from 42.1% in the prior year period. Net loss attributable to ACG was RMB34.7 million compared to RMB35 million. Moving to the balance sheet.

Working capital deficit was $40.7 million and total shareholders active was $11 million at June 30, 2024, compared to working capital deficit of $34.4 million and shareholders' equity of $15.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Kevin, who will expand upon our outlook and growth strategy. Kevin?\nKevin Ma : Thank you, Sima. We are pleased to see ACG's portfolio of offerings continued to resonate with students translating into meaningful financial results. As our portfolio training service is grows, we believe the demand for overseas study counseling and research-based learning service will also expand. During the first half of 2024, we made a mindful investments to add resources to help drive student enrollment and support the growing students' population, which is imperative to enable positive student outcomes and our ability to achieve long-term success. We reported RMB99.9 million in net revenues in the first half 2024. As the second half of the year has historically been stronger than they are than the first, attributing we anticipate will continue in 2024. We are reiterating our revenue expectations for the year ending -- I'm sorry. We are reiterating our revenue expectations from the year ending December 31, 2024. We expect the total revenue will be in the range of RMB230 million to RMB235 million, which is at 5% to 50% increase for the fiscal year 2023. ACG demands focus on growing our student base and expanding our current business while exploring potential acquisition opportunities. And as any material development arise, we'll be sure to update the market and the average guidance as appreciate. ACG is a product of its ability to identify and fulfill students' needs in having social and creative environment. This is the cornerstone of our product design and execution, especially as our students have increasing time from devices, academic and creative background. To that end, we have not only continued to engage teaching staff in the sales and the cost design process, but we also hosted the ACG Arts Education Exhibition in April across five major cities in China including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen. As extension, we invite the former and current advising committee office from prestigious overseas universities such as MIT and Stanford University to join us in sharing their insights on overseas studies applications and the career planning. The exhibition was met with extraordinary interest across all of our service offering. Through a series of marketing efforts, we continue to increase our market exposure and engage with students who are interested in potentially exploring creative arts education in the future. During second quarter 2024, we successfully hosted the second session of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Arts Boot Camp to 70 students. Participating students ranged from high school to college age, and they came together to create a group project on sustainability topics with a variety of application such as climate changes, regenerative energy and environmental protection. Our mascot have also get the small groups of students in their respective areas of interest, allowing them to walk away with individual artworks in visual communication, photographs as well as interior design, and we hope will strengthen their portfolio for all their school applications. We're very excited for many of our graduate ACG students, who will embark on the next set of their creative arts education at overseas institutions this fall. For all 2024, as mentioned, we have seen significant growth in the number of offers received by ACG students. Those of have come from schools all over the world, including topping institutions such as Harvard, Oxford and University of Pennsylvania as well as top arts institutions such as School of Visual Arts, the Pratt Institute and the Parsons School of Design. We believe this positive trend in received offers is a positive indicator of increased student demand for overseas student opportunities, which bodes well for our overseas study counseling service business. We believe those trends will continue into the coming application period. And now to hand the floor over to Jun Zhang, ACG's President, to provide an update on our current growth initiatives. Jun will make his remarks in Mandarin, which will be followed by an English translation. Jun, please go ahead.\nJun Zhang: Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. As we have invested in the expansion of ACG's business, the quality of our products and services have stayed top of line. At the end of the day, our well-rounded offerings and the ability to support students in this journey are what really make all the difference. We have been pleased to host a variety of research-based learning experiences this summer, covering a wide range of our topics and immersive hands-on culture experiences. In July, we hosted a second session of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Arts Boot Camp inspired by the success of our May session, which is more -- which is once again, highly rated by participating students. In addition to online Master Classes taught by prestigious art institution lecturers, we also hosted two intangible cultural heritage-themed camps in Dunhuang, Gansu Province and West Sichuan Province, which are led by instructors from Rhode Island School of Design and Yale University to explore the beauty of China's traditional arts. In Dunhuang, students visited Mogao Caves and Yulin Caves to study Dunhuang-style colored sculpture and mineral camping. In West Sichuan, students were exposed to Asian music and cultural traditions and experienced Tibetan culture. We believe these types of experiences provide students with a unique learning opportunity and perspective, allowing them to go beyond the world they know and are familiar with. The ability to adapt and be open-minded is particularly valuable for those applying to study overseas and must create a solid application portfolio that demonstrates an understanding of and love for art, for different cultures and tradition. We're also bringing students overseas this summer to Japan, the United States and to the United Kingdom through summer schools and campus visits. Understanding that education is the cornerstone of a student's lifetime success both academically and professionally, ACG has prided itself on our ability to establish and maintain highly collaborative relationships with world-renowned institutions. And we look forward to growing our partnership network to assess more world-class educational resources for our students. We expect to enter their overseas study application season soon and are prepared to serve as a trusted guidance supportive to our students during this stressful but exciting times. We remain fully committed to our mission of enabling positive student outcomes and look forward to a busy and productive remainder of the summer as we head into the fall. In the balance of 2024, we're focused on growing our current business, which includes portfolio training services, overseas study counseling and research-based learning services. We remain very confident in ACG's superior competency in the market while continuing to invest in the operational infrastructure to ensure that we're able to provide students with the exceptional education and support system they have come to expect. With that, I'll turn it back over to Kevin.\nKevin Ma: Thanks, Jun. We are pleased our progress in the first half of 2024 and are optimistic that the positive momentum we have experienced thus far will enable us to finish the year on a strong note. As a leading player in China creative art education market, we are proud to see that we have always strived to find the ways to improve our sales and help our students to achieve their full potential. We believe we are on the track to carry out our growth initiatives and drive success for our students and for ACG's shareholders. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no questions at this time. I would like to hand it back over for closing comments. Alice, do you have any closing comments?\n :\n :\nAlice Zhang: Kevin?\nKevin Ma: Thanks again to all of you for joining us.

We appreciate everyone's time. We were pleased to see student demand for portfolio training services continue to depend in second quarter 2024. This is our core business and primary driver of growth contributing RMB40.2 million in revenue during the period, 41.9% year-over-year. As a result, we achieved significant top line growth, a 42.8% increase in total net revenue to RMB41.8 million. During second quarter 2024, building the enrollment was 5,084, an increase of 15.8% from the prior year period. Of those students, 612 were enrolled in ACG portfolio training programs compared to 540 in the second quarter of last year. 42,841 portfolio training credit hours were delivered during the period, up 49.3% year-over-year. We are excited to see continued expansion across all of our business including research-based learning and overseas study counseling services. We strongly believe in the value our comprehensive offerings provide to students and impact that. The enrollment growth we have seen thus far in the year, we also saw strong performance in the second half of 2024. Our investment is in expanding the teaching and sales staff have contributed to those results and reserve as a foundation for full term growth. With that, let's move to financials for second quarter 2024. Total net revenues for second quarter 2024 was RMB41.8 million, an increase of 42.8% from RMB36.2 million in the second quarter of 2023. Gross margin improved to 49.6% during the second quarter 2024 from 39.5% in the prior year period, primarily as a result of significantly increased revenue. Net loss attributable to ACG was RMB15.8 million during the second quarter 2024 compared to RMB17.2 million in the prior year period. Bottom line results were impacted by a 30.2% increase in operating expenses related to increased G&A expenses for higher professional fees and exposed for business retention and increased sales expense due to the performance bonus in line with increased sales and the area of additional sales personnel. During the first half of 2024, total net revenues increased 27.2% to RMB99.9 million compared to RMB78.6 million in the prior year period. Gross margin improved to 47.7% from 42.1% in the prior year period. Net loss attributable to ACG was RMB34.7 million compared to RMB35 million. Moving to the balance sheet. We reported $5.5 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of second quarter 2024. Working capital deficit was $40.7 million and total shareholders active was $11 million at June 30, 2024, compared to working capital deficit of $34.4 million and shareholders' equity of $15.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Kevin, who will expand upon our outlook and growth strategy. Kevin?\nKevin Ma : Thank you, Sima. We are pleased to see ACG's portfolio of offerings continued to resonate with students translating into meaningful financial results. As our portfolio training service is grows, we believe the demand for overseas study counseling and research-based learning service will also expand. During the first half of 2024, we made a mindful investments to add resources to help drive student enrollment and support the growing students' population, which is imperative to enable positive student outcomes and our ability to achieve long-term success. We reported RMB99.9 million in net revenues in the first half 2024. As the second half of the year has historically been stronger than they are than the first, attributing we anticipate will continue in 2024. We are reiterating our revenue expectations for the year ending -- I'm sorry. We are reiterating our revenue expectations from the year ending December 31, 2024. We expect the total revenue will be in the range of RMB230 million to RMB235 million, which is at 5% to 50% increase for the fiscal year 2023. ACG demands focus on growing our student base and expanding our current business while exploring potential acquisition opportunities. And as any material development arise, we'll be sure to update the market and the average guidance as appreciate. ACG is a product of its ability to identify and fulfill students' needs in having social and creative environment. This is the cornerstone of our product design and execution, especially as our students have increasing time from devices, academic and creative background. To that end, we have not only continued to engage teaching staff in the sales and the cost design process, but we also hosted the ACG Arts Education Exhibition in April across five major cities in China including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen. As extension, we invite the former and current advising committee office from prestigious overseas universities such as MIT and Stanford University to join us in sharing their insights on overseas studies applications and the career planning. The exhibition was met with extraordinary interest across all of our service offering. Through a series of marketing efforts, we continue to increase our market exposure and engage with students who are interested in potentially exploring creative arts education in the future. During second quarter 2024, we successfully hosted the second session of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Arts Boot Camp to 70 students. Participating students ranged from high school to college age, and they came together to create a group project on sustainability topics with a variety of application such as climate changes, regenerative energy and environmental protection. Our mascot have also get the small groups of students in their respective areas of interest, allowing them to walk away with individual artworks in visual communication, photographs as well as interior design, and we hope will strengthen their portfolio for all their school applications. We're very excited for many of our graduate ACG students, who will embark on the next set of their creative arts education at overseas institutions this fall. For all 2024, as mentioned, we have seen significant growth in the number of offers received by ACG students. Those of have come from schools all over the world, including topping institutions such as Harvard, Oxford and University of Pennsylvania as well as top arts institutions such as School of Visual Arts, the Pratt Institute and the Parsons School of Design. We believe this positive trend in received offers is a positive indicator of increased student demand for overseas student opportunities, which bodes well for our overseas study counseling service business. We believe those trends will continue into the coming application period. And now to hand the floor over to Jun Zhang, ACG's President, to provide an update on our current growth initiatives. Jun will make his remarks in Mandarin, which will be followed by an English translation. Jun, please go ahead.\nJun Zhang: Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. As we have invested in the expansion of ACG's business, the quality of our products and services have stayed top of line. At the end of the day, our well-rounded offerings and the ability to support students in this journey are what really make all the difference. We have been pleased to host a variety of research-based learning experiences this summer, covering a wide range of our topics and immersive hands-on culture experiences. In July, we hosted a second session of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Arts Boot Camp inspired by the success of our May session, which is more -- which is once again, highly rated by participating students. In addition to online Master Classes taught by prestigious art institution lecturers, we also hosted two intangible cultural heritage-themed camps in Dunhuang, Gansu Province and West Sichuan Province, which are led by instructors from Rhode Island School of Design and Yale University to explore the beauty of China's traditional arts. In Dunhuang, students visited Mogao Caves and Yulin Caves to study Dunhuang-style colored sculpture and mineral camping. In West Sichuan, students were exposed to Asian music and cultural traditions and experienced Tibetan culture. We believe these types of experiences provide students with a unique learning opportunity and perspective, allowing them to go beyond the world they know and are familiar with. The ability to adapt and be open-minded is particularly valuable for those applying to study overseas and must create a solid application portfolio that demonstrates an understanding of and love for art, for different cultures and tradition. We're also bringing students overseas this summer to Japan, the United States and to the United Kingdom through summer schools and campus visits. Understanding that education is the cornerstone of a student's lifetime success both academically and professionally, ACG has prided itself on our ability to establish and maintain highly collaborative relationships with world-renowned institutions. And we look forward to growing our partnership network to assess more world-class educational resources for our students. We expect to enter their overseas study application season soon and are prepared to serve as a trusted guidance supportive to our students during this stressful but exciting times. We remain fully committed to our mission of enabling positive student outcomes and look forward to a busy and productive remainder of the summer as we head into the fall. In the balance of 2024, we're focused on growing our current business, which includes portfolio training services, overseas study counseling and research-based learning services. We remain very confident in ACG's superior competency in the market while continuing to invest in the operational infrastructure to ensure that we're able to provide students with the exceptional education and support system they have come to expect. With that, I'll turn it back over to Kevin.\nKevin Ma: Thanks, Jun. We are pleased our progress in the first half of 2024 and are optimistic that the positive momentum we have experienced thus far will enable us to finish the year on a strong note. As a leading player in China creative art education market, we are proud to see that we have always strived to find the ways to improve our sales and help our students to achieve their full potential. We believe we are on the track to carry out our growth initiatives and drive success for our students and for ACG's shareholders. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no questions at this time. I would like to hand it back over for closing comments.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Audrey Gross, Head of Corporate Communications for Whitehawk Therapeutics. Ms. Gross, please go ahead.\nAudrey Gross: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Whitehawk Therapeutics conference call. We will be presenting slides as part of the live webcast of this call.

We specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. On the call today is Dr. Dave Lennon, our President and CEO; Scott Giacobello, our CFO; and Dr. David Dornan, our newly appointed CSO. Today, we will introduce Whitehawk Therapeutics and provide an overview of Q4 and full year 2024 financial results before turning the line open for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\nDave Lennon : Thanks, Audrey. Hello, everyone. Good morning. Thank you for joining. I'm Dave Lennon, the President and CEO of the newly launched Whitehawk Therapeutics. We are extremely excited about the transformation from Aadi Biosciences to Whitehawk. I look forward to walking you through our vision, strategy, and opportunity, and what we -- the opportunity we have to deliver a meaningful impact for patients with our advanced ADC portfolio. As a reminder, in December, we announced a series of strategic transactions, including the in-licensing of 3 ADCs from Wuxi Biologics, the divestiture of FYARRO to Kaken Pharmaceuticals, and $100 million pipe financing that were subsequently approved during a special meeting of stockholders last month. As a next step in our evolution Aadi Biosciences is now divided into two organizations. Upon the divestiture of Aadi's subsidiary to Kaken. Kaken will assume ownership of the Aadi name, trademark, and the FYARRO business. And today, Aadi Parent Company, relaunches as Whitehawk Therapeutics, formalizing our transition into an ADC-focused company. While we remain rooted in our legacy, that is to make bold choices in applying technology to deliver improved precision oncology therapies, Whitehawk carries several important distinctions. As Aadi, we were focused on mTOR inhibition in rare cancer settings and were built on the foundation of a single commercial product. Conversely, Whitehawk is focused on rapidly progressing a multi-asset portfolio of advanced ADC therapy, all with the broad potential to make a meaningful difference in a large number of different cancer populations. Turning to Slide 6, as Whitehawk, we developed a framework that establishes a clear value proposition and investment thesis as an ADC company. Firstly, we are building on the foundation of established tumor biology. We are deliberate in identifying promising tumor targets that are both clinically validated and broadly overexpressed. By leveraging clinical validation, we know we have drug-able tumor targets. And because these targets are broadly overexpressed, we can apply them to high-potential cancer indications with significant patient populations and unmet needs. While first-generation ADCs offered significant advances for patients, we know they were hindered by limitations largely driven by lack of therapeutic index. To overcome these challenges, we are applying an advanced ADC platform technology that is engineered for minimal off-target toxicity, greater stability and higher therapeutic index compared to first-generation predecessors. Lastly, we are hyper focused on speed and efficiency to major data inflections. We are rapidly advancing our portfolio to the clinic with INDs for all three candidates anticipated in the next 15 months. So what are these candidates? Looking at Slide 7, our portfolio consists of three assets focused on validated tumor targets. HWK-007 targets protein tyrosine kinase 7 or PTK7. PTK7 is an oncofetal pseudokinase that drives early embryonic development. Subsequently as minimally expressed in adult tissues but becomes highly overexpressed in a broad range of tumors as they arise. There are no approved PTK7 ADCs, though it is becoming a popular target for research given this broad and deep overexpression in multiple cancers. HWK-016 is the only known ADC that targets the membrane-bound portion of MUC16, a glycoprotein with low level of expression in normal adult tissues, but often overexpressed and even shed from tumors of female origin, including ovarian cervical and endometrial cancers. Shed MUC16, better known as CA125 is a biomarker for cancer screening and disease monitoring, especially in ovarian cancer. So MUC16 is a widely utilized and clinically validated target for ovarian cancer and was previously studied as an ADC target by Genentech, who had two different ADCs against MUC16. And we have HWK-206, which is designed to address the neuronal target seizure protein 6 or SEZ6. SEZ6 is a CNS limited protein overexpressed in tumors of neuroendocrine origins, most prominent example includes small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, which limited targeted their treatment options exist and class competition is limited. To our knowledge, AbbVie is the -- has the only SEZ6 ADC currently in development. Underlying each of these programs is the advanced ADC technology platform developed by HANGZHOU DAC, known as CPT113. This advanced ADC architecture is based on the novel TOPO1 payload and a highly stable linker chemistry. Though not part of this portfolio, it's important to note that HANGZHOU DAC has two internally develop programs utilizing the exact same platform, DXC006 and DXC1002, these had successful INDs and are currently in dose escalating Phase 1 clinical trials in China. Turning to Slide 8. As you can see, we're working toward rapidly filing INDs with a plan to submit all three INDs in 15 months, as I said. To reiterate, these assets are designed to target proteins that are broadly expressed across multiple tumor types with significant unmet needs. This slide highlights the cancer indications where these targets have established clinical data from previous ADCs and also shows the numerous expansion opportunities showcasing the substantial market potential of the entire portfolio. Starting with HWK-007, this candidate represents a different opportunity -- sorry, differentiated opportunity potentially be among the first wave ADCs in clinical development for high-expressing PTK7 cancers. HWK-007 is currently being evaluated in IND-enabling studies. The Phase 1 trial is planned for non-small cell lung cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with the potential to spend into novel indications, including the full range of gastrointestinal in gynecological cancers. HWK-016 targeting membrane-bound MUC16 is currently being evaluated in IND-enabling study. The Phase 1 trial is planned in ovarian cancer with the potential to expand in additional indications such as endometrial, cervical, and pancreatic cancers. HWK-206 starting SEZ6 is currently in candidate selection, the Phase 1 trials planted in small cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine neoplasias where there are limited treatment options today. Turning now to more detail on the platform on Slide 9. First-generation ADCs were challenged by the high free payload release in circulation, limiting their therapeutic window as high free payload can generate significant off-target side effects. Advanced ADC platforms that are in development today, including the CPT113 platform we utilize across our portfolio, are improving on the limitations of first-generation platforms by engineering three critical components: one, payload. We use TOPO -- a proprietary TOPO1 inhibitor payload that minimizes off-target effects and supports higher therapeutic index; two, linker design. We use a highly stable cleavable linker that supports low free payload release in circulation; and three, pharmacokinetics profile, the ability to support higher DAR with an enhanced PK profile enables optimal dosing. The right-hand side of this slide highlights the generalized concept of therapeutic index improvements that you can expect by implementing an advanced ADC platform as compared to first-generation ADCs. With advanced ADC platforms, we're expanding the lower bound of the minimally effective dose with more potent targeting and increasing the upper bound of maximally tolerated dose with optimized payloads. We, thereby, are increasing the potential dose intensity for which we can treat patients and improve efficacy. To further illustrate this point, let's turn to the next slide. On Slide 10, you can see that we are looking at examples of how a switch from first-generation ADC platform delivers substantial efficacy gains in real-world examples. I won't go through all of these, but as you can see it, agnostic to target or indication, switching from an older platform to advanced ADC technology platform generated notable objective response rate gains ranging from 16 to 45 ORR point improvement. On average, we see a 30-point improvement in the typical switch. This along -- this is alongside coinciding with notable improvement in durability of response, thereby advanced ADC platforms have the potential to disrupt the standard of care for treatment options today and have demonstrated the ability to help many more patients by increasing response rates and time line therapy. So now if we move to Slide 11, we can apply this example to our own portfolio. Starting with PTK7 and share why specifically we're so excited about the potential of our assets. We want to start with the fact that PTK7 has precedented data from Pfizer's first-gene MMAE-based ADC, cofetuzumab pelidotin. Response rates seen in Phase 1 trials were across a range of tumor types tested, including ovarian, lung, which are shown here. Response rates were particularly robust in moderate and high expressing groups with ORR up to 46%. Despite these encouraging signals, co-compete was limited by the reduced dose intensity in narrow therapeutic index driven by toxicities consistent with class effects from the first-generation payload MMAE. So what happens if we apply an advanced ADC platform to this validated tumor target. On Slide 12, what these graphs represent is first placement of the Phase 1 cofe-p data in the context of currently approved late-stage ADC benchmarks for efficacy in lung and ovarian cancer. HWK-007 is a PTK7 switch to an advanced platform. And therefore, if we extrapolate from prior examples, we may expect to generate efficacy gains of 15% to 30%, points more in objective response rate over cofe-p. This level of improvement will be disruptive to first-generation ADC standards of care in lung and ovarian cancer. In both indications, we believe they have an opportunity to significantly surpass the established ADC efficacy bar, representing a meaningful clinical benefit to patients. And this is just the example for HWK-007 and PTK7. We expect similar improvements with our other two programs, which also take advantage of tumor targeting advances in addition to the advanced ADC platform switch, like we show here. We are enthusiastic about the potential of our portfolio and look forward to getting into the clinic quickly. With that, I'll now turn it over to Scott for updates on our financial progress. Scott?\nScott Giacobello : Thanks, Dave. Moving to Slide 14. We ended 2024 with $47.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Following the close of our recent strategic transactions, we expect to have cash and cash equivalents in the range of $170 million to $180 million, including the payment of the upfront and early milestones under the ADC license agreement. We anticipate that cash will fund operations into 2020 based on current plans. FYARRO net product sales were $7.2 million for the fourth quarter, representing 14% growth over the prior year quarter. Full year FYARRO sales were $26 million, an increase of 7% over 2023. Research and development expenses for the quarter increased to $14.3 million compared to $12.8 million in the prior year quarter. For the year, R&D expense amounted to $51 million compared to $48.9 million last year. This increase is driven mainly by in-process R&D expenses of $6 million related to the recently acquired ADC programs, offset in part by reductions in clinical expenses, personnel, and other expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $11.1 million compared to $10.3 million in the same period in 2023. This increase was due mainly to increased legal and consulting expenses offset in part by lower commercial expenses. For the year, SG&A expenses decreased to $36.7 million compared to $44.5 million in the prior year, driven primarily by reductions in commercial and personnel expenses. Operating expenses for the year included $2.6 million of restructuring costs. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $18.3 million compared to $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net loss for the year was $63.7 million compared to $65.8 million in the prior year. I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?\nDave Lennon : Thanks, Scott. Looking to Slide 16. We are enormously excited about the potential of Whitehawk to make a transformative impact to patients with our portfolio. We're advancing three clinically validated tumor targets using next-generation ADC technology with the goal of outperforming first-generation predecessors. With a focus on high potential indications, we aim to file three U.S. INDs within 15 months. And we're well positioned to fund operations, as Scott said, into 2028, covering anticipated clinical inflections. Importantly, Whitehawk is backed by an outstanding veteran team. I'm also pleased to say this includes our recent addition of David Dornan, who joined us as Chief Scientific Officer. Many of you will know David, as the former CSO of Elevation Oncology. David contributes more than 2 decades of experience in oncology drug, discovery and development with deep expertise in ADCs and other targeted cancer therapies. He has a successful track record of separating drugs from discovery stage through the clinic for advanced modalities, including ADCs, encompassing numerous INDs, NDAs and BLAs. His experience at Elevation is particularly relevant as the spearhead of the company's strategic pivot towards a portfolio of ADCs. We welcome David, and glad he is able to join us on the call today. With that, I'll open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Tara Bancroft with TD Securities.\nGreg Weasner: Hi, this is Greg Weasner on for Tara Bancroft. So considering that Regeneron is developing a Mucin 16 targeted bispec antibody for ovarian, how do you anticipate that the clinical activity and safety profile of your ADC might compare to the bispecific approach within this indication? Thank you.\nDave Lennon : Super. Thanks, Greg, for stepping in for Tara, and thanks for the question. I'll start a little bit and then turn it over to David for his comments since he is an expert in this target. I mean the first concept is, obviously, ADCs and bispecific TCEs are very different modalities in terms of their mechanism. Certainly, there's commonality in the tumor targeting. And we're encouraged by the fact that Regeneron uses the same targeting approach to the membrane-bound type MUC16. But obviously, as a TCE that is targeting an immune modulating response, which will be very different from an ADC chemo-based response that we're developing here. We think both are complementary and important options for patient treatment regardless of the tumor target here. So we don't necessarily have a direct comparison we would highlight for this indication, but we do, obviously, pay close attention to that program. But David, do you want to say a little more about MUC16?\nDavid Dornan : Yeah, sure. I think this is what is fair to say with respect to targeting, obviously, the membrane portion that we're targeting MUC16 certainly makes it help avoid antigen sync, as Dave has mentioned in the presentation. And with respect to the different modalities of targeting, I think you specifically asked about the CD3 redirection approach. I think it's fair to say like a CD3 redirection approach, sometimes they have challenges with like a cytokine release like syndrome. So obviously, as a cytotoxic ADC, we don't have the same AE problems in that realm. But obviously, with our ADC, cytox ADCs, they certainly have their own profiles, but the promise of our technology using our stable linker technology really will mitigate that potential risk. And so that's how we feel that positioning wise that this ADC will certainly be differentiated from a CD3 redirected, but largely would have significant gains and efficacy, as Dave already mentioned.\nDave Lennon : Thanks, Greg. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Roger Song with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nLiang Cheng : Good morning, thanks for taking our question. This is Liang Cheng on for Roger. First, congrats on the new chapter. So I guess, question from us. One is on the three targets. So understanding the prevalence there. So maybe could you help us understanding about the distribution of the high, medium, low expression levels for each of these three targets. And the second question is about the financials. So understanding about 2028 runway. So does that cover all the three Phase 1 studies? Thank you.\nDave Lennon : Liang, thanks again. Thanks for joining the call. Good to hear from you again. And thanks for the questions. So on the first question, in terms of the prevalence, obviously, there's a lot of data to cover in context. What we would say is that, first on PTK7, it is one of the most broadly overexpressed tumor targets in development today. And so it impacts a large portion of patients who develop cancer overall, very highly expressed target, also a broad range of tumor types. What we really like about this target is that when it is expressed in patients, it's often expressed at a moderate to high level. So we'll generally find that the majority of patients who express PTK7 do so across different cancers, which we know correlates with potential for improved responses as patients who have higher expression generally responding better. And so we're really encouraged by both of those, the broad expression of PTK7, but also the relatively deep impression that we see in individual patients, a high proportion of patients that potentially could respond very well to therapy. On MUC16, it's a similar story. But I think in MUC16 case, we really have an advantage that MUC16 is a tumor target that tends to increase as the disease progresses and so higher expression is often associated with worse disease. And that is -- allows us to really target the patients who are most in need of care. And secondly, with the circulating CA125, we have a proxy for expression across patients rather than looking at IHC-based expression, we can also screen patients using circulating CA125 biomarker. And so we think, in this case, we really have both this high-level compression, particularly across gynecological cancers, deep expression overall, and ability to monitor that from [Indiscernible]. And then SEZ6. SEZ6 is highly impressed across a broad range of -- well, across the full range of small cell lung cancer. And this has already been typified by AbbVie's program where they're actually not selecting patients with extremely high response rates for non-selected small cell lung cancer patients on that SEZ6. So overall, I think these are not only really interesting targets for the fact that they have key roles in each of these indications, but they're highly and deeply expressed across the vast majority of patients [Indiscernible]. And as well, as we mentioned before, are not yet so competitive, like the TROP2 area or Claudin18.2 or other areas that we believe would be first or second to market on each of these indications or each of these targets. And then your second question on data availability. Our goal is to get meaningful clinical Phase 1 data for all three programs under the current funding that will obviously be slightly different amounts of data for each program, just given that they are staggered by a few months each. But ultimately, our goal in establishing Whitehawk as we did and capital as it is was to ensure that we would generate that meaningful clinical data before our next go back to the market for additional financing. Thanks for the question. Operator next question?\nOperator: I show no further questions at this time in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDave Lennon : Thank you, operator, and thank you to the team and everyone who joined us on the call today. We are really excited about the launch of Whitehawk Therapeutics, a new ADC company out of the transformation we've just performed with Aadi Bioscience. We reiterate these three clinically validated broadly overexpressed tumor targets are leveraging an advanced ADC linker payload architecture with key features that we believe will allow us to outperform first-generation ADCs. We're moving quickly, targeting filing of three U.S. INDs in the next 15 months, including HWK-007 in the second half of 2025, and HWK-016 by the end of this year. With our experienced team and collaborative partners, we are singularly focused on executing to ensure these goals are met. Lastly, upon closing, we expect we will capitalize. And as I mentioned, we have cash to fund our operations into 2028 and with anticipated key clinical data. So thank you for joining us for this introduction of Whitehawk Therapeutics and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Audrey Gross, Head of Corporate Communications for Whitehawk Therapeutics. Ms. Gross, please go ahead.\nAudrey Gross: Thank you.

On the call today is Dr. Dave Lennon, our President and CEO; Scott Giacobello, our CFO; and Dr. David Dornan, our newly appointed CSO. Today, we will introduce Whitehawk Therapeutics and provide an overview of Q4 and full year 2024 financial results before turning the line open for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Dave. Dave?\nDave Lennon : Thanks, Audrey. Hello, everyone. Good morning. Thank you for joining. I'm Dave Lennon, the President and CEO of the newly launched Whitehawk Therapeutics. We are extremely excited about the transformation from Aadi Biosciences to Whitehawk. I look forward to walking you through our vision, strategy, and opportunity, and what we -- the opportunity we have to deliver a meaningful impact for patients with our advanced ADC portfolio. As a reminder, in December, we announced a series of strategic transactions, including the in-licensing of 3 ADCs from Wuxi Biologics, the divestiture of FYARRO to Kaken Pharmaceuticals, and $100 million pipe financing that were subsequently approved during a special meeting of stockholders last month. As a next step in our evolution Aadi Biosciences is now divided into two organizations. Upon the divestiture of Aadi's subsidiary to Kaken. Kaken will assume ownership of the Aadi name, trademark, and the FYARRO business. And today, Aadi Parent Company, relaunches as Whitehawk Therapeutics, formalizing our transition into an ADC-focused company. While we remain rooted in our legacy, that is to make bold choices in applying technology to deliver improved precision oncology therapies, Whitehawk carries several important distinctions. As Aadi, we were focused on mTOR inhibition in rare cancer settings and were built on the foundation of a single commercial product. Conversely, Whitehawk is focused on rapidly progressing a multi-asset portfolio of advanced ADC therapy, all with the broad potential to make a meaningful difference in a large number of different cancer populations. Turning to Slide 6, as Whitehawk, we developed a framework that establishes a clear value proposition and investment thesis as an ADC company. Firstly, we are building on the foundation of established tumor biology. We are deliberate in identifying promising tumor targets that are both clinically validated and broadly overexpressed. By leveraging clinical validation, we know we have drug-able tumor targets. And because these targets are broadly overexpressed, we can apply them to high-potential cancer indications with significant patient populations and unmet needs. While first-generation ADCs offered significant advances for patients, we know they were hindered by limitations largely driven by lack of therapeutic index. To overcome these challenges, we are applying an advanced ADC platform technology that is engineered for minimal off-target toxicity, greater stability and higher therapeutic index compared to first-generation predecessors. Lastly, we are hyper focused on speed and efficiency to major data inflections. We are rapidly advancing our portfolio to the clinic with INDs for all three candidates anticipated in the next 15 months. So what are these candidates? Looking at Slide 7, our portfolio consists of three assets focused on validated tumor targets. HWK-007 targets protein tyrosine kinase 7 or PTK7. PTK7 is an oncofetal pseudokinase that drives early embryonic development. Subsequently as minimally expressed in adult tissues but becomes highly overexpressed in a broad range of tumors as they arise. There are no approved PTK7 ADCs, though it is becoming a popular target for research given this broad and deep overexpression in multiple cancers. HWK-016 is the only known ADC that targets the membrane-bound portion of MUC16, a glycoprotein with low level of expression in normal adult tissues, but often overexpressed and even shed from tumors of female origin, including ovarian cervical and endometrial cancers. Shed MUC16, better known as CA125 is a biomarker for cancer screening and disease monitoring, especially in ovarian cancer. So MUC16 is a widely utilized and clinically validated target for ovarian cancer and was previously studied as an ADC target by Genentech, who had two different ADCs against MUC16. And we have HWK-206, which is designed to address the neuronal target seizure protein 6 or SEZ6. SEZ6 is a CNS limited protein overexpressed in tumors of neuroendocrine origins, most prominent example includes small cell lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, which limited targeted their treatment options exist and class competition is limited. To our knowledge, AbbVie is the -- has the only SEZ6 ADC currently in development. Underlying each of these programs is the advanced ADC technology platform developed by HANGZHOU DAC, known as CPT113. This advanced ADC architecture is based on the novel TOPO1 payload and a highly stable linker chemistry. Though not part of this portfolio, it's important to note that HANGZHOU DAC has two internally develop programs utilizing the exact same platform, DXC006 and DXC1002, these had successful INDs and are currently in dose escalating Phase 1 clinical trials in China. Turning to Slide 8. As you can see, we're working toward rapidly filing INDs with a plan to submit all three INDs in 15 months, as I said. To reiterate, these assets are designed to target proteins that are broadly expressed across multiple tumor types with significant unmet needs. This slide highlights the cancer indications where these targets have established clinical data from previous ADCs and also shows the numerous expansion opportunities showcasing the substantial market potential of the entire portfolio. Starting with HWK-007, this candidate represents a different opportunity -- sorry, differentiated opportunity potentially be among the first wave ADCs in clinical development for high-expressing PTK7 cancers. HWK-007 is currently being evaluated in IND-enabling studies. The Phase 1 trial is planned for non-small cell lung cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with the potential to spend into novel indications, including the full range of gastrointestinal in gynecological cancers. HWK-016 targeting membrane-bound MUC16 is currently being evaluated in IND-enabling study. The Phase 1 trial is planned in ovarian cancer with the potential to expand in additional indications such as endometrial, cervical, and pancreatic cancers. HWK-206 starting SEZ6 is currently in candidate selection, the Phase 1 trials planted in small cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine neoplasias where there are limited treatment options today. Turning now to more detail on the platform on Slide 9. First-generation ADCs were challenged by the high free payload release in circulation, limiting their therapeutic window as high free payload can generate significant off-target side effects. Advanced ADC platforms that are in development today, including the CPT113 platform we utilize across our portfolio, are improving on the limitations of first-generation platforms by engineering three critical components: one, payload. We use TOPO -- a proprietary TOPO1 inhibitor payload that minimizes off-target effects and supports higher therapeutic index; two, linker design. We use a highly stable cleavable linker that supports low free payload release in circulation; and three, pharmacokinetics profile, the ability to support higher DAR with an enhanced PK profile enables optimal dosing. The right-hand side of this slide highlights the generalized concept of therapeutic index improvements that you can expect by implementing an advanced ADC platform as compared to first-generation ADCs. With advanced ADC platforms, we're expanding the lower bound of the minimally effective dose with more potent targeting and increasing the upper bound of maximally tolerated dose with optimized payloads. We, thereby, are increasing the potential dose intensity for which we can treat patients and improve efficacy. To further illustrate this point, let's turn to the next slide. On Slide 10, you can see that we are looking at examples of how a switch from first-generation ADC platform delivers substantial efficacy gains in real-world examples. I won't go through all of these, but as you can see it, agnostic to target or indication, switching from an older platform to advanced ADC technology platform generated notable objective response rate gains ranging from 16 to 45 ORR point improvement. On average, we see a 30-point improvement in the typical switch. This along -- this is alongside coinciding with notable improvement in durability of response, thereby advanced ADC platforms have the potential to disrupt the standard of care for treatment options today and have demonstrated the ability to help many more patients by increasing response rates and time line therapy. So now if we move to Slide 11, we can apply this example to our own portfolio. Starting with PTK7 and share why specifically we're so excited about the potential of our assets. We want to start with the fact that PTK7 has precedented data from Pfizer's first-gene MMAE-based ADC, cofetuzumab pelidotin. Response rates seen in Phase 1 trials were across a range of tumor types tested, including ovarian, lung, which are shown here. Response rates were particularly robust in moderate and high expressing groups with ORR up to 46%. Despite these encouraging signals, co-compete was limited by the reduced dose intensity in narrow therapeutic index driven by toxicities consistent with class effects from the first-generation payload MMAE. So what happens if we apply an advanced ADC platform to this validated tumor target. On Slide 12, what these graphs represent is first placement of the Phase 1 cofe-p data in the context of currently approved late-stage ADC benchmarks for efficacy in lung and ovarian cancer. HWK-007 is a PTK7 switch to an advanced platform. And therefore, if we extrapolate from prior examples, we may expect to generate efficacy gains of 15% to 30%, points more in objective response rate over cofe-p. This level of improvement will be disruptive to first-generation ADC standards of care in lung and ovarian cancer. In both indications, we believe they have an opportunity to significantly surpass the established ADC efficacy bar, representing a meaningful clinical benefit to patients. And this is just the example for HWK-007 and PTK7. We expect similar improvements with our other two programs, which also take advantage of tumor targeting advances in addition to the advanced ADC platform switch, like we show here. We are enthusiastic about the potential of our portfolio and look forward to getting into the clinic quickly. With that, I'll now turn it over to Scott for updates on our financial progress. Scott?\nScott Giacobello : Thanks, Dave. Moving to Slide 14. We ended 2024 with $47.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Following the close of our recent strategic transactions, we expect to have cash and cash equivalents in the range of $170 million to $180 million, including the payment of the upfront and early milestones under the ADC license agreement. We anticipate that cash will fund operations into 2020 based on current plans. FYARRO net product sales were $7.2 million for the fourth quarter, representing 14% growth over the prior year quarter. Full year FYARRO sales were $26 million, an increase of 7% over 2023. Research and development expenses for the quarter increased to $14.3 million compared to $12.8 million in the prior year quarter. For the year, R&D expense amounted to $51 million compared to $48.9 million last year. This increase is driven mainly by in-process R&D expenses of $6 million related to the recently acquired ADC programs, offset in part by reductions in clinical expenses, personnel, and other expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $11.1 million compared to $10.3 million in the same period in 2023. This increase was due mainly to increased legal and consulting expenses offset in part by lower commercial expenses. For the year, SG&A expenses decreased to $36.7 million compared to $44.5 million in the prior year, driven primarily by reductions in commercial and personnel expenses. Operating expenses for the year included $2.6 million of restructuring costs. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $18.3 million compared to $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net loss for the year was $63.7 million compared to $65.8 million in the prior year. I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?\nDave Lennon : Thanks, Scott. Looking to Slide 16. We are enormously excited about the potential of Whitehawk to make a transformative impact to patients with our portfolio. We're advancing three clinically validated tumor targets using next-generation ADC technology with the goal of outperforming first-generation predecessors. With a focus on high potential indications, we aim to file three U.S. INDs within 15 months. And we're well positioned to fund operations, as Scott said, into 2028, covering anticipated clinical inflections. Importantly, Whitehawk is backed by an outstanding veteran team. I'm also pleased to say this includes our recent addition of David Dornan, who joined us as Chief Scientific Officer. Many of you will know David, as the former CSO of Elevation Oncology. David contributes more than 2 decades of experience in oncology drug, discovery and development with deep expertise in ADCs and other targeted cancer therapies. He has a successful track record of separating drugs from discovery stage through the clinic for advanced modalities, including ADCs, encompassing numerous INDs, NDAs and BLAs. His experience at Elevation is particularly relevant as the spearhead of the company's strategic pivot towards a portfolio of ADCs. We welcome David, and glad he is able to join us on the call today. With that, I'll open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Tara Bancroft with TD Securities.\nGreg Weasner: Hi, this is Greg Weasner on for Tara Bancroft. So considering that Regeneron is developing a Mucin 16 targeted bispec antibody for ovarian, how do you anticipate that the clinical activity and safety profile of your ADC might compare to the bispecific approach within this indication? Thank you.\nDave Lennon : Super. Thanks, Greg, for stepping in for Tara, and thanks for the question. I'll start a little bit and then turn it over to David for his comments since he is an expert in this target. I mean the first concept is, obviously, ADCs and bispecific TCEs are very different modalities in terms of their mechanism. Certainly, there's commonality in the tumor targeting. And we're encouraged by the fact that Regeneron uses the same targeting approach to the membrane-bound type MUC16. But obviously, as a TCE that is targeting an immune modulating response, which will be very different from an ADC chemo-based response that we're developing here. We think both are complementary and important options for patient treatment regardless of the tumor target here. So we don't necessarily have a direct comparison we would highlight for this indication, but we do, obviously, pay close attention to that program. But David, do you want to say a little more about MUC16?\nDavid Dornan : Yeah, sure. I think this is what is fair to say with respect to targeting, obviously, the membrane portion that we're targeting MUC16 certainly makes it help avoid antigen sync, as Dave has mentioned in the presentation. And with respect to the different modalities of targeting, I think you specifically asked about the CD3 redirection approach. I think it's fair to say like a CD3 redirection approach, sometimes they have challenges with like a cytokine release like syndrome. So obviously, as a cytotoxic ADC, we don't have the same AE problems in that realm. But obviously, with our ADC, cytox ADCs, they certainly have their own profiles, but the promise of our technology using our stable linker technology really will mitigate that potential risk. And so that's how we feel that positioning wise that this ADC will certainly be differentiated from a CD3 redirected, but largely would have significant gains and efficacy, as Dave already mentioned.\nDave Lennon : Thanks, Greg. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Roger Song with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nLiang Cheng : Good morning, thanks for taking our question. This is Liang Cheng on for Roger. First, congrats on the new chapter. So I guess, question from us. One is on the three targets. So understanding the prevalence there. So maybe could you help us understanding about the distribution of the high, medium, low expression levels for each of these three targets. And the second question is about the financials. So understanding about 2028 runway. So does that cover all the three Phase 1 studies? Thank you.\nDave Lennon : Liang, thanks again. Thanks for joining the call. Good to hear from you again. And thanks for the questions. So on the first question, in terms of the prevalence, obviously, there's a lot of data to cover in context. What we would say is that, first on PTK7, it is one of the most broadly overexpressed tumor targets in development today. And so it impacts a large portion of patients who develop cancer overall, very highly expressed target, also a broad range of tumor types. What we really like about this target is that when it is expressed in patients, it's often expressed at a moderate to high level. So we'll generally find that the majority of patients who express PTK7 do so across different cancers, which we know correlates with potential for improved responses as patients who have higher expression generally responding better. And so we're really encouraged by both of those, the broad expression of PTK7, but also the relatively deep impression that we see in individual patients, a high proportion of patients that potentially could respond very well to therapy. On MUC16, it's a similar story. But I think in MUC16 case, we really have an advantage that MUC16 is a tumor target that tends to increase as the disease progresses and so higher expression is often associated with worse disease. And that is -- allows us to really target the patients who are most in need of care. And secondly, with the circulating CA125, we have a proxy for expression across patients rather than looking at IHC-based expression, we can also screen patients using circulating CA125 biomarker. And so we think, in this case, we really have both this high-level compression, particularly across gynecological cancers, deep expression overall, and ability to monitor that from [Indiscernible]. And then SEZ6. SEZ6 is highly impressed across a broad range of -- well, across the full range of small cell lung cancer. And this has already been typified by AbbVie's program where they're actually not selecting patients with extremely high response rates for non-selected small cell lung cancer patients on that SEZ6. So overall, I think these are not only really interesting targets for the fact that they have key roles in each of these indications, but they're highly and deeply expressed across the vast majority of patients [Indiscernible]. And as well, as we mentioned before, are not yet so competitive, like the TROP2 area or Claudin18.2 or other areas that we believe would be first or second to market on each of these indications or each of these targets. And then your second question on data availability. Our goal is to get meaningful clinical Phase 1 data for all three programs under the current funding that will obviously be slightly different amounts of data for each program, just given that they are staggered by a few months each. But ultimately, our goal in establishing Whitehawk as we did and capital as it is was to ensure that we would generate that meaningful clinical data before our next go back to the market for additional financing. Thanks for the question. Operator next question?\nOperator: I show no further questions at this time in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDave Lennon : Thank you, operator, and thank you to the team and everyone who joined us on the call today.

Today, we will provide an overview of operational activity and financial results for the second quarter of 2024. We will then open the line for questions at the end of the call following closing comments. I'll now turn the call over to Dave for his opening statement. Dave?\nDavid Lennon: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our financial and operational results for the second quarter of 2024. I'd also like to take this opportunity to refresh everyone on Aadi's story where we are today and where we're going in the weeks and months ahead. On Slide five, you'll see at Aadi, we are focused on unlocking the full potential of mTOR inhibition by uniquely combining nab technology and the potent mTOR inhibitor sirolimus. With more complete mTOR target inhibition, greater tumor suppression and a wider therapeutic index, we believe nab-sirolimus has the potential to build on previous mTOR inhibitors to deliver better outcomes for people living with cancers that are dependent on that pathway. We've established the value of this approach with FYARRO for the treatment of advanced malignant PEComa, an ultra-rare soft tissue sarcoma with poor outcomes and high biological evidence of the mTOR pathway activation. FYARRO has cemented its position as preferred treatment for malignant PEComa after just two years on the market. Since launch in February 2022, we have achieved $51.1 million in sales. We're proud of the impact FYARRO has had and will continue to have for patients with this rare and aggressive cancer. Building on this commercial backbone, we're also exploring nab-sirolimus for larger indications across multiple types of mTOR driven tumors. Most advanced of these studies is PRECISION1, a registration-intended tumor-agnostic trial in patients with solid tumors harboring TSC1 or TSC2 in activating alterations. This trial is fully enrolled and expected to complete by the end of the year. In a moment, I'll talk more about PRECISION1 and the opportunity it represents for patients and providers. We're also evaluating nab-sirolimus into mTOR driven cancers with promising potential. The first is advanced or recurrent endometrial type endometrial cancer or EEC, in combination with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole. Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract and one of the few cancers with increasing mortality. There's an estimated 10,000 cases of EEC diagnosed annually in the U.S. alone. Prior clinical studies of mTOR inhibitors combined with letrozole have yielded promising results and recent changes in the recommended standard-of-care for early-stage disease creates a potential opportunity for this combination to be used in the first and second-line settings. The second trial is in neuroendocrine tumors of lung, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas. Neuroendocrine tumors or NETs are rare and have historically low response rate to treatment with oral rapalogs and other agents, which nonetheless are used clinically and recommended in treatment guidelines. In preclinical animal models, nab-sirolimus demonstrated improved target suppression relative to other mTORs, warranting further explanation of nab-sirolimus in this indication. These Phase II open-label studies are both enrolling well, and we look forward to presenting initial data from these trials later this year. Aadi is led by an accomplished team with deep expertise and a track record of responsible capital management with sustained commercial success of PRO, cash runway is anticipated to extend into Q4 2025, with a catalyst-heavy 2024 and 2025 ahead of us. We believe Aadi is well positioned to achieve our goals. Now turning to Slide six. As mentioned, PRECISION1 is registration intended tumor-agnostic trial evaluating patients with solid tumors harboring either TSC1 or TSC2 inactivating alterations. As of May, the trial has fully enrolled 120 patients across a broad array of tumor types. TSC1 or TSC2 driven cancers are found across a wide range of tumor types, clustering in the lung, gastrointestinal, general urinary breast and gynecological locations and are often difficult to treat. Although PRECISION1 is a single trial, TSCI and TSC2 arms are independently evaluated and effectively be viewed as two separate studies, each with its own outcome. Importantly, by design, patients in PRECISION1 have received all standard therapies appropriate for their tumor type and stage of disease. Or, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient would unlikely to tolerate or derive clinically meaningful benefit from the appropriate standard-of-care. In essence, for most patients enrolled in this study, this means they have limited, if any further treatment options, and an extremely poor prognosis. By the design of this trial, nab-sirolimus is the last available line of systemic therapy for these patients and truly test the ability of nab-sirolimus to address TSC1 and TSC2 mutated cancers in the sickest patients. We remain on track for our next plan interim readout, which is expected in Q3 2024. This analysis will include a total of 80 patients who have been followed for a minimum of six months and we'll evaluate the primary endpoint of the study, independently assessed overall response rate. Now looking at Slide seven. As a reminder, in Q4, we provided top line results for the planned interim evaluation of the first 40 patients enrolled in PRECISION1. These data demonstrated sustained tumor reductions in a heavily pretreated population based upon investigator-assessed responses across both arms. For TSC1, we reported an investigator-assessed overall response rate of 26%, which was within the range of our expectations. These responses appear to be early, deep and durable, which is especially noteworthy given this heavily pretreated population with a median of three prior lines of therapy. These responses were seen across four different tumor types, potentially supporting a tumor-agnostic indication. For the TSC2 arm, we reported 11% overall response rate. This arm had a median of 3.5 prior treatments, including 50% who had at least five prior lines of therapy. To put these early interim data in context, the overall response rate for the Phase II trial of Everolimus in a pan-cancer cohort of patients with mTOR pathway alterations was 8% for TSC1 and 6% for TSC2, both in slightly earlier lines of treatment. While this isn't a one-to-one comparison and studies have important differences, these historical data are helpful as we think about the clinical significance of the responses we reported in the first interim analysis, especially in light of the late line of treatment. I also want to highlight that ongoing conversation with experts reinforce this view. We have heard from key opinion leaders that these data are compelling, especially for tumor types in late line for whom disease control is a meaningful outcome. Now turning to Slide eight. It's important to note that PRECISION1 closely follows the most up-to-date guidance from regulators on how they would like to see tumor agnostic studies for targeted therapies run. As we've reiterated today, PRECISION1 is a truly tumor-agnostic trial, enrolling any solid tumor type harboring a TSC1 or TSC2, inactivating alteration. By design, PRECISION1 will not have more than 25% contribution of enrollment from any two tumor types combined. Additionally, patients in PRECISION1 are heavily pretreated with a median of three prior lines of therapy as reported in our December interim data. By contrast, when we look at other targeted therapies that have gained approval in the past, they relied on a cohort approach with significant enrollment from just one or two tumor types, as much as 79% in one case. Patients also appear to be less advanced with these interventions often coming in earlier line settings, which impacts the overall response rate seen in these trials. Based on these precedents, we feel confident in the design of PRECISION1 to meet the standard established for this type of study. We continue to believe that should these results were reported in the one third interim hold or improve in a larger group of patients, we have a path to submission and potential approval for TSC mutations. Now looking at the market opportunity on Slide nine. TSC1 and TSC 2 mutations define a large mutation-driven oncology population with broad distribution amongst tumor indications and specialties. Our latest internal analysis indicates there's approximately 16,000 patients with TSC 1 and 2 mutations across a variety of tumor types, and these mutations are roughly evenly split between genes. Notably, we are seeing an increasing utilization of NGS testing by oncologists to help inform treatment decisions. There are some populations, in particular, for whom NGS testing is more common, so-called high NGS testing specialties. Nearly half of TSC1 and TC2 tumors present in these high NGS testing specialties, which include tumors of gynecological and thoracic origin as well as melanomas and sarcomas. These physicians see roughly half of all TSC1 and TSC2 positive cancers. According to our research for the product profile similar to our interim results to date, high NGS testing specialties indicate they would likely they would be likely to use nab-sirolimus after second and third-line preferred treatments, which aligns with what we've observed in Precision1. We anticipate that market adoption would be led by these specialties with initial uptakes occurring in later line settings where patients are often thoroughly tested for mutations and physicians are looking for unique treatment options. Even if we limit the majority of nab-sirolimus utilization to be in the third line with these high NGS testing segment, TSC1 and CSCI mutated cancers would represent a significant $300 million to $600 million projected market opportunity in the U.S. alone. So if PRECISION1 delivered similar results to our prior interim analysis, we know there is a significant unmet need that we're addressing. We remain confident that we've designed and conducted the appropriate tumor-agnostic trial for the FDA, and we remain bullish on the significant commercial potential for nab-Sirolimus beyond become. With that, I'll now turn it over to Scott for updates on our Q2 financial progress. Scott?\nScott Giacobello: Thanks, Dave. Looking at Slide 11 and starting with FYARRO. FYARRO product sales were $6.2 million for the second quarter, in line with the prior year period and up 15% over Q1. In the quarter, we saw a 14% increase in the number of ordering accounts compared to the first quarter, and growth was observed across all segments, including large accounts. Since launch in February 2022, we've achieved $51.1 million in cumulative sales. FYARRO has a high demand and penetration across both academic and community settings, and we have seen the consistent addition of new accounts ordering FYARRO with more than 200 accounts ordering since launch. Turning to Slide 12. We ended the second quarter of 2024 with $78.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Responsible capital management continues to support a healthy balance sheet and will fund operations into Q4 2025 based on current plans. Research and development expenses for the quarter amounted to $13.1 million compared to $13.3 million in the prior year quarter. R&D expenses were primarily related to the continued progress of the ongoing PRECISION1 trial in the programs in endometrial cancer and NET. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter was $7.9 million compared to $11.8 million in the same period in 2023. This decrease was driven mainly by reduced commercial, marketing and personnel expenses related to the rightsizing of our operations earlier in the year and reduced legal expenses versus the prior year quarter. Net loss for the second quarter was $14.6 million compared to $18 million in the second quarter of 2023. For more information on our financial performance in the second quarter, a detailed discussion of the results reported on this call will be provided in our Form 10-Q. I'll now hand the call back over to Dave.\nDavid Lennon: As discussed today, we're making tremendous progress against our clinical development plans with two sizable markets in TSC1 and TSC2 in activating alterations as well as other mTOR driven cancers. On Slide 14, what you'll see is the back half of the year will be an important time for Aadi, and we look forward to providing the anticipated two thirds interim analysis from PRECISION1 later this quarter, and if appropriate, sharing those data with the FDA thereafter. We expect to complete PRECISION1 by the end of the year. Additionally, we plan to provide an initial look at data coming out of the EEC and NET trials by the end of the year as well. Looking ahead to 2025, we expect to have full results of PRECISION1. And if the data continue to hold, we believe this would form the basis of a filing with the FDA in 2025 as well. With that, we can now open the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Roger Song with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nRoger Song: Thanks for that Dave for taking our question. Maybe we first talk about the PRECEISION, Dave, if we may. Understanding you will have the second interim data in 3Q. First of all, given the first-interim data, what kind of the expectation you have for TSC1 and 2? And the second part of the question is, you say you will discuss with the FDA with the second interim data? And then just curious to what would be the key topic there and then what could be the potential outcome out of the FDA discussion after second interim? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nDavid Lennon: Sure. Thanks, Roger. I'll make a couple of comments and ask Loretta if she has anything she'd like to add. Our PRECISION1 outcome in Q3 will be -- will present -- obviously, just a reminder, this is the primary endpoint analysis on two thirds patients, so 80 patients or 40 patients in each arm. The primary endpoint of independently assessed overall response rate after six months, minimum six months of follow-up, will be reported out along with key demographic and select secondary data. We -- I wouldn't draw any anticipation in terms of the direction of which we see that data going at this point in time. We'll have to wait for that report to see that. But those are the -- that's the information. If you want more specifics, just let me know the follow-up there. And then presumably, since this is representative of the primary endpoint and a preplanned interim analysis, we do think this would be a good foundation for data discussion, data-driven discussion, with the FDA on a potential path to submission, and that would be the goal of that next discussion with the FDA. Loretta, anything you would add to that?\nLoretta Itri: No, Dave, I think you covered it nicely. Thank you.\nRoger Song: Got it. Yes. Thank you. And then since the enrollment for the EEC and NET studies going pretty well. And then just curious what should we expect from the later this year initial data update? Will that be focusing on the -- maybe some of the safety [indiscernible] or you expect to see some clinical activity from those initial data results? And how many patients we should expect to see for the data? Thank you.\nDavid Lennon: Yes. I'll let Loretta start by commenting on where we are with those trials, and I can follow up if anything to add. So Loretta, why don't you comment on this?\nLoretta Itri: Sure. Thanks, Dave, and thank you for the question. For the EEC trial, we have been recruiting very rapidly and which I think reflects the support in the community for this combination. Currently, although we're not giving exact numbers, we have completed enrollment of the entire first cohort and we're well into the second cohort at this point in time. My expectation is that by the end of the year, we will be able to give a fairly full summer report on the first cohort of patients and probably some partial information on the second cohort. So that's EEC. And for the NET program, again, we are accruing quite rapidly, and I would -- I have full expectation that by end of the year, we will be able to report on the first cohort of patients quite completely. Dave, I don't know if you want to add something else?\nDavid Lennon: That's great, Loretta. Thank you. The only thing I might add is, right, that these are two indications where there is precedent data with mTOR inhibitors. And so, one of the opportunities we have here is to compare what we know from prior studies with mTOR inhibitors in these indications to the data we're seeing with nab-sirolimus, which will be something we'll bring forward as we look at that data, depending on the patients that we enroll in these early trials.\nLoretta Itri: Dave, if I might add, I just want to remind everyone that these studies are open label unlike PRECISION. So there will be no problem statistically with reporting the information. Thank you.\nDavid Lennon: Thanks, Roger. Let's -- can we move on to the next set of questions?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Catanzaro with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJoseph Catanzaro: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe following up a bit on sort of what happens post the second 2/3 interim analysis here in the range of outcomes. I'm guessing it's-- I'm wondering if there's any scenario in which the design and execution of the remainder of PRECISION1 is altered or changed in any way. I do recall maybe some speculation that there's a possibility of maybe increasing the target enrollment of the trial, again, depending on sort of the outcome. So maybe you could just speak a little bit more to that on sort of the various scenarios that may play out.\nDavid Lennon: Sure, Joe. Thanks for the question. It's a good one. We have talked in the past about that ability to adjust the trial at this point in time. We will say that the trial has been fully enrolled at this point in time. And so we anticipate being able to report out on the full 120 patient data set in early 2025 once those patients have completed their follow-up period. And so we do feel we're in a good position on the full trial enrollment. In terms of -- so at this point, we don't anticipate any adjustments to the trial given the trajectory that we've seen so far. And we wouldn't anticipate that, that would be an outcome in the short term. That's -- of course, we still would be waiting for our data monitoring committee's recommendation on that as well as kind of internal deliberations. And any changes we do would be part of our disclosure when we report out that data later this quarter.\nJoseph Catanzaro: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe one quick one on FYARRO. I know you've maybe previously have spoken to expectations to continue to see some incremental growth there. Just wondering if that's still your expectations and what would be sort of the driver of that? Thanks.\nDavid Lennon: Yes. I want -- I mean, I would -- do want to highlight that we did have a low Q1, which we discussed had -- likely was being impacted by potentially some cannibalization we were seeing at some of our large centers. Importantly, in Q2, we saw a really strong rebound in demand across all of our key segments of business. And we do believe that that's being sustained as we go into the next quarter. And that we're seeing from a demand perspective, our demand numbers in Q2 actually outperformed what we saw net sales as we had some deductions on a gross-to-net basis related to inventory movements still in Q2. And so we remain very positive on the outlook for continued incremental growth in the business in Q3 and Q4 of this year.\nJoseph Catanzaro: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDavid Lennon: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Next question, Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tara Bancroft with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Greg Weasner [ph] on behalf of Tara Bancroft. Is there any particular tumor type that you're favoring at this point for future trials? Or will this continue to be a pan-tumor approach? And if it's the latter, what guidance does the FDA give for registrational trial requirements? Thank you.\nDavid Lennon: Sure, Greg. Thanks for the question. We -- this is, as I pointed out, I think, and we tried to discuss deeper in the slides, this is truly a tumor-agnostic trial. And therefore, the FDA has no guidance on biasing the trial for any particular indications. And we certainly enroll any and all patients who qualify regardless of tumor type into the trial based on their TSC1/TSC2 status and a few other of the inclusion criteria. So we do believe that this will be conducted and reviewed as a tumor-agnostic trial. Our indication will not be tumor-specific. It will be for that tumor-agnostic label, assuming we submit and gain approval around that. And we don't -- just to reiterate, we don't anticipate or guide this trial PRECISION1 towards any specific tumor types. Obviously, we are very interested in thinking about our endometrial and neuroendocrine specific tumor indications where we know mTOR plays a role regardless of TSC1 and 2 status. And actually, those trials exclude patients with those mutations. And therefore, we are -- or we haven't had any -- I should say we haven't had any patients with those mutations in that trial. And so that's looking at the impact of the mTOR pathway in those specific indications where we know they are potentially more mTOR sensitive.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Wonderful. That's very helpful. And if I can just ask one quick follow-on question. Is there a particular conference that you're targeting for the second interim? Or would this be something that we can expect from a PR?\nDavid Lennon: Yes, we would imagine this will be a company presentation at this point.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ahu Demir with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.\nAhu Demir: Thanks very much for taking my question. I appreciate the additional information with the results today. Two questions from us perhaps one more after the second question would be -- my initial question is, you mentioned the earlier lines of treatment, having a better impact as we have seen in many targeted therapies. Curious if you are planning to maybe disclose this data with the next data release? Are we going to see distinct populations where patients are treated more than three lines of treatment versus earlier lines of treatment? Are you planning to disclose that information?\nDavid Lennon: We'll certainly disclose the response rate overall. I think the question, once we get the data, will be, did we see a difference between lines of treatment, is that meaningful given the data set that we have. So I think, Ahu, that would be a decision that's highly data dependent in terms of what we actually see from the patient population. I can say in the early line -- in the early interim we did in December, we didn't see any -- it was a very small data set, so it's hard to extrapolate, but we didn't see any particular pattern and we had responses spread across different lines of treatment.\nAhu Demir: Makes sense. And my second question is on the endometrial cancer program. You did mention the biggest idea of this trial is to compare it to the other mTOR inhibitors and the patient baseline demographics can impact the trial readouts significantly. So what was the other trial patient demographics look like? Are you planning to focus on those? Any particular populations that you would be targeting? Anything we should pay attention because sometimes it's very challenging when we are comparing apples to oranges and based on demographics that impacts a lot.\nDavid Lennon: Yes. Understood. I probably oversimplified the comparison or a statement in that. So I'm going to allow Loretta to comment on kind of our strategy with the endometrial trial and where we think the real benefit is here for patients. Loretta?\nLoretta Itri: Sure, Dave. Good morning. And thank you for that question. As usual, it's a good one. So the -- the design of the EEC study was largely based on an earlier study that was performed by GOG, the Gynecologic Oncology Group. This is a study GOG-209. And this is actually an older study that established platinum and paclitaxel as the standard-of-care for patients who had advanced endometrial cancer. And in that study, there was a cohort of patients who were chemo-naive. And in that group, they saw a response rate of about 51%. Now this was compared to a later study of the combination of Everolimus and letrozole in which the response rate in the chemo-naive patients was 47%. So not very different than what was seen with platinum and paclitaxel. But what was really riveting was the fact that the PFS reported for the platinum paclitaxel combination was 14 months, which is healthy. But for the Everolimus letrozole combination, it was 28 months, a doubling. And PFS in this population where quality of life is extremely important, really was what was the driver behind the design of our [Indiscernible] advanced stage endometrial cancer. We had an opening a chance to put this combination in frontline or in second line, in some cases, to take a look at how well it would work and to see if we could repeat or improve on the original Everolimus letrozole combination data in a chemo-naive patient population. So that was the basis of the study design and the community has been extremely supportive of this idea and has enrolled very rapidly because of their wish to replace, or try and replace, chemotherapy as frontline treatment for this population. I hope that helped.\nAhu Demir: Yes. Definitely. Thank you, Loretta.\nDavid Lennon: Okay. As I mentioned, Ahu, I do it too simply Loretta does it wonderfully. So, thank you for the question. Do you have a follow-up?\nAhu Demir: Well, one last question I have, Dave, if I may. You have two distinct approaches to assess nab-sirolimus. So curious, when you talk to the KOL community. So where do you see the most excitement? Is it for more of the TSC1/2 approach, is agnostic approach? Or do you see more of an excitement for the endometrial and NET where there is an indication-specific approach?\nDavid Lennon: I'll let Loretta comment first and then...\nLoretta Itri: So first of all, they are totally different populations. Remember that your PRECISION, we are dealing with sort of a pan-representation of specialties. So they don't necessarily talk to each other. But the ones who do talk to each other remain really very bullish on the fact that we are seeing responses in some of these very sick, late-stage patients, as Dave mentioned in his commentary. It's perhaps easier to see the enthusiasm in the community for EEC, where these tend to be a group of specialists who are together all of the time. And they talk about this disease all of the time, and they treat the same kind of patients all of the time. So their excitement is palpable, and they are looking for the next big thing. So immunotherapy was, of course, big and changed the standard-of-care. And now they are looking for a way to replace chemotherapy. And they are hopeful and actually quite vocal that we will fill that gap. So that's as best as I can represent it, I think. Dave, you wanted to say something else?\nDavid Lennon: I think that's a great summary of it, Loretta from first-hand experience. I would say we also went out with the TSC1 and 2 interim analysis, I mentioned and talked to a large number of physicians to get reactions to that profile and understand across different specialties what that reaction would be. And consistently, physicians are quite interested in finding solutions for late-line patients, particularly through targeted mutations where there's identifiable mutation and where often not just overall response rate, but even stable disease is a meaningful outcome for those patients who progress through multiple lines of therapy. And we had excellent reactions to the profile of nab-sirolimus especially amongst folks who are familiar with the mTOR pathway and/or doctors who have seen this product in the PEComa setting. So thank you, Ahu, for the questions. So, Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Burns with HC Wainwright. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Dan on for Rob. Thanks for taking our questions. We wanted to ask, given the data demonstrating preferential tumor uptake for nab-sirolimus versus --sirolimus and Everolimus. Are you thinking of any drug combinations and subsequent target indications for the future? Or to rephrase: any ideas on future directions or expansions? And would you be able to give a little more color around when in this upcoming quarter you expect to report the interim analysis? And I'd like to have some follow-ups, if I could.\nDavid Lennon: Sure. Thanks, Dan, for the questions. Yes. So I think as you point out, we do see that preferential accumulation of sirolimus in the nab-sirolimus combination driven by that nanoparticle-bound albumin technology, and we do think that's one of the key advantages that we have with this product. Obviously, the TSC1 and 2 trial is a monotherapy trial, so there's no combination there. But the EEC trial is in combination with letrozole and the NET trial is a monotherapy or in combination for functional tumors with standard-of-care. In terms of more exploratory combinations that would build on that, we're absolutely looking at those opportunities. But I wouldn't -- I think it's premature for us to comment about that. I think we're looking for these results from these initial trials over the second half to really set the path for the future. And then in terms of timing, all I can say is later in Q3.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. That makes sense. So regarding follow-ups, what are you looking for from the Phase II program in neuroendocrine tumors regarding efficacy and safety? And are there specific tumor types that you expect to see the greatest impact in? Do you have an update -- Sorry.\nDavid Lennon: Go ahead. Finish.\nUnidentified Analyst: Do you also have an updated view on what maximum sales and the PEComas could look like in the United States and around what that would be? And how did -- I'm curious on the paclitaxel versus Everolimus trial. How does those overall survivals compare -- back in the day.\nLoretta Itri: I can.\nDavid Lennon: Yes, I'll let Loretta take the first question. Go ahead.\nLoretta Itri: Okay. So I'll take the last question first because I -- there were so many questions I kind of forgot what the earlier ones are, but I can tell you that the overall survival for the combination of paclitaxel and [Indiscernible], it was 32 months. So -- and it was not reported for the letrozole Everolimus combination. But if the PFS was 28 months, it isn't that far from 32 months overall survival. So you may assume that it was significantly better.\nDavid Lennon: Loretta, thanks. The first question was in regards to the net trial expectations and any particular tumor types that we might see better responses.\nLoretta Itri: Okay. He wants me to answer that. So...\nDavid Lennon: Yes. Go ahead, thanks. If you could add.\nLoretta Itri: So are you -- I wasn't clear with the question; whether you were talking about subtypes of NET because NET occur in different organ sites. We don't actually have enough information. If that is the question. We don't have enough information to know which of the subset NET is going to have a better response rate. You just don't have enough information at this point in time.\nDavid Lennon: Yes. And Dan, if I can add on the NET trial. Historically, mTOR inhibitors have been utilized in the setting or in neuroendocrine tumors. The reality is that those -- I mean, those approvals were driven off of progression-free survival benefit that was demonstrated. NET can be quite indolent and long lasting. And -- but there is benefit that has been derived from mTOR inhibitors in terms of extending time on treatment for those patients relative to other approaches. The reality is though that those prior MTOR inhibitor trials show very low overall response rate, so often in the single-digit setting. And we think the -- an early indication of the potential of our MTOR inhibitor would be to show superior -- or not superior, but because it's not a direct comparison, but to show numbers that would be better in terms of initial response rates that could guide to kind of that longer-term better outcome for those patients. And then on the PEComa sales, we don't guide -- we haven't provided guidance to the ultimate potential in PEComa. What I would say is that PEComa is a very rare indication. We're talking 200 to 300 patients in the U.S. in total. That means we're finding one in a million kind of what we're looking for in terms of finding those patients and getting them to the right treatment setting. Many physicians will never see a PEComa patients. And so therefore, our goal is to continue to hunt and find these patients and make sure they're getting to the right treating physicians so they can get exposed to the potential for nab-sirolimus to support their disease journey. That ultimately is a -- it's hard to predict exactly where that can land over time. What we have said consistently is that we do believe we've penetrated most of the marketplace at this point and any further growth will be incremental.\nUnidentified Analyst: That makes sense. And I apologize for the inundation of questions.\nDavid Lennon: No worries. We take notes as we go. So, thank you, Dan.\nLoretta Itri: I apologize for my short attention span.\nDavid Lennon: Thank you. Operator, are there any other questions on the line?\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Dave Lennon for closing remarks.\nDavid Lennon: Thank you, Audrey, Loretta, Scott, for your comments today. Thank you, everyone, on the call for joining us for today's call. We appreciate your time and look forward to the opportunity in the near future to provide additional updates on our progress. Otherwise, have a great wonderful rest of your day and week and look forward to speaking to you all soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

We will then open the line for questions at the end of the call following closing comments. I'll now turn the call over to Dave for his opening statement. Dave?\nDavid Lennon: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our financial and operational results for the second quarter of 2024. I'd also like to take this opportunity to refresh everyone on Aadi's story where we are today and where we're going in the weeks and months ahead. On Slide five, you'll see at Aadi, we are focused on unlocking the full potential of mTOR inhibition by uniquely combining nab technology and the potent mTOR inhibitor sirolimus. With more complete mTOR target inhibition, greater tumor suppression and a wider therapeutic index, we believe nab-sirolimus has the potential to build on previous mTOR inhibitors to deliver better outcomes for people living with cancers that are dependent on that pathway. We've established the value of this approach with FYARRO for the treatment of advanced malignant PEComa, an ultra-rare soft tissue sarcoma with poor outcomes and high biological evidence of the mTOR pathway activation. FYARRO has cemented its position as preferred treatment for malignant PEComa after just two years on the market. Since launch in February 2022, we have achieved $51.1 million in sales. We're proud of the impact FYARRO has had and will continue to have for patients with this rare and aggressive cancer. Building on this commercial backbone, we're also exploring nab-sirolimus for larger indications across multiple types of mTOR driven tumors. Most advanced of these studies is PRECISION1, a registration-intended tumor-agnostic trial in patients with solid tumors harboring TSC1 or TSC2 in activating alterations. This trial is fully enrolled and expected to complete by the end of the year. In a moment, I'll talk more about PRECISION1 and the opportunity it represents for patients and providers. We're also evaluating nab-sirolimus into mTOR driven cancers with promising potential. The first is advanced or recurrent endometrial type endometrial cancer or EEC, in combination with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole. Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract and one of the few cancers with increasing mortality. There's an estimated 10,000 cases of EEC diagnosed annually in the U.S. alone. Prior clinical studies of mTOR inhibitors combined with letrozole have yielded promising results and recent changes in the recommended standard-of-care for early-stage disease creates a potential opportunity for this combination to be used in the first and second-line settings. The second trial is in neuroendocrine tumors of lung, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas. Neuroendocrine tumors or NETs are rare and have historically low response rate to treatment with oral rapalogs and other agents, which nonetheless are used clinically and recommended in treatment guidelines. In preclinical animal models, nab-sirolimus demonstrated improved target suppression relative to other mTORs, warranting further explanation of nab-sirolimus in this indication. These Phase II open-label studies are both enrolling well, and we look forward to presenting initial data from these trials later this year. Aadi is led by an accomplished team with deep expertise and a track record of responsible capital management with sustained commercial success of PRO, cash runway is anticipated to extend into Q4 2025, with a catalyst-heavy 2024 and 2025 ahead of us. We believe Aadi is well positioned to achieve our goals. Now turning to Slide six. As mentioned, PRECISION1 is registration intended tumor-agnostic trial evaluating patients with solid tumors harboring either TSC1 or TSC2 inactivating alterations. As of May, the trial has fully enrolled 120 patients across a broad array of tumor types. TSC1 or TSC2 driven cancers are found across a wide range of tumor types, clustering in the lung, gastrointestinal, general urinary breast and gynecological locations and are often difficult to treat. Although PRECISION1 is a single trial, TSCI and TSC2 arms are independently evaluated and effectively be viewed as two separate studies, each with its own outcome. Importantly, by design, patients in PRECISION1 have received all standard therapies appropriate for their tumor type and stage of disease. Or, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient would unlikely to tolerate or derive clinically meaningful benefit from the appropriate standard-of-care. In essence, for most patients enrolled in this study, this means they have limited, if any further treatment options, and an extremely poor prognosis. By the design of this trial, nab-sirolimus is the last available line of systemic therapy for these patients and truly test the ability of nab-sirolimus to address TSC1 and TSC2 mutated cancers in the sickest patients. We remain on track for our next plan interim readout, which is expected in Q3 2024. This analysis will include a total of 80 patients who have been followed for a minimum of six months and we'll evaluate the primary endpoint of the study, independently assessed overall response rate. Now looking at Slide seven. As a reminder, in Q4, we provided top line results for the planned interim evaluation of the first 40 patients enrolled in PRECISION1. These data demonstrated sustained tumor reductions in a heavily pretreated population based upon investigator-assessed responses across both arms. For TSC1, we reported an investigator-assessed overall response rate of 26%, which was within the range of our expectations. These responses appear to be early, deep and durable, which is especially noteworthy given this heavily pretreated population with a median of three prior lines of therapy. These responses were seen across four different tumor types, potentially supporting a tumor-agnostic indication. For the TSC2 arm, we reported 11% overall response rate. This arm had a median of 3.5 prior treatments, including 50% who had at least five prior lines of therapy. To put these early interim data in context, the overall response rate for the Phase II trial of Everolimus in a pan-cancer cohort of patients with mTOR pathway alterations was 8% for TSC1 and 6% for TSC2, both in slightly earlier lines of treatment. While this isn't a one-to-one comparison and studies have important differences, these historical data are helpful as we think about the clinical significance of the responses we reported in the first interim analysis, especially in light of the late line of treatment. I also want to highlight that ongoing conversation with experts reinforce this view. We have heard from key opinion leaders that these data are compelling, especially for tumor types in late line for whom disease control is a meaningful outcome. Now turning to Slide eight. It's important to note that PRECISION1 closely follows the most up-to-date guidance from regulators on how they would like to see tumor agnostic studies for targeted therapies run. As we've reiterated today, PRECISION1 is a truly tumor-agnostic trial, enrolling any solid tumor type harboring a TSC1 or TSC2, inactivating alteration. By design, PRECISION1 will not have more than 25% contribution of enrollment from any two tumor types combined. Additionally, patients in PRECISION1 are heavily pretreated with a median of three prior lines of therapy as reported in our December interim data. By contrast, when we look at other targeted therapies that have gained approval in the past, they relied on a cohort approach with significant enrollment from just one or two tumor types, as much as 79% in one case. Patients also appear to be less advanced with these interventions often coming in earlier line settings, which impacts the overall response rate seen in these trials. Based on these precedents, we feel confident in the design of PRECISION1 to meet the standard established for this type of study. We continue to believe that should these results were reported in the one third interim hold or improve in a larger group of patients, we have a path to submission and potential approval for TSC mutations. Now looking at the market opportunity on Slide nine. TSC1 and TSC 2 mutations define a large mutation-driven oncology population with broad distribution amongst tumor indications and specialties. Our latest internal analysis indicates there's approximately 16,000 patients with TSC 1 and 2 mutations across a variety of tumor types, and these mutations are roughly evenly split between genes. Notably, we are seeing an increasing utilization of NGS testing by oncologists to help inform treatment decisions. There are some populations, in particular, for whom NGS testing is more common, so-called high NGS testing specialties. Nearly half of TSC1 and TC2 tumors present in these high NGS testing specialties, which include tumors of gynecological and thoracic origin as well as melanomas and sarcomas. These physicians see roughly half of all TSC1 and TSC2 positive cancers. According to our research for the product profile similar to our interim results to date, high NGS testing specialties indicate they would likely they would be likely to use nab-sirolimus after second and third-line preferred treatments, which aligns with what we've observed in Precision1. We anticipate that market adoption would be led by these specialties with initial uptakes occurring in later line settings where patients are often thoroughly tested for mutations and physicians are looking for unique treatment options. Even if we limit the majority of nab-sirolimus utilization to be in the third line with these high NGS testing segment, TSC1 and CSCI mutated cancers would represent a significant $300 million to $600 million projected market opportunity in the U.S. alone. So if PRECISION1 delivered similar results to our prior interim analysis, we know there is a significant unmet need that we're addressing. We remain confident that we've designed and conducted the appropriate tumor-agnostic trial for the FDA, and we remain bullish on the significant commercial potential for nab-Sirolimus beyond become. With that, I'll now turn it over to Scott for updates on our Q2 financial progress. Scott?\nScott Giacobello: Thanks, Dave. Looking at Slide 11 and starting with FYARRO. FYARRO product sales were $6.2 million for the second quarter, in line with the prior year period and up 15% over Q1. In the quarter, we saw a 14% increase in the number of ordering accounts compared to the first quarter, and growth was observed across all segments, including large accounts. Since launch in February 2022, we've achieved $51.1 million in cumulative sales. FYARRO has a high demand and penetration across both academic and community settings, and we have seen the consistent addition of new accounts ordering FYARRO with more than 200 accounts ordering since launch. Turning to Slide 12. We ended the second quarter of 2024 with $78.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Responsible capital management continues to support a healthy balance sheet and will fund operations into Q4 2025 based on current plans. Research and development expenses for the quarter amounted to $13.1 million compared to $13.3 million in the prior year quarter. R&D expenses were primarily related to the continued progress of the ongoing PRECISION1 trial in the programs in endometrial cancer and NET. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter was $7.9 million compared to $11.8 million in the same period in 2023. This decrease was driven mainly by reduced commercial, marketing and personnel expenses related to the rightsizing of our operations earlier in the year and reduced legal expenses versus the prior year quarter. Net loss for the second quarter was $14.6 million compared to $18 million in the second quarter of 2023. For more information on our financial performance in the second quarter, a detailed discussion of the results reported on this call will be provided in our Form 10-Q. I'll now hand the call back over to Dave.\nDavid Lennon: As discussed today, we're making tremendous progress against our clinical development plans with two sizable markets in TSC1 and TSC2 in activating alterations as well as other mTOR driven cancers. On Slide 14, what you'll see is the back half of the year will be an important time for Aadi, and we look forward to providing the anticipated two thirds interim analysis from PRECISION1 later this quarter, and if appropriate, sharing those data with the FDA thereafter. We expect to complete PRECISION1 by the end of the year. Additionally, we plan to provide an initial look at data coming out of the EEC and NET trials by the end of the year as well. Looking ahead to 2025, we expect to have full results of PRECISION1. And if the data continue to hold, we believe this would form the basis of a filing with the FDA in 2025 as well. With that, we can now open the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Roger Song with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nRoger Song: Thanks for that Dave for taking our question. Maybe we first talk about the PRECEISION, Dave, if we may. Understanding you will have the second interim data in 3Q. First of all, given the first-interim data, what kind of the expectation you have for TSC1 and 2? And the second part of the question is, you say you will discuss with the FDA with the second interim data? And then just curious to what would be the key topic there and then what could be the potential outcome out of the FDA discussion after second interim? I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nDavid Lennon: Sure. Thanks, Roger. I'll make a couple of comments and ask Loretta if she has anything she'd like to add. Our PRECISION1 outcome in Q3 will be -- will present -- obviously, just a reminder, this is the primary endpoint analysis on two thirds patients, so 80 patients or 40 patients in each arm. The primary endpoint of independently assessed overall response rate after six months, minimum six months of follow-up, will be reported out along with key demographic and select secondary data. We -- I wouldn't draw any anticipation in terms of the direction of which we see that data going at this point in time. We'll have to wait for that report to see that. But those are the -- that's the information. If you want more specifics, just let me know the follow-up there. And then presumably, since this is representative of the primary endpoint and a preplanned interim analysis, we do think this would be a good foundation for data discussion, data-driven discussion, with the FDA on a potential path to submission, and that would be the goal of that next discussion with the FDA. Loretta, anything you would add to that?\nLoretta Itri: No, Dave, I think you covered it nicely. Thank you.\nRoger Song: Got it. Yes. Thank you. And then since the enrollment for the EEC and NET studies going pretty well. And then just curious what should we expect from the later this year initial data update? Will that be focusing on the -- maybe some of the safety [indiscernible] or you expect to see some clinical activity from those initial data results? And how many patients we should expect to see for the data? Thank you.\nDavid Lennon: Yes. I'll let Loretta start by commenting on where we are with those trials, and I can follow up if anything to add. So Loretta, why don't you comment on this?\nLoretta Itri: Sure. Thanks, Dave, and thank you for the question. For the EEC trial, we have been recruiting very rapidly and which I think reflects the support in the community for this combination. Currently, although we're not giving exact numbers, we have completed enrollment of the entire first cohort and we're well into the second cohort at this point in time. My expectation is that by the end of the year, we will be able to give a fairly full summer report on the first cohort of patients and probably some partial information on the second cohort. So that's EEC. And for the NET program, again, we are accruing quite rapidly, and I would -- I have full expectation that by end of the year, we will be able to report on the first cohort of patients quite completely. Dave, I don't know if you want to add something else?\nDavid Lennon: That's great, Loretta. Thank you. The only thing I might add is, right, that these are two indications where there is precedent data with mTOR inhibitors. And so, one of the opportunities we have here is to compare what we know from prior studies with mTOR inhibitors in these indications to the data we're seeing with nab-sirolimus, which will be something we'll bring forward as we look at that data, depending on the patients that we enroll in these early trials.\nLoretta Itri: Dave, if I might add, I just want to remind everyone that these studies are open label unlike PRECISION. So there will be no problem statistically with reporting the information. Thank you.\nDavid Lennon: Thanks, Roger. Let's -- can we move on to the next set of questions?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Catanzaro with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJoseph Catanzaro: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe following up a bit on sort of what happens post the second 2/3 interim analysis here in the range of outcomes. I'm guessing it's-- I'm wondering if there's any scenario in which the design and execution of the remainder of PRECISION1 is altered or changed in any way. I do recall maybe some speculation that there's a possibility of maybe increasing the target enrollment of the trial, again, depending on sort of the outcome. So maybe you could just speak a little bit more to that on sort of the various scenarios that may play out.\nDavid Lennon: Sure, Joe. Thanks for the question. It's a good one. We have talked in the past about that ability to adjust the trial at this point in time. We will say that the trial has been fully enrolled at this point in time. And so we anticipate being able to report out on the full 120 patient data set in early 2025 once those patients have completed their follow-up period. And so we do feel we're in a good position on the full trial enrollment. In terms of -- so at this point, we don't anticipate any adjustments to the trial given the trajectory that we've seen so far. And we wouldn't anticipate that, that would be an outcome in the short term. That's -- of course, we still would be waiting for our data monitoring committee's recommendation on that as well as kind of internal deliberations. And any changes we do would be part of our disclosure when we report out that data later this quarter.\nJoseph Catanzaro: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe one quick one on FYARRO. I know you've maybe previously have spoken to expectations to continue to see some incremental growth there. Just wondering if that's still your expectations and what would be sort of the driver of that? Thanks.\nDavid Lennon: Yes. I want -- I mean, I would -- do want to highlight that we did have a low Q1, which we discussed had -- likely was being impacted by potentially some cannibalization we were seeing at some of our large centers. Importantly, in Q2, we saw a really strong rebound in demand across all of our key segments of business. And we do believe that that's being sustained as we go into the next quarter. And that we're seeing from a demand perspective, our demand numbers in Q2 actually outperformed what we saw net sales as we had some deductions on a gross-to-net basis related to inventory movements still in Q2. And so we remain very positive on the outlook for continued incremental growth in the business in Q3 and Q4 of this year.\nJoseph Catanzaro: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDavid Lennon: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Next question, Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tara Bancroft with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Greg Weasner [ph] on behalf of Tara Bancroft. Is there any particular tumor type that you're favoring at this point for future trials? Or will this continue to be a pan-tumor approach? And if it's the latter, what guidance does the FDA give for registrational trial requirements? Thank you.\nDavid Lennon: Sure, Greg. Thanks for the question. We -- this is, as I pointed out, I think, and we tried to discuss deeper in the slides, this is truly a tumor-agnostic trial. And therefore, the FDA has no guidance on biasing the trial for any particular indications. And we certainly enroll any and all patients who qualify regardless of tumor type into the trial based on their TSC1/TSC2 status and a few other of the inclusion criteria. So we do believe that this will be conducted and reviewed as a tumor-agnostic trial. Our indication will not be tumor-specific. It will be for that tumor-agnostic label, assuming we submit and gain approval around that. And we don't -- just to reiterate, we don't anticipate or guide this trial PRECISION1 towards any specific tumor types. Obviously, we are very interested in thinking about our endometrial and neuroendocrine specific tumor indications where we know mTOR plays a role regardless of TSC1 and 2 status. And actually, those trials exclude patients with those mutations. And therefore, we are -- or we haven't had any -- I should say we haven't had any patients with those mutations in that trial. And so that's looking at the impact of the mTOR pathway in those specific indications where we know they are potentially more mTOR sensitive.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Wonderful. That's very helpful. And if I can just ask one quick follow-on question. Is there a particular conference that you're targeting for the second interim? Or would this be something that we can expect from a PR?\nDavid Lennon: Yes, we would imagine this will be a company presentation at this point.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ahu Demir with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.\nAhu Demir: Thanks very much for taking my question. I appreciate the additional information with the results today. Two questions from us perhaps one more after the second question would be -- my initial question is, you mentioned the earlier lines of treatment, having a better impact as we have seen in many targeted therapies. Curious if you are planning to maybe disclose this data with the next data release? Are we going to see distinct populations where patients are treated more than three lines of treatment versus earlier lines of treatment? Are you planning to disclose that information?\nDavid Lennon: We'll certainly disclose the response rate overall. I think the question, once we get the data, will be, did we see a difference between lines of treatment, is that meaningful given the data set that we have. So I think, Ahu, that would be a decision that's highly data dependent in terms of what we actually see from the patient population. I can say in the early line -- in the early interim we did in December, we didn't see any -- it was a very small data set, so it's hard to extrapolate, but we didn't see any particular pattern and we had responses spread across different lines of treatment.\nAhu Demir: Makes sense. And my second question is on the endometrial cancer program. You did mention the biggest idea of this trial is to compare it to the other mTOR inhibitors and the patient baseline demographics can impact the trial readouts significantly. So what was the other trial patient demographics look like? Are you planning to focus on those? Any particular populations that you would be targeting? Anything we should pay attention because sometimes it's very challenging when we are comparing apples to oranges and based on demographics that impacts a lot.\nDavid Lennon: Yes. Understood. I probably oversimplified the comparison or a statement in that. So I'm going to allow Loretta to comment on kind of our strategy with the endometrial trial and where we think the real benefit is here for patients. Loretta?\nLoretta Itri: Sure, Dave. Good morning. And thank you for that question. As usual, it's a good one. So the -- the design of the EEC study was largely based on an earlier study that was performed by GOG, the Gynecologic Oncology Group. This is a study GOG-209. And this is actually an older study that established platinum and paclitaxel as the standard-of-care for patients who had advanced endometrial cancer. And in that study, there was a cohort of patients who were chemo-naive. And in that group, they saw a response rate of about 51%. Now this was compared to a later study of the combination of Everolimus and letrozole in which the response rate in the chemo-naive patients was 47%. So not very different than what was seen with platinum and paclitaxel. But what was really riveting was the fact that the PFS reported for the platinum paclitaxel combination was 14 months, which is healthy. But for the Everolimus letrozole combination, it was 28 months, a doubling. And PFS in this population where quality of life is extremely important, really was what was the driver behind the design of our [Indiscernible] advanced stage endometrial cancer. We had an opening a chance to put this combination in frontline or in second line, in some cases, to take a look at how well it would work and to see if we could repeat or improve on the original Everolimus letrozole combination data in a chemo-naive patient population. So that was the basis of the study design and the community has been extremely supportive of this idea and has enrolled very rapidly because of their wish to replace, or try and replace, chemotherapy as frontline treatment for this population. I hope that helped.\nAhu Demir: Yes. Definitely. Thank you, Loretta.\nDavid Lennon: Okay. As I mentioned, Ahu, I do it too simply Loretta does it wonderfully. So, thank you for the question. Do you have a follow-up?\nAhu Demir: Well, one last question I have, Dave, if I may. You have two distinct approaches to assess nab-sirolimus. So curious, when you talk to the KOL community. So where do you see the most excitement? Is it for more of the TSC1/2 approach, is agnostic approach? Or do you see more of an excitement for the endometrial and NET where there is an indication-specific approach?\nDavid Lennon: I'll let Loretta comment first and then...\nLoretta Itri: So first of all, they are totally different populations. Remember that your PRECISION, we are dealing with sort of a pan-representation of specialties. So they don't necessarily talk to each other. But the ones who do talk to each other remain really very bullish on the fact that we are seeing responses in some of these very sick, late-stage patients, as Dave mentioned in his commentary. It's perhaps easier to see the enthusiasm in the community for EEC, where these tend to be a group of specialists who are together all of the time. And they talk about this disease all of the time, and they treat the same kind of patients all of the time. So their excitement is palpable, and they are looking for the next big thing. So immunotherapy was, of course, big and changed the standard-of-care. And now they are looking for a way to replace chemotherapy. And they are hopeful and actually quite vocal that we will fill that gap. So that's as best as I can represent it, I think. Dave, you wanted to say something else?\nDavid Lennon: I think that's a great summary of it, Loretta from first-hand experience. I would say we also went out with the TSC1 and 2 interim analysis, I mentioned and talked to a large number of physicians to get reactions to that profile and understand across different specialties what that reaction would be. And consistently, physicians are quite interested in finding solutions for late-line patients, particularly through targeted mutations where there's identifiable mutation and where often not just overall response rate, but even stable disease is a meaningful outcome for those patients who progress through multiple lines of therapy. And we had excellent reactions to the profile of nab-sirolimus especially amongst folks who are familiar with the mTOR pathway and/or doctors who have seen this product in the PEComa setting. So thank you, Ahu, for the questions. So, Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Burns with HC Wainwright. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Dan on for Rob. Thanks for taking our questions. We wanted to ask, given the data demonstrating preferential tumor uptake for nab-sirolimus versus --sirolimus and Everolimus. Are you thinking of any drug combinations and subsequent target indications for the future? Or to rephrase: any ideas on future directions or expansions? And would you be able to give a little more color around when in this upcoming quarter you expect to report the interim analysis? And I'd like to have some follow-ups, if I could.\nDavid Lennon: Sure. Thanks, Dan, for the questions. Yes. So I think as you point out, we do see that preferential accumulation of sirolimus in the nab-sirolimus combination driven by that nanoparticle-bound albumin technology, and we do think that's one of the key advantages that we have with this product. Obviously, the TSC1 and 2 trial is a monotherapy trial, so there's no combination there. But the EEC trial is in combination with letrozole and the NET trial is a monotherapy or in combination for functional tumors with standard-of-care. In terms of more exploratory combinations that would build on that, we're absolutely looking at those opportunities. But I wouldn't -- I think it's premature for us to comment about that. I think we're looking for these results from these initial trials over the second half to really set the path for the future. And then in terms of timing, all I can say is later in Q3.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. That makes sense. So regarding follow-ups, what are you looking for from the Phase II program in neuroendocrine tumors regarding efficacy and safety? And are there specific tumor types that you expect to see the greatest impact in? Do you have an update -- Sorry.\nDavid Lennon: Go ahead. Finish.\nUnidentified Analyst: Do you also have an updated view on what maximum sales and the PEComas could look like in the United States and around what that would be? And how did -- I'm curious on the paclitaxel versus Everolimus trial. How does those overall survivals compare -- back in the day.\nLoretta Itri: I can.\nDavid Lennon: Yes, I'll let Loretta take the first question. Go ahead.\nLoretta Itri: Okay. So I'll take the last question first because I -- there were so many questions I kind of forgot what the earlier ones are, but I can tell you that the overall survival for the combination of paclitaxel and [Indiscernible], it was 32 months. So -- and it was not reported for the letrozole Everolimus combination. But if the PFS was 28 months, it isn't that far from 32 months overall survival. So you may assume that it was significantly better.\nDavid Lennon: Loretta, thanks. The first question was in regards to the net trial expectations and any particular tumor types that we might see better responses.\nLoretta Itri: Okay. He wants me to answer that. So...\nDavid Lennon: Yes. Go ahead, thanks. If you could add.\nLoretta Itri: So are you -- I wasn't clear with the question; whether you were talking about subtypes of NET because NET occur in different organ sites. We don't actually have enough information. If that is the question. We don't have enough information to know which of the subset NET is going to have a better response rate. You just don't have enough information at this point in time.\nDavid Lennon: Yes. And Dan, if I can add on the NET trial. Historically, mTOR inhibitors have been utilized in the setting or in neuroendocrine tumors. The reality is that those -- I mean, those approvals were driven off of progression-free survival benefit that was demonstrated. NET can be quite indolent and long lasting. And -- but there is benefit that has been derived from mTOR inhibitors in terms of extending time on treatment for those patients relative to other approaches. The reality is though that those prior MTOR inhibitor trials show very low overall response rate, so often in the single-digit setting. And we think the -- an early indication of the potential of our MTOR inhibitor would be to show superior -- or not superior, but because it's not a direct comparison, but to show numbers that would be better in terms of initial response rates that could guide to kind of that longer-term better outcome for those patients. And then on the PEComa sales, we don't guide -- we haven't provided guidance to the ultimate potential in PEComa. What I would say is that PEComa is a very rare indication. We're talking 200 to 300 patients in the U.S. in total. That means we're finding one in a million kind of what we're looking for in terms of finding those patients and getting them to the right treatment setting. Many physicians will never see a PEComa patients. And so therefore, our goal is to continue to hunt and find these patients and make sure they're getting to the right treating physicians so they can get exposed to the potential for nab-sirolimus to support their disease journey. That ultimately is a -- it's hard to predict exactly where that can land over time. What we have said consistently is that we do believe we've penetrated most of the marketplace at this point and any further growth will be incremental.\nUnidentified Analyst: That makes sense. And I apologize for the inundation of questions.\nDavid Lennon: No worries. We take notes as we go. So, thank you, Dan.\nLoretta Itri: I apologize for my short attention span.\nDavid Lennon: Thank you. Operator, are there any other questions on the line?\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Dave Lennon for closing remarks.\nDavid Lennon: Thank you, Audrey, Loretta, Scott, for your comments today. Thank you, everyone, on the call for joining us for today's call. We appreciate your time and look forward to the opportunity in the near future to provide additional updates on our progress. Otherwise, have a great wonderful rest of your day and week and look forward to speaking to you all soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Audrey Gross, Head of Corporate Communications for Aadi Bioscience. Ms. Gross, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Aadi Bioscience conference call to provide an operational update and review results for the first quarter of 2024.

Dave?\nDave Lennon: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2024. At Aadi, we're focused on unlocking the full potential of mTOR inhibition by uniquely combining nab technology in the potent mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus. We believe nab-sirolimus has the potential to deliver deeper inhibition of the mTOR pathway and ultimately better outcomes for people living with cancers that are dependent on that pathway. Today, I'm pleased to announce that a registration-intended PRECISION1 trial is now fully enrolled across a broad array of tumor types. This is an important milestone as we seek to understand the potential of nab-sirolimus for patients with solid tumors harboring either TSC1 or TSC2 inactivating alterations, a sizable market. Our latest internal analysis indicates there are approximately 16,000 patients with these mutations across a variety of tumor types, with mutations roughly evenly split between genes. Each mutation represents a potential multibillion-dollar total addressable market for nab-sirolimus. TSC1 or TSC2-driven cancers are found across a wider range of tumor types, clustering in lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, breast and gynecological locations and are often difficult to treat. We believe PRECISION1 is a cutting-edge trial, testing our innovative therapy, nab-sirolimus in these cancers. Although PRECISION1 is designed as a single trial, each arm is independently evaluated, providing us with the ability to assess one arm separately from the other. Given this design, PRECISION1 can effectively be viewed as two separate studies, each with its own outcome. As a reminder, in Q4, we provided top line results from a planned interim evaluation of the first 40 patients enrolled in PRECISION1. These data demonstrated sustained tumor reductions in a heavily pretreated population based on investigator-assessed responses in the first 40 patients across both arms. Of note, for the TSC1 arm, we reported an investigator-assessed overall response rate of 26%, which was within the range of our expectations. These responses appear to be early, deep and durable, which is especially noteworthy given this heavily pretreated population with a median of three prior lines of therapy. Lastly, these responses were seen across four different tumor types, potentially supporting a tumor-agnostic indication. I want to highlight that ongoing conversations with experts reinforce our view of the clinical significance of the responses we reported from the first interim analysis, especially in the late-line treatment in both patient groups. We continue to believe that should these results hold or improve in larger group of patients, we have a path to submission and potential approval for TSC mutations. With the trial now fully enrolled, we remain on track for our next planned interim readout, which is expected in Q3 of 2024. This highly anticipated analysis will include a total of 80 patients, who have been followed for a minimum of six months and will evaluate the primary endpoint of the study, independently assessed overall response rate as opposed to our December interim analysis, which reported investigator-assessed responses. Looking ahead, we expect the study to be completed by the end of 2024 with full data in 2025. In addition to PRECISION1, the Phase II trials for two promising mTOR-driven cancer targets continue to enroll well. As a reminder on these two trials, the first is evaluating the therapeutic potential of nab-sirolimus in advanced or recurrent endometrioid-type endometrial cancer or EEC in combination with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole. Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract and one of the few cancers with increasing mortality. There is an estimated 10,000 cases of EEC diagnosed annually in the US alone. Prior clinical studies of mTOR inhibitors combined with letrozole have yielded promising results and recent changes in the recommended standard-of-care for early-stage disease creates a potential opportunity for this combination to be used in the first and second-line settings. The second trial is evaluating nab-sirolimus in neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs. NETs are rare with approximately 3,500 cases a year. NETs have a historically low response rate to the treatment with oral rapalogs or other agents, which nonetheless are used clinically and recommended in treatment guidelines. In preclinical animal models, nab-sirolimus demonstrated improved target suppression relative to other mTORs, warranting further exploration of nab-sirolimus in the clinical setting for NETs. We're excited about this trial because it provides the opportunity to demonstrate what we believe is nab-sirolimus' best-in-class efficacy in a known mTOR-sensitive tumor type. Overactivation and dysregulation of the mTOR pathway is commonly found in various tumors and the unique delivery and excellent safety profile of nab-sirolimus provides the opportunity to combat these difficult to treat cancers. As such, we think these are promising indications and are eager to present initial data from these open label studies later this year. As a final update to our development plans, today, we announced that we have terminated our collaboration and supply agreement with Mirati, now BMS. That was evaluating the combination of its adagrasib, a KRAS selective inhibitor, and nab-sirolimus in KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. At our request, we mutually agreed with BMS to discontinue this early phase trial, which enables us to prioritize the evaluation of nab-sirolimus in our ongoing Phase II trials for the promising indications of EEC and NETs. Turning now to FYARRO. FYARRO continues to perform well with net product sales for the quarter of $5.4 million. For a bit of context, this is a decrease from prior year and reflects Q1 changes in distributor ordering patterns and fewer new commercial patient initiations in Q1 than historical average. Swings in what is actually a very small number of patients may be due in part to cannibalization at top accounts, where we're seeing robust enrollment into our current clinical trials. We believe this will correct itself in subsequent quarters and we expect a return to sales growth in Q2. FYARRO has cemented its position as the preferred treatment for malignant PEComa after just two years on the market. We have high penetration across academic and community settings and have seen the consistent addition of new accounts ordering FYARRO every quarter now with more than 200 accounts ordering since launch. We are proud of the impact FYARRO has had and will continue to have for patients with this rare and aggressive cancer. With sustained commercial success of FYARRO, cash runway into Q4 2025 and a catalyst heavy 12 months ahead of us, we are well positioned to realize our ambition of becoming a multi-indication precision oncology company. I will now turn the call over to Scott for updates on our financial progress. Scott?\nScott Giacobello: Thanks, Dave. We ended the first quarter 2024 with $88.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Responsible capital management, including measures implemented in early 2024 to streamline our operations and reduce costs, continue to support a healthy balance sheet that will fund operations into Q4 2025 based on current plans. FYARRO net product sales were $5.4 million for the first quarter, representing an 8.8% decrease from the prior year period. As Dave mentioned, this decrease was due in part to distributor ordering patterns in Q1, which we expect will correct in future quarters as well as lower commercial patient initiations. Research and development expenses for the quarter increased to $13.6 million compared to $11 million in the prior year quarter. This increase is primarily related to the continued progress of the ongoing PRECISION1 trial, which is now fully enrolled and the programs in endometrial cancer and NETs. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter were $10.6 million compared to $11.2 million in the same period in 2023. This decrease is due mainly to reduced legal and consulting expenses versus the prior year, offset in part by severance costs related to the streamlining of our operations. Net loss for the first quarter was $18.3 million compared to $15.2 million in the first quarter of 2023. For more information on our financial performance in the first quarter, a detailed discussion of the results reported on this call will be provided in our Form 10-Q to be filed later today. I'll now hand the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Scott. I'm proud of the strides we've made already this year. We're making tremendous progress against our clinical development plans with two sizable markets in TSC1 and TSC2 inactivating alterations as well as other mTOR-driven cancers. We look forward to providing a highly anticipated two-thirds interim analysis from PRECISION1 in the third quarter and is sharing an early look from our Phase II trial later this year. Now we can open the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Roger Song with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nRoger Song: Great. Thanks for the update and taking our question. Maybe just quickly on the EEC and NET. Curious about the expectation into the initial data readout later this year, particularly the patient numbers and how much efficacy we're going to see versus the safety and et cetera? How meaningful that data update will become? Thank you.\nDave Lennon: Great. Thank you, Roger. So on the EEC and NET trial, remember that these are two-part Phase II studies and the initial Part 1s enroll approximately 10 patients in each trial. We anticipate we'll be able to report out early efficacy data and safety data on those initial Part 1s by the end of this year. Loretta, anything you would add to that?\nLoretta Itri: Only that the recruitment is going well and as anticipated and I don't think we're going to have any problem reaching the ends that have been determined in the Simon's 2-stage design. So, yes, I think we're on target to report our results, as Dave just mentioned.\nDave Lennon: Yes, Roger, we're very encouraged by both of these trials on both because there's been great interest in the community in these combinations and then exploring the potential of nab-sirolimus to improve upon what has been seen before with prior mTOR inhibitors in these -- both of these spaces. So hopefully we'll see that pull through as we report out the first parts of this data. Thanks.\nRoger Song: Yes. Yes, thank you. Yeah, that's very helpful. And in terms of the FYARRO, the sales trajectory, understanding the 1Q seems a little bit kind of off compared to historical average, but any color around the parameters in terms of the first-line use, duration on treatment and maybe some repeat dosing for those existing patients? And maybe also curious as to what's the feedback from the field from your PRECISION results, maybe some impact to the FYARRO sales. Thank you.\nDave Lennon: Yes, sure. So two parts to that in a sense. So let me cover first, on the parameters, we look at in terms of physician adoption, awareness, first-line uses, et cetera, all of those were extremely strong for us as late as we've looked at that data. And so we see no real changes in the community's attitude towards FYARRO and its use in PEComa. We are in a more steady-state situation with incremental sales growth, and we expect some variations quarter-to-quarter to occur. And as I think we indicated a little bit in Q4, we expected Q1 could be a lower quarter for us in this -- in the course of this year. Importantly, we remain -- the adoption remains very robust and it's really a small swing in new patient starts that has impacted FYARRO here. About half of that impact is driven by what we see in demand with new patient starts in some of our largest centers. These also correlate with the largest centers, where we've enrolled a large number of patients in PRECISION1 over the course of the last six to nine months. And recall that we have usually anywhere around 90 patients commercially on drug at any one time. And over the last nine months, we've recruited 80 patients into the PRECISION1 trial. So typically, clinical trials aren't of the same scale and magnitude as a commercial business. But in this case, that is -- we're more aligned in terms of what we're doing in the clinical trial side versus what's happening on the commercial side. Maybe I'll just let Scott talk about the distributor situation and then I would like to go to Loretta to talk a little bit about the physician responses to PRECISION1.\nScott Giacobello: Yes, sure. Thanks, Dave. Yes, on the inventory side, as we noted, we saw some swings in distributed inventory in the quarter, which is -- we're at an unusually low level at the end of Q1 based on what we've seen in recent quarters. And so we do expect that that's going to work itself out over the next few quarters.\nDave Lennon: And then, Loretta, I just want a comment maybe on what we saw from investigators on the PRECISION1 interim results and their response and particularly how that led through the recruitment.\nLoretta Itri: Well, the responses that we saw at the first interim, actually had virtually no impact on our accrual. The community remains very supportive of this study. We didn't miss a beat. And frankly, given the very advanced stage of many of these patients. Remember that the median of prior therapies was 3 to 3.5, with many patients having received more than 5 prior regimens. So to the community that treats these patients, the responses that we saw looked pretty good. And so everyone remains enthusiastic and we have not missed a beat in terms of our accrual. In fact, we had a small uptick. So I don't know if that's what you wanted me to say, Dave, but that's the reality.\nDave Lennon: I always want you to say the reality, Loretta. Thank you. Thanks, Roger. Any other questions?\nRoger Song: No, that's helpful. Thank you. Thank you for taking the question.\nDave Lennon: Thanks. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Joe Catanzaro with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Catanzaro: Hey, everybody. Appreciate you taking my questions. Just have a couple of quick ones. Maybe first following up on the FYARRO sort of commercial dynamic. I guess I'm trying to understand this cannibalization sort of phenomenon that you're describing. It sounds like -- and maybe I'm just misunderstanding it. But it sounds like you're saying enrollment into PRECISION1 pulled away commercial PEComa patients. And I'm trying to understand why that's the case, if that's the case. I think, maybe, I'm just totally misunderstanding it. So any help there, I appreciate it. And I have maybe one or two follow-ups.\nDave Lennon: Yes, sure. So Joe, it's hard for us to tell exactly what patients end up where. What we saw is that the orders coming through -- this is an IV product, and therefore, we don't get physician level data, but we get institutional level data and what we saw was a correlation between reductions in commercial business at some of our largest accounts that often were highly correlated with our PRECISION sites, with some of our largest enrolling PRECISION sites. At a patient level, we don't know exactly how that plays out, but we would anticipate that maybe a few of those patients were spontaneous use like non-PEComa patients, that were being treated commercially and that physicians took the opportunity instead of enrolling those patients in a commercial -- on a commercial basis may have enrolled them into the clinical trial. So it's not PEComa patients into clinical trial because that's obviously an exclusion criteria in this case. And remember that we're talking about swings of 10 patients that create the gap that we saw in Q1 or last 10 patients or less that create the gap that we saw in Q1. And so it takes very few sets of decisions actually to swing the business that way. And so now with Precision fully enrolled, et cetera, the only option for patients that are looking for that last line opportunity in an -- in a non-promoted indication would be to go back to that commercial business.\nJoseph Catanzaro: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just two quick clinical questions. I know you guys have said this would be your expectations, but wondering if you could confirm that within PRECISION1, the sort of baseline features for the full population aligns with the first 40 patients, meaning heavily pretreated, diverse set of tumor types. And then for the G12C decision to terminate that, was that based on any data that had emerged out of that trial? Thanks.\nDave Lennon: Sure. So the -- on the baseline population, we -- from what we can see, it's consistent with what we've seen before. But obviously, we haven't fully evaluated the data to that, and that will only come when we do the interim analysis on the fully cleaned and completed data set. The -- and on the Mirati decision, that decision had nothing to do with efficacy or safety that we saw in that trial. And in fact, we have very little data from that trial so far. And it's more -- it's very much a financial and strategic decision to focus on the endometrial program as well as the NET program, we're really excited about the potential for nab-sirolimus in those indications. Thanks, Joe. Any other questions?\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our –\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Joe. We'll go on to the next question -- next.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tara Bancroft with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nTara Bancroft: Hi. Good morning. So just want to follow up on the last question that Joe asked. So how much difference in cost savings can we expect now over the next year or two now that you're ending this agreement?\nDave Lennon: Sure. Scott, do you want to comment on outlook for spending?\nScott Giacobello: Yes. Tara, thanks for the question. Yes, we haven't shared that information, specific information on the individual program. There will be savings, but we haven't shared that information.\nTara Bancroft: Okay. Thanks.\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Tara. Anything else?\nTara Bancroft: No, I'm good. Thank you very much.\nDave Lennon: Okay. Operator, we can move to any other questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ahu Demir with Ladenburg. Please go ahead.\nAhu Demir: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Two from us. First one, a follow-up to Roger's question. Could you provide more guidance on the EEC program? What are the benchmarks? And what would success look like in this interim analysis for this setting?\nDave Lennon: Super. Thanks for the question, Ahu. Loretta, would you like to comment on that?\nLoretta Itri: Sure. Good morning.\nAhu Demir: Good morning, Loretta.\nLoretta Itri: Hi. How are you, Ahu? So the -- so this is a -- it's a Simon's 2-stage design. And the first cohort is 10 patients, and we're pretty far along in accruing those folks. And the second portion will be an additional 19 patients for a total of 29 patients in the study. It's designed to show on the basis of overall response. We're looking for a response rate that exceeds 20%. And our expectation, of course, is that it may be higher, but that would be -- that would give you the kind of guidance I think you're looking for.\nAhu Demir: That sounds great. Yes, thanks for that, Loretta. My second question is regarding the Mirati collaboration. Based on our scientific understanding, there's a strong rationale between albumin uptake also, therefore, nab-sirolimus uptake in RAS-mutated cancers. So curious, if you will be obtaining the clinical data and do you plan to pursue this setting in the future? Any RAS-mutated cancers and any aspect on that side?\nDave Lennon: I think, Ahu, we'll see how the data comes in on the patients that were enrolled in the trial and make that decision at a later point in time. Right now, we have no plans to expand into that area.\nAhu Demir: Got it. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDave Lennon: Super. Thank you. Operator, any other questions?\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDave Lennon: Great. Thank you. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. Thanks to Scott, Loretta and Audrey for supporting this. And I wanted to remind everyone that we really had great progress over the course of this year, particularly around our clinical study and development programs. We have now fully enrolled our PRECISION1 trial and look forward to our two-thirds interim analysis in quarter three of this year, which will be a major milestone for us and determining where we go next with TSC1 and TSC2 mutant cancers, which are really large opportunity for us to expand the nab-sirolimus portfolio. We're also really excited about the progress we've seen in EEC and NETs enrollment and look forward to early updates on those programs later this year. And then finally, we expect to return to growth for FYARRO in Q2 of 2024 and look forward to sharing updates on that as we progress our commercial business. Otherwise, thank you for joining the call today, and we look forward to further updates as we go through the year. Thanks, everyone. Bye now.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Audrey Gross, Head of Corporate Communications for Aadi Bioscience. Ms. Gross, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Aadi Bioscience conference call to provide an operational update and review results for the first quarter of 2024. On the call is Dr. Dave Lennon, our President and CEO; Scott Giacobello, our CFO; and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Loretta Itri.

We specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that I will turn the call over to Dave for his opening statements. Dave?\nDave Lennon: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2024. At Aadi, we're focused on unlocking the full potential of mTOR inhibition by uniquely combining nab technology in the potent mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus. We believe nab-sirolimus has the potential to deliver deeper inhibition of the mTOR pathway and ultimately better outcomes for people living with cancers that are dependent on that pathway. Today, I'm pleased to announce that a registration-intended PRECISION1 trial is now fully enrolled across a broad array of tumor types. This is an important milestone as we seek to understand the potential of nab-sirolimus for patients with solid tumors harboring either TSC1 or TSC2 inactivating alterations, a sizable market. Our latest internal analysis indicates there are approximately 16,000 patients with these mutations across a variety of tumor types, with mutations roughly evenly split between genes. Each mutation represents a potential multibillion-dollar total addressable market for nab-sirolimus. TSC1 or TSC2-driven cancers are found across a wider range of tumor types, clustering in lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, breast and gynecological locations and are often difficult to treat. We believe PRECISION1 is a cutting-edge trial, testing our innovative therapy, nab-sirolimus in these cancers. Although PRECISION1 is designed as a single trial, each arm is independently evaluated, providing us with the ability to assess one arm separately from the other. Given this design, PRECISION1 can effectively be viewed as two separate studies, each with its own outcome. As a reminder, in Q4, we provided top line results from a planned interim evaluation of the first 40 patients enrolled in PRECISION1. These data demonstrated sustained tumor reductions in a heavily pretreated population based on investigator-assessed responses in the first 40 patients across both arms. Of note, for the TSC1 arm, we reported an investigator-assessed overall response rate of 26%, which was within the range of our expectations. These responses appear to be early, deep and durable, which is especially noteworthy given this heavily pretreated population with a median of three prior lines of therapy. Lastly, these responses were seen across four different tumor types, potentially supporting a tumor-agnostic indication. I want to highlight that ongoing conversations with experts reinforce our view of the clinical significance of the responses we reported from the first interim analysis, especially in the late-line treatment in both patient groups. We continue to believe that should these results hold or improve in larger group of patients, we have a path to submission and potential approval for TSC mutations. With the trial now fully enrolled, we remain on track for our next planned interim readout, which is expected in Q3 of 2024. This highly anticipated analysis will include a total of 80 patients, who have been followed for a minimum of six months and will evaluate the primary endpoint of the study, independently assessed overall response rate as opposed to our December interim analysis, which reported investigator-assessed responses. Looking ahead, we expect the study to be completed by the end of 2024 with full data in 2025. In addition to PRECISION1, the Phase II trials for two promising mTOR-driven cancer targets continue to enroll well. As a reminder on these two trials, the first is evaluating the therapeutic potential of nab-sirolimus in advanced or recurrent endometrioid-type endometrial cancer or EEC in combination with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole. Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract and one of the few cancers with increasing mortality. There is an estimated 10,000 cases of EEC diagnosed annually in the US alone. Prior clinical studies of mTOR inhibitors combined with letrozole have yielded promising results and recent changes in the recommended standard-of-care for early-stage disease creates a potential opportunity for this combination to be used in the first and second-line settings. The second trial is evaluating nab-sirolimus in neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs. NETs are rare with approximately 3,500 cases a year. NETs have a historically low response rate to the treatment with oral rapalogs or other agents, which nonetheless are used clinically and recommended in treatment guidelines. In preclinical animal models, nab-sirolimus demonstrated improved target suppression relative to other mTORs, warranting further exploration of nab-sirolimus in the clinical setting for NETs. We're excited about this trial because it provides the opportunity to demonstrate what we believe is nab-sirolimus' best-in-class efficacy in a known mTOR-sensitive tumor type. Overactivation and dysregulation of the mTOR pathway is commonly found in various tumors and the unique delivery and excellent safety profile of nab-sirolimus provides the opportunity to combat these difficult to treat cancers. As such, we think these are promising indications and are eager to present initial data from these open label studies later this year. As a final update to our development plans, today, we announced that we have terminated our collaboration and supply agreement with Mirati, now BMS. That was evaluating the combination of its adagrasib, a KRAS selective inhibitor, and nab-sirolimus in KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. At our request, we mutually agreed with BMS to discontinue this early phase trial, which enables us to prioritize the evaluation of nab-sirolimus in our ongoing Phase II trials for the promising indications of EEC and NETs. Turning now to FYARRO. FYARRO continues to perform well with net product sales for the quarter of $5.4 million. For a bit of context, this is a decrease from prior year and reflects Q1 changes in distributor ordering patterns and fewer new commercial patient initiations in Q1 than historical average. Swings in what is actually a very small number of patients may be due in part to cannibalization at top accounts, where we're seeing robust enrollment into our current clinical trials. We believe this will correct itself in subsequent quarters and we expect a return to sales growth in Q2. FYARRO has cemented its position as the preferred treatment for malignant PEComa after just two years on the market. We have high penetration across academic and community settings and have seen the consistent addition of new accounts ordering FYARRO every quarter now with more than 200 accounts ordering since launch. We are proud of the impact FYARRO has had and will continue to have for patients with this rare and aggressive cancer. With sustained commercial success of FYARRO, cash runway into Q4 2025 and a catalyst heavy 12 months ahead of us, we are well positioned to realize our ambition of becoming a multi-indication precision oncology company. I will now turn the call over to Scott for updates on our financial progress. Scott?\nScott Giacobello: Thanks, Dave. We ended the first quarter 2024 with $88.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Responsible capital management, including measures implemented in early 2024 to streamline our operations and reduce costs, continue to support a healthy balance sheet that will fund operations into Q4 2025 based on current plans. FYARRO net product sales were $5.4 million for the first quarter, representing an 8.8% decrease from the prior year period. As Dave mentioned, this decrease was due in part to distributor ordering patterns in Q1, which we expect will correct in future quarters as well as lower commercial patient initiations.

So the -- on the baseline population, we -- from what we can see, it's consistent with what we've seen before. But obviously, we haven't fully evaluated the data to that, and that will only come when we do the interim analysis on the fully cleaned and completed data set. The -- and on the Mirati decision, that decision had nothing to do with efficacy or safety that we saw in that trial. And in fact, we have very little data from that trial so far. And it's more -- it's very much a financial and strategic decision to focus on the endometrial program as well as the NET program, we're really excited about the potential for nab-sirolimus in those indications. Thanks, Joe. Any other questions?\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our –\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Joe. We'll go on to the next question -- next.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tara Bancroft with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nTara Bancroft: Hi. Good morning. So just want to follow up on the last question that Joe asked. So how much difference in cost savings can we expect now over the next year or two now that you're ending this agreement?\nDave Lennon: Sure. Scott, do you want to comment on outlook for spending?\nScott Giacobello: Yes. Tara, thanks for the question. Yes, we haven't shared that information, specific information on the individual program. There will be savings, but we haven't shared that information.\nTara Bancroft: Okay. Thanks.\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Tara. Anything else?\nTara Bancroft: No, I'm good. Thank you very much.\nDave Lennon: Okay. Operator, we can move to any other questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ahu Demir with Ladenburg. Please go ahead.\nAhu Demir: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Two from us. First one, a follow-up to Roger's question. Could you provide more guidance on the EEC program? What are the benchmarks? And what would success look like in this interim analysis for this setting?\nDave Lennon: Super. Thanks for the question, Ahu. Loretta, would you like to comment on that?\nLoretta Itri: Sure. Good morning.\nAhu Demir: Good morning, Loretta.\nLoretta Itri: Hi. How are you, Ahu? So the -- so this is a -- it's a Simon's 2-stage design. And the first cohort is 10 patients, and we're pretty far along in accruing those folks. And the second portion will be an additional 19 patients for a total of 29 patients in the study. It's designed to show on the basis of overall response. We're looking for a response rate that exceeds 20%. And our expectation, of course, is that it may be higher, but that would be -- that would give you the kind of guidance I think you're looking for.\nAhu Demir: That sounds great. Yes, thanks for that, Loretta. My second question is regarding the Mirati collaboration. Based on our scientific understanding, there's a strong rationale between albumin uptake also, therefore, nab-sirolimus uptake in RAS-mutated cancers. So curious, if you will be obtaining the clinical data and do you plan to pursue this setting in the future? Any RAS-mutated cancers and any aspect on that side?\nDave Lennon: I think, Ahu, we'll see how the data comes in on the patients that were enrolled in the trial and make that decision at a later point in time. Right now, we have no plans to expand into that area.\nAhu Demir: Got it. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDave Lennon: Super. Thank you. Operator, any other questions?\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDave Lennon: Great. Thank you. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. Thanks to Scott, Loretta and Audrey for supporting this. And I wanted to remind everyone that we really had great progress over the course of this year, particularly around our clinical study and development programs. We have now fully enrolled our PRECISION1 trial and look forward to our two-thirds interim analysis in quarter three of this year, which will be a major milestone for us and determining where we go next with TSC1 and TSC2 mutant cancers, which are really large opportunity for us to expand the nab-sirolimus portfolio. We're also really excited about the progress we've seen in EEC and NETs enrollment and look forward to early updates on those programs later this year. And then finally, we expect to return to growth for FYARRO in Q2 of 2024 and look forward to sharing updates on that as we progress our commercial business. Otherwise, thank you for joining the call today, and we look forward to further updates as we go through the year. Thanks, everyone. Bye now.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, more participants are in a listen-only-mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Audrey Gross [ph] Head of Corporate Communications for Aadi Bioscience. Ms. Gross, please go ahead.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Aadi Bioscience conference call to provide an operational update and review results of the fourth quarter and full year 2023. On the call is Dr. Dave Lennon, our President and CEO; Scott Giacobello, our CFO; and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Loretta Itri. Today, we will provide an overview of operational activity and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. We will open the line for questions at the end of the call following closing comments. A quick reminder that statements made on the call today will include forward-looking statements. Actual events or results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements as a result of various risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of our annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be found at www.sec.gov or on our website at www.aadibio.com. In addition, any forward-looking statements made on this call represent our views only as of today, March 13, 2024, and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave for his opening statements. Dave?\nDave Lennon: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review our financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. At Aadi, we are focused on unlocking the full potential of mTOR inhibition by uniquely combining nab technology and the potent mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus. We believe nab-sirolimus has potential to deliver deeper inhibition and ultimately better outcomes for patients living with cancers that are dependent on the mTOR pathway. In 2023 was a year marked by progress and increasing momentum for the company as we delivered strong execution against both commercial and development goals. First, FYARRO sales remained solid, achieving a cumulative $24.4 million for the full year of 2023, representing a 60% growth over prior year. FYARRO achieved high penetration in the academic and community settings and is considered the preferred treatment for malignant PEComa. Clinically, a key focus for our organization has been realizing the potential of nab-sirolimus for patients with solid tumors harboring either TSC1 or TSC2 inactivating alterations. These type of genetic alterations are thought to activate the mTOR pathway leading to uncontrolled cell growth and our PRECISION 1 trial is an interventional study designed to elucidate the potential of nab-sirolimus to treat all types of solid tumors with either of these alterations. As a reminder, the unmet need in TSC1 and TAC2 mutated cancers is sizable, whether considering together or independently and represents about 2% of all solid tumor cancer patients. Our latest internal analysis indicates there are approximately 16,000 new patients with these new mutations across a variety of tumor types each year in the U.S. alone. With mutations roughly evenly split between genes, each mutation represents a potential multibillion-dollar addressable market for nab-sirolimus. TSC1 or TSC2-driven cancers are found across a wide range of tumor types, clustering in lung, gastrointestinal, general urinary, breast and gynecological locations and are often very difficult to treat. We believe PRECISION 1 is a cutting-edge trial testing our innovative therapy nab-sirolimus in these cancer types. Although PRECISION 1 is designed as a single trial, each arm is independently evaluated providing us with the ability to assess one arm separately from the other. Given this design, PRECISION 1 can effectively be viewed as two separate studies, each with its own outcome. In Q4, we provided top line results from a planned interim evaluation of the first 40 patients enrolled in PRECISION 1. These data demonstrated sustained tumor reductions in a heavily pretreated population based on investigator-assessed responses in the first 40 patients across both arms. As a reminder, for the TSC 1 arm, 19 efficacy evaluable patients were included in the cutoff date for the interim analysis who had at least one post baseline scan. We reported an overall response rate of 26%, which was within the range of our expectations. Importantly, responses appear to be early, deep and durable. Time to response was 1.4 months and all responses were ongoing at the time of data cutoff. This is especially noteworthy given that this is a heavily pretreated population with a median of three prior lines of therapy. Lastly, these responses were seen across four different tumor types supporting a tumor-agnostic indication. In the TSC 2 arm, we reported a lower response rate, but given these patients were heavily pretreated, including 50% who had had at least five prior lines of therapy, these early TSC 2 results are challenging to interpret. PRECISION 1 continues to enroll steadily, and we now expect the trial to be fully enrolled by May. We are still on track for our next plan interim readout, which is expected in Q3 of 2024. This readout will include a total of 80 patients who have been followed for a minimum of 6 months and will evaluate the primary input in the study, independently assessed overall response rate as opposed to our December analysis, which reported investigator-assessed responses. We expect the study to be completed by the end of 2024 with full data in early 2025. In addition to PRECISION 1, enrollment is underway for both of the previously announced Phase II single indication trials for two promising mTOR driven cancer targets. Overactivation and dysregulation of the mTOR pathway is commonly found in various tumors, and unique delivery and excellent safety profile of nab-sirolimus provides the opportunity to combat these difficult-to-treat cancers. The first trial is evaluating nab-sirolimus in neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs, NETs are with approximately 3,500 patients per year. NETs have historically had a low response rate to treatment with oral rapalogs and other agents, which nonetheless are used clinically and recommended in treatment guidelines today. In preclinical animal models, nab-sirolimus demonstrated improved target suppression relative to other mTORs warranting further exploration of nab-sirolimus in this indication. We're excited about this trial because it provides the opportunity to demonstrate what we believe is nab-sirolimus' best-in-class efficacy in a known mTOR-sensitive tumor type. The second trial we started last year is evaluating the therapeutic potential of nab-sirolimus in advanced and recurrent endometrial type endometrial cancer in combination with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole. Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract and one of the few cancers with increasing mortality. There's an estimated 10,000 cases of EEC diagnosed annually in the U.S. alone. Prior clinical studies of the mTOR inhibitors, combined with letrozole have yielded promising results and recent changes in the recommended standard of care for early-stage disease creates a potential opportunity for our combination to be used in these first and second-line settings. Both of these open-label studies are actively enrolling, and we plan to present initial data later this year. Rounding out our clinical development program, we also have an ongoing trial with combination of Mirati's KRAS inhibitor in lung cancer and other solid tumors. With a solid commercial foundation provided by FYARRO [ph] a robust and bold clinical development program spanning genetically-driven tumors in other mTOR-sensitive tumors and a cash runway into Q4 2025, we are well positioned to realize our ambition of becoming a multi-indication precision oncology company. I will now turn the call over to Scott for updates on our financial progress. Scott?\nScott Giacobello: Thanks, Dave. We had a solid fourth quarter and ended 2023 with $108.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In early 2024, we implemented measures to streamline our operations and reduce costs, which included headcount reductions in our customer-facing operations and corporate functions. Following these measures, we anticipate that our balance sheet will fund operations into Q4 2025 based on current plans. FYARRO net product sales were $6.3 million for the fourth quarter, representing 6% growth over Q3 2023 and 21% over the prior year quarter. Full year 6.3sales were $24.4 million, an increase of 60% over prior year sales of $15.2 million. Research and development expenses for the quarter increased to $12.8 million compared to $9.4 million in the prior year quarter. For the year, R&D expense amounted to $48.9 million compared to $32.7 million last year. This increase is primarily related to the continued progress of the ongoing PRECISION 1 trial and initiation of the programs in endometrial cancer and NETs. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $10.3 million compared to $11.1 million in the same period in 2022. For the year, SG&A expenses totaled $44.5 million compared to $40.2 million in the prior year. This increase is due primarily to higher legal and company infrastructure costs and increased marketing expenses related to FYARRO. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $16.3 million compared to $13.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss for the year was $65.8 million compared to $60.5 million in the prior year. For more information on our financial performance for 2023, a detailed discussion of the results reported on this call will be provided in our 10-K to be filed later today. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?\nDave Lennon: Thank you, Scott. I'm so proud of the progress we made in Q4 and what the team accomplished in 2023. FYARRO remains a valuable asset with sustained demand to help meet the needs of patients with PEComa. We're making tremendous progress against our clinical development plans with two sizable markets in TSC1 and TSC2 in activating alterations as well as other mTOR-driven cancers. We're looking forward to sharing the two-thirds interim analysis from PRECISION 1 in the third quarter with full enrollment inspected in May and study completion by the end of 2024. We can now open the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Joe Catanzaro with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJoe Catanzaro: Yeah, thanks. Appreciate you taking the questions here. Maybe first one, I know the first 40 patients were characterized as being very heavily pretreated. So wondering if you have any visibility or updates around what the remainder of the trials look like? And maybe along these lines, whether you've seen any change in enrollment dynamics in any way since the interim data disclosure? Thanks. And I have one follow-up.\nDave Lennon: Great. Joe, thank you for the question. I always appreciate talking more about PRECISION 1. Yes. So the first 40 patients were heavily pretreated. We saw three or more lines of prior therapy as those patients enrolled in that first 40 group. We anticipate, right, by the trial design that this is -- we're going to get a number of late-line patients. Patients have to have satisfied the criteria for the indication that they enroll in, in terms of being -- having received all appropriate standard of care prior to their entry and treatment with nab-sirolimus in our trial. And so we anticipate continuing to enroll later line patients within the trial. I wouldn't comment on the overall nature of what we're going to end up with. We're still enrolling patients in the trial, and we'll obviously report out the next or the total 80 patients at the two-thirds interim later this year.\nJoe Catanzaro: Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up, maybe unrelated to PRECISION 1. Wondering if there are any early expectations around when you could report initial data from the endometrial or NET studies? I appreciate those are still in the early days. And then any updates on the adagrasib combo trial. Wondering maybe if there's been any changes there with the adagrasib acquisition by Bristol? Thanks.\nDave Lennon: Yes. So great questions. I think I mentioned earlier that we do anticipate potentially sharing data on endometrial or neuroendocrine trial later this year. Those are open-label single-arm Phase II studies, and we have the opportunity to enroll those. We'll share the data when we think it's appropriate and we have something meaningful to say about how that data is -- those patients are enrolling and that data is maturing. I'm happy to say that both studies are actively enrolling patients, and there's good engagement with the community on generating patients for each of those trials, which we just think is initially a great sign in terms of folks' interest in these therapeutic regimens in each of those indications. And then on the Mirati BMS collaboration that continues and is ongoing. We are enrolling patients into that trial, and we don't have any further updates at this point.\nJoe Catanzaro: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And thanks for taking my questions.\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Liang Cheng with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nLiang Cheng: Sure. Thank you. This - today I'm for Roger. So thank you for taking our questions. I guess from us, we have two questions. One is around FYARRO. So guess more [ph] FYARRO in the coming year. Can you provide us any details, guidance or commercial plans? Second question is about, I know you guys been interacting with FDA about the tumor agnostic. So what's in your understanding, what's the most important thing for FDA to consider label as a tumor agnostic? Thank you.\nDave Lennon: Great. Thank you, Liang, and thanks for stepping in for Roger. So maybe in terms of FYARRO outlook, maybe I'll turn it over to Scott to talk a little bit about that, and then we'll talk about your second question a little more. But Scott, do you want to just comment on FYARRO outlook for the coming year?\nScott Giacobello: Sure, absolutely. Yes, thanks for the question, Liang. Yes, I think for FYARRO, I mean, as you see, I mean, we're not going to provide guidance for this year. I think what you've seen over the last few quarters, the sales stabilizing around the $6 million mark or slightly above. And I think so the expectation there is we continue to be excited about FYARRO and the potential to grow there. But I think that over the last few quarters, you've seen the sales stabilizing in that $6 million to $6.5 million range, and I think that's what we would expect for 2024.\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Scott. It is -- Liang, it is a very -- team has done a great job penetrating the market here. We're available and preferred for PEComa in the first-line setting and widely recognized as the preferred therapy for PEComa. It is just an ultra rare population. And ultimately, we may be reaching saturation in that market and expect more incremental growth from here on out. And then your second question was on what are the most important considerations when we think about the FDA's view on the tumor agnostic indication. I'm going to turn it over to Loretta to give her thoughts on how we think or how we interpret the FDA's guidance around the tumor agnostic indication and what's most important there. So Loretta, do you want to comment?\nLoretta Itri: Sure. I'd be happy to. I think from what we have seen recently, perhaps the most important thing that the agency wants to see in tumor agnostic studies is a variety of different tumor types. What they do not want in a tumor agnostic study is to see concentrations of information in certain subtypes of patients. They are looking for a representation of the mutation across a variety of different tumor types. That is why you do a tumor agnostic study. So I think that, that is perhaps the single most important element in terms of their determination regarding whether or not a drug classifies for tumor agnostic approval. And then, of course, I think they are looking for a reasonable response rate and, of course, a good safety profile. In our case, since we already have approval in a single indication, I think they would be looking to see that the safety profile in the agnostic population closely resembles what we have already seen in PEComa.\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Loretta. And just to add on to what Loretta was saying, what we saw so far, we have enrolled a very diverse tumor population within our trial, and I think you saw that even in the early results where we had a kind of broad distribution of tumor types that we shared back in December. Thanks, Liang, for the questions. And I think if there's no follow-ups, we can move to the next.\nLiang Cheng: Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nDave Lennon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question coming from the line of Ahu Demir with Ladenburg. Your line is open.\nAhu Demir: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I have two questions, a follow-up to Joe's question regarding endometrial cancer. One, could you give us a sense of the sites open, how many sites are open and inclusion and exclusion criteria for the patients? And what are we expecting to see this year? How many patients are they heavily pretreated? If you can provide a little bit of color, that would be great.\nDave Lennon: Sure. I think -- so Ahu, we're happy to answer those questions. I'm going to turn it over to Loretta for some of the details. But at the same time, we probably wouldn't discuss a number of sites or number of patients at this point just given where we are in the trial, and it is active, and we're kind of continuing to build that story. But maybe just in the design of the trial and what we might expect to see later this year, I'll let Loretta give you an update there. So, Loretta?\nLoretta Itri: Good morning, Ahu. Always great questions, as usual, coming from you. So basically, this is an open-label Phase II study, looking to evaluate the combination of nab-sirolimus with letrozole in patients who have advanced and that would be advanced or unresectable Stage 3 or 4 or recurrent endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. Patients will have received either no or one prior line of chemotherapy. So this is a population of patients who are relatively early in their treatment course, which is somewhat differentiated, of course, from what we're doing in PRECISION. So patients are treated with the same dose of nab-sirolimus as they were in PEComa that is a well-established and safe dose. And I think pretty much that this is a Simon 2-stage study, so we plan to enroll the first cohort, and we anticipate since this is an open label study being able to report out early results by the end of this year. Does that address your question, Ahu, would you like more detail?\nAhu Demir: This is great. Thank you so much Loretta. This is very helpful. And thank you for your compliment as well. I have one more conceptual question for you, Loretta, if I may. So you mentioned mTOR sensitive tumors besides TSC1, 2, could you comment on what other mutational backgrounds are sensitive to mTOR inhibitors?\nLoretta Itri: Well, I think that's quite a difficult question because I think there are many mutations along the mTOR pathway that may provide -- that may provide targets. However, I don't think that any of those specifically has been identified as a specific mutational target for mTOR inhibition. There are suggestions that I don't think is any of those are proven.\nAhu Demir: Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nLoretta Itri: You're most welcome.\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Ahu. Operator, are there any other questions?\nOperator: And I see no further questions in the queue at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Dr. Dave Lennon for any closing remarks.\nDave Lennon: Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I think as you see, we are delivering on the operational goals we have set for both 2023 and looking ahead into 2024, we're very confident on our ability to deliver against our number one priority, which is the PRECISION 1 trial. And we look forward to providing an update on that two-thirds interim later this year and finishing that trial within 2024. We're also excited about the new programs we mentioned today and got to discuss a little bit in the Q&A and look forward to providing updates on both our NET and endometrial trials later this year. At the same time, we remain really confident in the continued progress we're making in the PEComa market with FYARRO. This is an ultra-orphan indication, and we're highly penetrated within that market. And that continues to deliver solid sales for us as we go forward. Overall, otherwise, I thank you all for your time and attention today, and we look forward to the next update with you all. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

There's an estimated 10,000 cases of EEC diagnosed annually in the U.S. alone. Prior clinical studies of the mTOR inhibitors, combined with letrozole have yielded promising results and recent changes in the recommended standard of care for early-stage disease creates a potential opportunity for our combination to be used in these first and second-line settings. Both of these open-label studies are actively enrolling, and we plan to present initial data later this year. Rounding out our clinical development program, we also have an ongoing trial with combination of Mirati's KRAS inhibitor in lung cancer and other solid tumors. With a solid commercial foundation provided by FYARRO [ph] a robust and bold clinical development program spanning genetically-driven tumors in other mTOR-sensitive tumors and a cash runway into Q4 2025, we are well positioned to realize our ambition of becoming a multi-indication precision oncology company. I will now turn the call over to Scott for updates on our financial progress. Scott?\nScott Giacobello: Thanks, Dave. We had a solid fourth quarter and ended 2023 with $108.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In early 2024, we implemented measures to streamline our operations and reduce costs, which included headcount reductions in our customer-facing operations and corporate functions. Following these measures, we anticipate that our balance sheet will fund operations into Q4 2025 based on current plans. FYARRO net product sales were $6.3 million for the fourth quarter, representing 6% growth over Q3 2023 and 21% over the prior year quarter. Full year 6.3sales were $24.4 million, an increase of 60% over prior year sales of $15.2 million. Research and development expenses for the quarter increased to $12.8 million compared to $9.4 million in the prior year quarter. For the year, R&D expense amounted to $48.9 million compared to $32.7 million last year. This increase is primarily related to the continued progress of the ongoing PRECISION 1 trial and initiation of the programs in endometrial cancer and NETs. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $10.3 million compared to $11.1 million in the same period in 2022. For the year, SG&A expenses totaled $44.5 million compared to $40.2 million in the prior year. This increase is due primarily to higher legal and company infrastructure costs and increased marketing expenses related to FYARRO. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $16.3 million compared to $13.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss for the year was $65.8 million compared to $60.5 million in the prior year. For more information on our financial performance for 2023, a detailed discussion of the results reported on this call will be provided in our 10-K to be filed later today. I'll now hand the call back to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?\nDave Lennon: Thank you, Scott. I'm so proud of the progress we made in Q4 and what the team accomplished in 2023. FYARRO remains a valuable asset with sustained demand to help meet the needs of patients with PEComa. We're making tremendous progress against our clinical development plans with two sizable markets in TSC1 and TSC2 in activating alterations as well as other mTOR-driven cancers. We're looking forward to sharing the two-thirds interim analysis from PRECISION 1 in the third quarter with full enrollment inspected in May and study completion by the end of 2024. We can now open the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Joe Catanzaro with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJoe Catanzaro: Yeah, thanks. Appreciate you taking the questions here. Maybe first one, I know the first 40 patients were characterized as being very heavily pretreated. So wondering if you have any visibility or updates around what the remainder of the trials look like? And maybe along these lines, whether you've seen any change in enrollment dynamics in any way since the interim data disclosure? Thanks. And I have one follow-up.\nDave Lennon: Great. Joe, thank you for the question. I always appreciate talking more about PRECISION 1. Yes. So the first 40 patients were heavily pretreated. We saw three or more lines of prior therapy as those patients enrolled in that first 40 group. We anticipate, right, by the trial design that this is -- we're going to get a number of late-line patients. Patients have to have satisfied the criteria for the indication that they enroll in, in terms of being -- having received all appropriate standard of care prior to their entry and treatment with nab-sirolimus in our trial. And so we anticipate continuing to enroll later line patients within the trial. I wouldn't comment on the overall nature of what we're going to end up with. We're still enrolling patients in the trial, and we'll obviously report out the next or the total 80 patients at the two-thirds interim later this year.\nJoe Catanzaro: Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up, maybe unrelated to PRECISION 1. Wondering if there are any early expectations around when you could report initial data from the endometrial or NET studies? I appreciate those are still in the early days. And then any updates on the adagrasib combo trial. Wondering maybe if there's been any changes there with the adagrasib acquisition by Bristol? Thanks.\nDave Lennon: Yes. So great questions. I think I mentioned earlier that we do anticipate potentially sharing data on endometrial or neuroendocrine trial later this year. Those are open-label single-arm Phase II studies, and we have the opportunity to enroll those. We'll share the data when we think it's appropriate and we have something meaningful to say about how that data is -- those patients are enrolling and that data is maturing. I'm happy to say that both studies are actively enrolling patients, and there's good engagement with the community on generating patients for each of those trials, which we just think is initially a great sign in terms of folks' interest in these therapeutic regimens in each of those indications. And then on the Mirati BMS collaboration that continues and is ongoing. We are enrolling patients into that trial, and we don't have any further updates at this point.\nJoe Catanzaro: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And thanks for taking my questions.\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Liang Cheng with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nLiang Cheng: Sure. Thank you. This - today I'm for Roger. So thank you for taking our questions. I guess from us, we have two questions. One is around FYARRO. So guess more [ph] FYARRO in the coming year. Can you provide us any details, guidance or commercial plans? Second question is about, I know you guys been interacting with FDA about the tumor agnostic. So what's in your understanding, what's the most important thing for FDA to consider label as a tumor agnostic? Thank you.\nDave Lennon: Great. Thank you, Liang, and thanks for stepping in for Roger. So maybe in terms of FYARRO outlook, maybe I'll turn it over to Scott to talk a little bit about that, and then we'll talk about your second question a little more. But Scott, do you want to just comment on FYARRO outlook for the coming year?\nScott Giacobello: Sure, absolutely. Yes, thanks for the question, Liang. Yes, I think for FYARRO, I mean, as you see, I mean, we're not going to provide guidance for this year. I think what you've seen over the last few quarters, the sales stabilizing around the $6 million mark or slightly above. And I think so the expectation there is we continue to be excited about FYARRO and the potential to grow there. But I think that over the last few quarters, you've seen the sales stabilizing in that $6 million to $6.5 million range, and I think that's what we would expect for 2024.\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Scott. It is -- Liang, it is a very -- team has done a great job penetrating the market here. We're available and preferred for PEComa in the first-line setting and widely recognized as the preferred therapy for PEComa. It is just an ultra rare population. And ultimately, we may be reaching saturation in that market and expect more incremental growth from here on out. And then your second question was on what are the most important considerations when we think about the FDA's view on the tumor agnostic indication. I'm going to turn it over to Loretta to give her thoughts on how we think or how we interpret the FDA's guidance around the tumor agnostic indication and what's most important there. So Loretta, do you want to comment?\nLoretta Itri: Sure. I'd be happy to. I think from what we have seen recently, perhaps the most important thing that the agency wants to see in tumor agnostic studies is a variety of different tumor types. What they do not want in a tumor agnostic study is to see concentrations of information in certain subtypes of patients. They are looking for a representation of the mutation across a variety of different tumor types. That is why you do a tumor agnostic study. So I think that, that is perhaps the single most important element in terms of their determination regarding whether or not a drug classifies for tumor agnostic approval. And then, of course, I think they are looking for a reasonable response rate and, of course, a good safety profile. In our case, since we already have approval in a single indication, I think they would be looking to see that the safety profile in the agnostic population closely resembles what we have already seen in PEComa.\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Loretta. And just to add on to what Loretta was saying, what we saw so far, we have enrolled a very diverse tumor population within our trial, and I think you saw that even in the early results where we had a kind of broad distribution of tumor types that we shared back in December. Thanks, Liang, for the questions. And I think if there's no follow-ups, we can move to the next.\nLiang Cheng: Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nDave Lennon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question coming from the line of Ahu Demir with Ladenburg. Your line is open.\nAhu Demir: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I have two questions, a follow-up to Joe's question regarding endometrial cancer. One, could you give us a sense of the sites open, how many sites are open and inclusion and exclusion criteria for the patients? And what are we expecting to see this year? How many patients are they heavily pretreated? If you can provide a little bit of color, that would be great.\nDave Lennon: Sure. I think -- so Ahu, we're happy to answer those questions. I'm going to turn it over to Loretta for some of the details. But at the same time, we probably wouldn't discuss a number of sites or number of patients at this point just given where we are in the trial, and it is active, and we're kind of continuing to build that story. But maybe just in the design of the trial and what we might expect to see later this year, I'll let Loretta give you an update there. So, Loretta?\nLoretta Itri: Good morning, Ahu. Always great questions, as usual, coming from you. So basically, this is an open-label Phase II study, looking to evaluate the combination of nab-sirolimus with letrozole in patients who have advanced and that would be advanced or unresectable Stage 3 or 4 or recurrent endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. Patients will have received either no or one prior line of chemotherapy. So this is a population of patients who are relatively early in their treatment course, which is somewhat differentiated, of course, from what we're doing in PRECISION. So patients are treated with the same dose of nab-sirolimus as they were in PEComa that is a well-established and safe dose. And I think pretty much that this is a Simon 2-stage study, so we plan to enroll the first cohort, and we anticipate since this is an open label study being able to report out early results by the end of this year. Does that address your question, Ahu, would you like more detail?\nAhu Demir: This is great. Thank you so much Loretta. This is very helpful. And thank you for your compliment as well. I have one more conceptual question for you, Loretta, if I may. So you mentioned mTOR sensitive tumors besides TSC1, 2, could you comment on what other mutational backgrounds are sensitive to mTOR inhibitors?\nLoretta Itri: Well, I think that's quite a difficult question because I think there are many mutations along the mTOR pathway that may provide -- that may provide targets. However, I don't think that any of those specifically has been identified as a specific mutational target for mTOR inhibition. There are suggestions that I don't think is any of those are proven.\nAhu Demir: Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nLoretta Itri: You're most welcome.\nDave Lennon: Thanks, Ahu. Operator, are there any other questions?\nOperator: And I see no further questions in the queue at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Dr. Dave Lennon for any closing remarks.\nDave Lennon: Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I think as you see, we are delivering on the operational goals we have set for both 2023 and looking ahead into 2024, we're very confident on our ability to deliver against our number one priority, which is the PRECISION 1 trial. And we look forward to providing an update on that two-thirds interim later this year and finishing that trial within 2024. We're also excited about the new programs we mentioned today and got to discuss a little bit in the Q&A and look forward to providing updates on both our NET and endometrial trials later this year. At the same time, we remain really confident in the continued progress we're making in the PEComa market with FYARRO. This is an ultra-orphan indication, and we're highly penetrated within that market. And that continues to deliver solid sales for us as we go forward. Overall, otherwise, I thank you all for your time and attention today, and we look forward to the next update with you all. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "fullTranscript": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Airtel Africa Nine Month 2025 Results Update. All participants will be in listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity to ask questions later during the conference. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sunil Taldar. Please go ahead, sir.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you. Good evening. Good morning to everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm joined on the line by our CFO, Jaideep Paul; and Kamal Dua, our Deputy CFO, who as you will have seen from our previous announcements, will be taking over from Jaideep as CFO later this year. Alastair Jones, our Head of Investor Relations, also joins us on the call. We will shortly be answering your questions, but first I would like to provide you with a brief overview of our performance over the last nine months and in particular over the last quarter. Over the last few years there has been continued volatility in the macro environment, but more recently we've seen some signs of stabilization, which is encouraging. However, throughout the volatility, demand for our services has been sustained, which really reflects the strong underlying demand across our markets. The ability to provide these critical services despite the tough macroeconomic environment is testament to our focused strategy and resilient business model. The strategy we have adopted has continued to serve increased digital and financial inclusion, smartphone penetration has increased over 5 percentage points over the year, and the 18% growth in our mobile money customer base to over 44 million reflects our focus on providing a wide range of financial services to individuals and businesses that have been previously excluded from the financial ecosystem. These initiatives have translated into strong constant currency results with an acceleration in revenue growth over the last few quarters. Revenues in the quarter reached $1.27 billion, which was a 21.3% growth in constant currency, accelerating from 20.8% growth in quarter two and 19% in quarter one. Given the foreign exchange headwinds experienced over the last year, reported currency revenues grew 2.5% in quarter three. Before discussing our performance across our two main reporting segments, I wanted to highlight our performance on regional basis in the last quarter, including both mobile services and mobile money. In Nigeria, we continue to see encouraging trends with constant currency growth of almost 35%. In East Africa, revenue growth accelerated to almost 23% in constant currency and in Francophone growth returned to double digit levels at 10.2 percentage, which is an encouraging performance given the acceleration from 5.2% we reported in quarter one. [Technical Difficulty] combined with the real opportunities. This opportunity is further enhanced by the ability to drive increased financial inclusion through our mobile money business to promote economic prosperity across our markets. However, I have also talked in the past about the substantial growth available in other areas and we remain excited about the opportunity in the enterprise space, data centers and also the home broadband offering. Secondly, our relentless focus will ensure that the flow through of the revenues will continue to drive profitable growth despite the macroeconomic environment we will continue to focus on EBITDA margin improvements as a result of these efficiencies. Thirdly, as refresh strategy puts a greater customer experience at the center of everything we do. In order to do this, we continue to invest in our network and improve as well as simplify the customer journeys. Our derisk balance sheet and strong capital structure enables us to execute on these priorities. Importantly, in order to ensure sustained value creation for all stakeholders and to be able to achieve these strategic objectives, the business must be underpinned by a strong risk management framework. Our robust corporate governance strategy is aimed at mitigating risks that we are exposed to. I'm happy to say that our track record speaks for itself. We will maintain this rigorous approach to create value for all stakeholders. And finally, before handing it over to the Q&A, I thought it worthwhile highlighting the recent developments in Nigeria where the NCC has granted approvals for tariff adjustments. We are very grateful to the relevant authorities for these approvals, which we believe is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the industry and enable us to continue providing reliable and affordable services to our customers. We are aware of the inflationary pressures consumers in Nigeria are facing, but see this development as key to maintaining our infrastructure investment to provide a value for money proposition that prioritizes customer experience. And with that I would like to now open the line for questions for which I'm joined by Jaideep. Operator, I now hand over to you to facilitate the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] The first question that we have comes from Rohit Modi of Citibank. Please go ahead.\nRohit Modi: Hi. Congratulations on good set of result and thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. A couple of them for me. Firstly, on price increase situation in Nigeria if you can give more color around, now that you've got approval, what kind of price increase do you expect? I believe we've got 50% – maximum 50% approval, but not sure if that's – that's – that's kind of price increase you're looking for in the market. And secondly, if you can I understand that it's too early but it can give any ballpark or any sense around what kind of margin improvement that you can see, with any percentage of price increase that you see. My question is around if you see 10% price increase, what kind of margin flow that flows into the margin going forward? Lastly, on Francophone we have seen a bit of erosion in margins in Francophone as well, apart from Nigeria. Are there any specific countries that you're seeing – where you're seeing most more margin erosion in that region? That would be great. Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Sure, thanks Rohit. So let me take the first question on Nigeria price increase. See, firstly, we are grateful to the Nigerian authorities for the approvals we received, which we see as very supportive for the entire industry and support continued investment into digital infrastructure across Nigeria. With regards to the impact of these tariff adjustments on our business, the approvals are clearly a very positive development and combined with recent signs of macro stability, we expect a positive outcome to our business following these developments. However, see there is a little bit of an uncertainty around the competitive action around these tariff increases and the elasticity of demand in the method whereby these tariff increases can be implemented. As a result of some of these questions which remain slightly unanswered at this point in time, it is very early for us to conclude on the real impact that this tariff increase will have on our business. We expect to initiate these adjustments in early February, once we hear back from the authorities and these actions have had time to play out. We will have more visibility on the potential impact which is when we will be able to provide better context to the market on the impact of price increase on the overall growth and therefore on the margin improvement. On the margin side, as we said that it's a very positive development, the additional revenue we expect will not come with material cost increase and therefore we should see – we are able to see an uplift in revenue trends as supportive for the EBITDA margin progression. That's how we see this entire pricing play out with respect to impact on our overall revenue growth and also margin progression. With respect to Francophone, which is the third question that you asked, we've seen growth accelerate in Francophone from circa 5% growth that we reported in francophone in quarter one to a double digit growth that we're reporting in this quarter of 10.2 percentage points. So growth has done well. The margin progression from – on quarter-to-quarter, from last quarter to this quarter we're seeing slight dip which is primarily due to the higher marketing spends that we have had to drive our growth and sweat our assets in Francophone. That's the only thing. Other than that there is nothing else.\nRohit Modi: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from John Karidis of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Thank you.\nJohn Karidis: Thank you. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a couple of additional questions on the price increase please. So you answered the question about timing early February. Can you also tell us what proportion of your revenue in Nigeria is relevant to this price increase please? And then related to this – it's sort of quite clear that your exposure, for example, your OpEx exposure to the U.S. dollar is significantly lower than your largest competitors. And certainly to date you've been very keen to keep prices as low as possible in order to encourage greater usage and greater take up. So, do you foresee going forward some sort of diversion in the strategy between you and others regarding taking advantage of this price increase please? And then the sort of second and final question from me. By my calculations you are likely to keep upstreaming a significant amount of cash to the Holdco and I note your second buyback but it's not like the liquidity of your stock is significant. So, there is a very small percentage of the equity that's actually listed. So, what other ways would you encourage us to think about when it comes to returning cash to shareholders please?\nSunil Taldar: Thanks John for those questions. Let me answer the first one. For the third one I'll hand over to Jaideep to answer the third question. On your first question, circa 75% of the revenue in Nigeria is exposed to the price increase. And on your question, our stance on the pricing, see we've been reaching out to the authorities and seeking this price increase over the last almost about a year now and we are very thankful to the authorities that they have finally listened to our request because this was more also to – this price adjustment was required to also repair, our overall business so that we continue to make investments in the growth areas. With respect to whether we would like to go for the full extent, right now the way we look at, as I said, we don't have any understanding of how the competition will react. So we are looking at what is required for us from the point of view of pricing, we've been allowed up to 50%. We've submitted our proposal and we are waiting to hear back from the authorities. With respect to driving growth, our focus is while pricing is need, we've been requesting for pricing and this was needed for making sure that our business remains robust. For driving growth other than pricing, what our focus is actually more on making sure that we continue to execute effectively in the marketplace both in terms of acquiring customers. Once we acquire customers, deliver great experience to our customers. And that's what we've been focusing on. And other than that, we've actually opened two other streams of revenue which is home broadband and focusing on enterprise and basically build capabilities to be able to go after these opportunities. That's how we see business and that's how we would like to – driving growth across the markets, including Nigeria. And we are very, very positive about the growth opportunities that the Nigerian business offers. So that's how we're seeing the entire thing. And pricing remains not one of the key focus areas for us to either drive growth or to gain market share. It's one of the levers the big focus is on, in market execution on acquiring customers, retaining customers and especially opening up two areas that we have not been very actively present in. And that is also reflected in some of the growth that we've seen in the Nigeria business.\nJaideep Paul: All right, so on the upstreaming part, let me clarify a bit. Firstly, Nigeria, because of last year and this year first two quarter devaluation, the accumulated loss has obviously gone out and Nigeria doesn't have distributable reserve. So there is hardly any way we can upstream money from Nigeria anymore, at least for next 12 to 18 months. Yeah, if everything stabilizes, it will still take about maybe two years to recover from the accumulated loss because of this foreign exchange loss which has happened unless there is a significant appreciation which happens and the loss is reversed, which is at this moment, we don't have too much visibility on that. Now if you exclude Nigeria, the other upstream possibility is from East Africa and Franco Africa, which we continue to do by way of two means. One, if we have distributable reserve, which is by way of upstreaming the dividend from the OpCo and the second is shareholder loan. Now the good news is that our shareholder loan, has started coming down significantly and there will be hardly any further shareholder loan repayment opportunity left out. Maybe after one or two quarter we will be completely done with the repayment of shareholder loan. So what I'm trying to say is that the upstreaming flow will come down because there is no further shareholder loan which is left out and Nigeria is under accumulated loss. So at least in near future, Nigeria will not be able to upstream. So the amount of upstreaming which you have seen in the past will substantially come down. However, will be sufficient to take care of the shareholder return based on the current dividend policy and the buyback which we have offered, so we will not be having a very significant amount accumulated at a full level to look at any further options or opportunity but the last piece is obviously the board will reassess based on the all parameters, the dividend policy and if there is any change in the dividend policy, we will let you know in due course.\nJohn Karidis: Thank you. Sorry, if I may just a follow up on something completely unrelated. I expect that if you had any news on the mobile money IPO timetable and progress he would have declared that already proactively. Can you at least at this stage talk about where you're hoping to list your mobile money business in which geography, please?\nSunil Taldar: We are still working, we still stand by the commitments that we made on the IPO, which was four years and that timeline is around July of this year. It is the same answer as last time that we had provided and we still have six months before we go for IPO. And we will give and we’re preparing for the IPO. The groundwork is in progress and we will keep you informed at the appropriate time. But there is – at this point in time, there is nothing more to share. But we stay committed on the timelines.\nJohn Karidis: Thank you. I just had to try. Thanks very much.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question we have comes from Taj Ibrahim of Chapel Hill Denham. Please go ahead.\nTaj Ibrahim: Yes. Good afternoon, and thank you for the presentation and congratulations on the recovery that we have seen in your numbers. My first question is around the price increase in Nigeria. So because we have seen several news flows around subscribers kicking against it and threatening to go to court, also in the early part of next month, the Nigerian Labour Congress is planning to stick the protest on the back of that they want the regulator to bring the 50% maximum down to 10%. So my question is, in the midst of all of this, sort of agitation, what do you expect in terms of the ability of the industry to push through with the approved price increase? Do you see any of these elements I’ve just mentioned as major threats to the implementation? That’s the first question My next question is actually around the IPO around the mobile money business. I know you have talked about the next six months. I don’t know if you would like to share a bit more color. Should we be expecting the month of May or the month of June? Just to give us better insight around what you are working with internally. My final question is around the capital expenditure. Which areas should we watch out for in terms of the deployment of CapEx in the final quarter and also going into the next financial year? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you very much for those questions. On the price increase in Nigeria, your – the authorities gave us this price adjustment after a very, very rigorous process of over the last 12 months to 15 months that the industry has been following and seeking price corrections or price adjustments and up and our demand was significantly higher. This is out there in the media. But after a very rigorous process and having considered the current environment in the market and also the need of the industry to continue to invest and deliver experience to our existing customers and also to continue to invest to bring more people, more customers into digital and financial inclusion, the authorities came to this conclusion of up to 50% price increase. Now having said that, this basis – the approval that we received from the authorities to go up to 50% of price adjustment. We’ve submitted our proposal to the authorities and we are hoping to hear back from them very soon. And then once we hear, we will roll up these pricing in the marketplace. Now on the IPO, as I replied to John on the previous question, our answer remains the same. We are working towards the timeline that we had committed. And if there is any update we will provide when we meet after the – in the next investor call at the end of the full year results. On your question on CapEx, we do not have guidance for next year. As we come close to the year, we will have more firm view on the next year likely investments and we will communicate the same during the full year FY2025 presentation. With respect to this year, we maintain our guidance of CapEx of about $725 million to $750 million. But we do believe that CapEx will come towards the bottom end of the range provided and – but our overall priority remains around investing in our business and sustain the strong levels of growth that we’ve seen of late.\nTaj Ibrahim: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question we have comes from Jonathan Kennedy-Good of Prescient Securities. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: Good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. Just a follow-up on the CapEx and network quality at the moment. Can you give us a sense of how the network has performed given a low level of investment since the currency collapse and in the past there have been quality of service KPIs that have been stringently applied by the regulator? Are those all being met at the moment? And do you foresee a strong reacceleration in CapEx given the price increase adjustments? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Thanks, Jonathan, for those questions. Let me just, first and foremost, say the – our CapEx that we said in terms of guidance at between $725 million to $750 million, even $725 million, at the lower end of the guidance will be very similar to the CapEx that we invested last year with respect to our network performance. If you look at our refresh strategy, our CapEx is – our customer experience is at the center of everything that we do and therefore we are very, very focused on delivering great customer experience to our customers, network and non-network both. On the network side, the question that you raised, one, there is a quality of service expectation from the regulator. We take those requirements very, very seriously and we comply with the – with already a service requirements cross. And this year, the CapEx – the number that we are seeing, if it's only a phasing and you will see a lot of CapEx investments in quarter four which will lead up to the guidance that we just provided. So from a network experience point of view, we don't have any concerns and we have enough tools, digital tools which help us to understand beloved customer experience and there are no concerns whatsoever that we have.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: Thank you. That's very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from Linet Muriungi of Absa Bank. Please go ahead.\nLinet Muriungi: Hello and congratulations on the strong earnings recovery. Three questions from me. One, do you anticipate further ARPU pressure from the price cuts in Francophone Africa? The second is on Malawi. Could you please expound on Malawi hyperinflationary outlook? And what is Airtel Malawi's net financial position? Is there any guidance that you could share on how we should think about non-monetary gain and deferred tax beyond Q3? And finally, in Nigeria, do you see any risks to your fixed data business stemming from Starlink's launch last year? Thank you very much.\nSunil Taldar: So let me first start with your last question, which is on Starlink. If you look at the fixed data business, there is a – the market is still – there's a massive opportunity and we've just entered that – this market effectively in terms of a very serious play. So we see this business to continue to grow very aggressively. There is no reason, because there is a very large market out there. With respect to Starlink, you must have read probably it's out there in the news in many markets given the constraint on capacity. Starlink has stopped to acquire customers. And as they add capacity that is the window that remains open with us. But we are exploring all opportunities and making sure that we stay focused on building our go-to-market capabilities both in terms of building network capabilities and go-to-market capabilities and then managing and servicing our customers effectively. So we are very, very focused on this opportunity. On the Francophone ARPU, the – if you look at a large portion of our revenue in Francophone comes from on data. We've seen exploration in the – in data revenue – data ARPU from circa 4.2 to 4.4. The data usage per sub remains very, very heavy at about 26%, 27% growth over last year. And we don't see any concerns per se. And with acceleration of growth and acceleration of our customer base, we have grown our customer base at about circa 12% – sorry, 19% in Francophone and that has kind of a – little bit of a bearing. But there is no concern from an ARPU point of view, because our data consumption remains very robust in Francophone. So that's on Francophone. On Malawi I'll hand over to Jaideep.\nJaideep Paul: Yes. So Malawi, what happened is, it's very technical account feed standard, but I'll try to simplify it. Basically Malawi what has happened is that last three years Malawi has crossed cumulatively more than 100% inflation. And IAS 29 suggests that there is an assessment which has to be done by certain authority to assess whether the economy is required to be reset at a – based on hyperinflation accounting or economics. So in this case all the big four they have done the assessment and came back and suggested that Malawi we should apply IAS 29 and IAS 29 suggests that we have to recast our balance sheet on the opening date for the non-monetary assets and liabilities has to be adjusted based on the CPI linked inflation and that adjustment is on the non-monetary asset and liability. Now in our balance sheet the largest non-monetary item is the goodwill and that’s why the impact of $308 million has come in the balance sheet to balance sheet adjustment. So the assets have gone up and the revaluation reserve has gone into the reserve in surplus. So that’s the way this accounting happens. So it is a balance sheet to balance sheet movement of recasting the non-monetary item like goodwill and couple of other items. But goodwill was the significant amount. Then you have to also apply the same principle from 1st of April for the current period. And again the goodwill has to be readjusted and adjusted against with the revaluation reserve. And that impact, the net impact is flowing through into the P&L. And that’s what you see that $14 million impact in the P&L which has come, it’s primarily because of the period 1st April, 2024 till December 2025. Just to add one more point, if this inflation continues and doesn’t come down, every quarter we have to do that adjustment and some amount can be further coming into the P&L because you are allowed to recast only the opening balance sheet, balance of the net impact has to come in the P&L. So broadly, I hope I have been able to explain this little tricky accounting standard, which we have IFRS accounting standard.\nLinet Muriungi: Just one very brief clarification – just one brief clarification from my point, the inflation of over 100%, that’s a cumulative three year inflation. Just to clarify that inflation isn’t over 100% currently. It’s the cumulative – they look at the cumulative three year inflationary levels.\nJaideep Paul: Yes, I mentioned that in the beginning.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is from Samuel Gbadebo from CardinalStone Securities. Please go ahead. Samuel, your line is live, sir. Apologies, we have no audio from Samuel’s line. The next question we have comes from Tracy Kivunyu of SBG Securities. Please go ahead.\nTracy Kivunyu: Thank you, gentlemen and congratulations on the numbers. My first question is on Nigeria. So we see an acceleration in subscriptions in the quarter. But when I look at revenue from second quarter to third quarter, there seems to be a bit of a slowdown. I just want to understand what’s driving that and how you are thinking of revenue growth going to the fourth quarter? Do you think it will stay through the third quarter base? Or is there room to accelerate back to second quarter levels? And then second is following on a question previously asked on quality of service. So with the current increases in Nigeria, the commentaries from both telcos seem to speak about heightened network quality requirements. If you could possibly capture that in a bit more detail, what has really changed in terms of the network policy demand for the regulator with the tariff increase? Is it uptime? What is it in particular that is going to change in terms of the network quality requirements from NCC? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Tracy, I think your audio was not very clear, so I’m just repeating the question so that our understanding is correct. Your first question is around Nigeria growth, is it sustainable or Nigeria growth has slowed down from quarter two to quarter three? Because audio was not very clear that the reason I’m kind of seeking this clarification.\nTracy Kivunyu: Sure, sorry about that. So yes, I was asking about the slowdown in growth from 2Q to 3Q.\nSunil Taldar: Right. Okay. So if you look at the growth in Nigeria, while it has moved from 38% circa to 34% in quarter two to quarter three, but the growth still remains very robust. We’ve seen about 19% growth in our voice usage and about 40% growth in our data usage. So the growth remains very, very, very robust. So it was 38% and 34%. It has a little bit of a base effect because quarter three last year, we saw a little bit of a surge in growth, but quarter-on-quarter movement remains very, very healthy in Nigeria. So therefore we remain very, very confident about the growth opportunities in Nigeria and we continue to invest in both in network and our go-to-market capabilities in Nigeria. So that's my response to your first question that you asked. The second question is around, just saying the quality-of-service requirements, the quality-of-service requirements that you know the regulator has as we are today also we are compliant, but we continue to make investments, which is, I was responding to another question. We remain focused on delivering both great voice and data experience to our customers and we are compliant of quality-of-service requirements and wherever there is there is need for us to invest more. Nigeria is a very strong growth opportunity for us. We will continue to invest and make sure that we continue to make investments in the right areas to sustain this level occur [ph], and we are in constant touch with the regulator and we will ensure that there is nothing incremental or specific where we are non-compliant that we have to do. We are compliant, we are delivering great experience that is reflected in the growth that we are seeing. That is also reflected in the consumption that we are seeing. And if there is any further investments to be made, as I said it remains a priority market and will continue to invest.\nTracy Kivunyu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from Madhvendra Singh of HSBC. Please go ahead.\nMadhvendra Singh: Yes. Hi, thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you hear me, okay?\nSunil Taldar: Yes.\nMadhvendra Singh: Great, thank you. So I have a couple of quick follow ups and then a couple more if that's okay. The first question I have is on your mobile money IPO plans, if you could confirm that is on track for I think August is the deadline, if you could update on that? Second question is again a clarification on your renewed leases. What we have seen is that CapEx has come down again this quarter. So just wondering whether there is any specific, let's say, benefits you are getting from the renewed power contracts, which allows you to have lower CapEx for longer in any way? And then the third question is on Nigeria, clarification. I think you're talking about that cumulative inflation of 100% over three years so that there any specific accounting treatment at Airtel Nigeria level. If you could talk about that, I'm specifically asking about hyperinflationary accounting if at all? And then final point on the price hike – of in Nigeria. I was wondering if you could share initial thoughts around elasticity, which you would expect and has the price hike been implemented already? Or is there any operational steps left still before implementing that? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Sure. So there are four questions. Let me just quickly respond to the first one that you asked which is on the mobile money IPO. The answer remains the same. We are right now working towards making sure that we remain committed to the IPO. In July is the timeline, July 25. And we have another six months and by the time we come back at the end of our full year FY2025 results we will be able to lend more clarity and address most questions that you know that have been asked during this call. On the CapEx, the question that you asked, there is, the CapEx number that you're saying it's nothing but the phasing, the guidance is what we said, we stick to our guidance of $725 million to $750 million. The only difference is the only additional point that we're making is the way it will be towards the lower end of the guidance. Having said that, it will still remain equal to very similar to the CapEx that we invested last year and therefore it has got no bearing on our ATC renewal, et cetera, et cetera. That doesn't have any bearing on our CapEx spend. We spend CapEx on the basis of the growth opportunities and the growth potential that we see that is the guiding force and that we remain committed to that/ On the third question that you asked, this 100% there-year cumulative inflation that was to Malawi and not Nigeria. As Jaideep was answering question to the other question that was asked on Malawi hyperinflation, in that context we made this point on cumulative three-year inflation being 100%, not Nigeria On your last question on Nigeria pricing, the Nigeria price adjustment, as I said, it is very difficult given say for example there are a few moving parts with respect to, it's a very, very positive moment. First of all I must say that and we welcome this, this decision from the authorities and thank them for having given this price adjustment to the industry which is much needed. Having said that, at this point in time how the competition will react? How the customer will react? It is too early for us to comment on the price elasticity or the impact that it will have on our business. With respect to procedure, we've applied for, there is, it's a standard process. We've submitted our plans and we are waiting to get back from the authorities and as soon as we hear, we will roll our price.\nMadhvendra Singh: That is very helpful. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Again, thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question we have comes from Myuran Rajaratnam of MIBFA. Please go ahead.\nMyuran Rajaratnam: Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity. I've got two or three questions. The first one is the data usage in Nigeria. It's about 12 gigabytes per smartphone user. Can you give us some color as to what this distribution looks like? I mean is there like 20% of the customers that use very high data, let's say something like 30 odd gigabytes and there's 80% using what to get the average back to 12, about seven gigabytes. Or is it more like a bell shape? Is there an 80/20 principle or is it more bell shaped? That's the first question. That's specifically to Nigeria. And then secondly in Nigeria, you mentioned that only 75% of the revenue is relevant for the price increases. Can you give us some more color as to what's not included there? What sort of service doesn't get the benefit? And lastly, the industry has been rightly saying that price increases are needed given your CapEx is largely dollar denominated and that to sustain even the smaller players you actually need annual increases. So that's something maybe not inflationary but sub inflationary but annual price ups. Is that something that's still being talked about or not? I mean given the dire state some of your smaller competition is currently. Thank you. Three questions.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you. On your first question, we are seeing a very robust data consumption growth per user in Nigeria which is a combination of two or three things. One is, as customers upgrade from feature phone to smartphone and then as from 3G smartphone to a 4G smartphone, that is the kind of increase that we are seeing. The usage normally is almost about we see a multiple and that also leads to an increase in overall stickiness of the customer in ARPU, therefore. Having said that, we don't declare numbers of composition of our base, but our focus remains on making sure that each time when a customer upgrades from a feature phone to a smartphone and especially from a smartphone to a 4G phone, that customer remains with us. We deliver great experience and then therefore drive consumption for – and drive consumption and that is being reflected in our overall data usage and data usage per customer. On the 75% price increase, the balance 25% primarily comprises of VAS services that we offer and the IOC revenue that we have. So these are two components of where, which is outside the purview of the pricing. On your third question on whether the annual price increases and therefore passing on inflation. See, right now, we have to focus on making sure that this price adjustment because this is where the conversations have been and we pass on this price adjustment and make sure that this is effectively implemented in the marketplace. That's what I think the entire industry is focused on. And that's the other conversation which is and really how does this happen going forward. That's a subsequent conversation that we need to have. And as we have more clarity on that, that we will provide.\nMyuran Rajaratnam: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from Ali Hussain of FIM Partners. Please go ahead.\nAli Hussain: Thank you very much and thank you all for this presentation. The question I had is slightly different is twofold. One is on Nigeria. I've noticed that the voice minute usage has been increasing and it's kind of surprising in this modern day world when people use OTT apps et cetera. Can you sort of comment on is this driven, is this fundamentally driven or is this because of attractive price offering which is allowing the minutes of use to go up? And then number two, I know the details on the IPO are scarce at this stage, but if I may ask, because you have private equity investors and Airtel Money as well. Are you going to be selling down in line with them or is this just going to be an exit for those PE investors? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Sure. Let me answer your first question on voice usage. See, if you look at Nigeria business, the voice usage is a function of our base growth and overall consumption usage. In many markets we see voice usage starts to taper down and people move to OTT if the voice ARPU or the cost is high. If you look at Nigeria, our voice ARPU is circa $0.90 and therefore there is less incentive or reason for customers to switch to OTT. And that's the behavior that we've seen. And then there is a large number of Fuji customers, which comprise of this voice usage as well. So that to a large extent leads to increase in voice usage consumption per customer. The third also is we are seeing acceleration in this is also the quality of the voice experience. And as we just keep expanding our coverage and we get more people into our coverage we'll continue to see some amount of voice consumption per customer going up, and this is what is reflected in our numbers so far. On the IPO, it's very similar to what I've said before. We are right now in the process of preparing for the IPO and we are committed to our July timelines. And any further detail on what happens to our holding and partners, we will provide as once we have clarity hopefully in the next call when we have the full year 2025 results, we will be able to throw more light on some of these questions.\nAli Hussain: Okay. Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is a follow-up from Rohit Modi of Citibank. Please go ahead.\nRohit Modi: Hi. Thank you for taking my question again. Just one follow-up, Jaideep [ph], for you. You mentioned upstreaming looks like difficult for next two years from different look at the OpCos, particularly Nigeria. How comfortable you would be to again increase the leverage at HoldCo level? And also on the similar lines, I believe the – one of the reason for increasing leverage at OpCo level was you're getting the tax benefit on your interest, which you're not getting on the HoldCo level. But given now you have losses at Nigeria level, you may not getting that tax benefit. So does that make sense for you now to move, have more debt on the HoldCo level than OpCo? Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: So firstly, I'll reiterate that our objective is not to create debt at HoldCo level unless it is taken for any specific objective, at this moment for running our operations, we definitely do not intend to take in loan at HoldCo. For a simple reason, all our income are in local currency, respective local currency and we have seen the turmoil which we have gone through in the last 24 months, right? Taking loan at HoldCo and repaying it through the local currency cash surplus is not the right choice at this moment. We have to wait and watch. Second, as such we don't need any money at HoldCo level because as I said that even though the Nigeria at least in next 18 to 24 months we do not have the opportunity to upstream against the dividend because of the accumulated loss which we have. However, the other OpCos continue to upstream. So I have given – tried to give a comparative that comparative to last year, this upstream will come down. But that is sufficient to take care of our dividend payout to the shareholder or even running the buyback program. So from a servicing perspective, we don't need a huge amount of upstream unlike earlier where our bond was due for repayment. So that part is not there. Therefore, our objective is not to create any HoldCo level debt at this moment and because we are pretty confident that from the other OpCo we will continue to do the upstream as per the requirement of the HoldCo for strictly for return to the shareholder.\nRohit Modi: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from [indiscernible] Securities. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity. So I have two questions. My first question centers around the $104 million exceptional gain you reported in Q3 2025. So you attributed this to the appreciation of Tanzanian shilling and the naira. So can you please shed more light into it because from my perspective, the naira didn't appreciate, I mean, between Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, narrowing between 700 to 1,000 [ph] in Q3 2024 and between 1,500 to 1,700 in Q3 2025. So where is the appreciation stemming from? Also, is this something we should expect in Q4 2025? And my second question is around the cost efficiency program. So can you also provide more insights into that as to what has been done? What is currently in the works and what we should expect in the future as well? Also, not to cherry pick your words, but in your press release, you mentioned that initial successes contributed to EBITDA margin accretion. So are you saying progress has slowed? Thank you very much.\nSunil Taldar: Okay. So the first question let me try to answer. So the way this gets calculated, September 2024, our closing rate and this was the official rate of 1,668.97 [ph], okay, that was September 2024 closing, which was and when we started the year it was 1,303. October, it went up to 1660, sorry, October it was 1,661 vis-à-vis 1668. So it was at the same level. November, it went up to 1,683. And December closing, it came down to 1,544. So, if you see the quarter impact, the opening was 1,668, closing was 1,545. And therefore, the Naira appreciated by 7.5% that impact when you do the, the calculation on the dollar liability gives you an appreciation benefit, which has been recorded in the books. Similarly, Tanzania, if I call out the number, the Tanzania shilling, has been 2,730, end of September has got appreciated to 2,445, which is 10% appreciation in Tanzania shilling. Again, the gain on restating the dollar liability has been recording. However, this gain there was, the total gain was roughly about 145 odd million dollar. But there was a depreciation of other currencies, especially on CFA. CFA has depreciated from 607 in September to 631, sorry, 587 to 631, which is again a 7.5% depreciation. Therefore, a part of that appreciation got set off by this depreciation of CFA in the four countries. And therefore, what you see as a net impact in the P&L.\nJaideep Paul: So on the second question that you asked, Samuel, on our cost optimization program, we launched this program, beginning of this financial. It's an ongoing program, which will benefit us in over a longer period of time. We intend to optimize cost by using technology as well as initiatives like renewable sources of energy, planning new sites at better grid availability locations, et cetera. So these are certain structural changes that we are doing to reap the benefits. And it had comes with a little bit of a lag. And, having said that, we've seen our EBITDA margins this year expand from 45.3% in quarter one to 46.9% in quarter three, which reflects the initial success of this program.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now hand back to Sunil Taldar for closing comments. Please go ahead, sir.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you. And I would like to thank you all for joining this call and I look forward to speaking to you again and hopefully meeting with many of you later this year. Thank you. Thank you once again.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that then concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

There will be an opportunity to ask questions later during the conference. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sunil Taldar. Please go ahead, sir.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you. Good evening. Good morning to everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm joined on the line by our CFO, Jaideep Paul; and Kamal Dua, our Deputy CFO, who as you will have seen from our previous announcements, will be taking over from Jaideep as CFO later this year. Alastair Jones, our Head of Investor Relations, also joins us on the call. We will shortly be answering your questions, but first I would like to provide you with a brief overview of our performance over the last nine months and in particular over the last quarter. Over the last few years there has been continued volatility in the macro environment, but more recently we've seen some signs of stabilization, which is encouraging. However, throughout the volatility, demand for our services has been sustained, which really reflects the strong underlying demand across our markets. The ability to provide these critical services despite the tough macroeconomic environment is testament to our focused strategy and resilient business model. The strategy we have adopted has continued to serve increased digital and financial inclusion, smartphone penetration has increased over 5 percentage points over the year, and the 18% growth in our mobile money customer base to over 44 million reflects our focus on providing a wide range of financial services to individuals and businesses that have been previously excluded from the financial ecosystem. These initiatives have translated into strong constant currency results with an acceleration in revenue growth over the last few quarters. Revenues in the quarter reached $1.27 billion, which was a 21.3% growth in constant currency, accelerating from 20.8% growth in quarter two and 19% in quarter one. Given the foreign exchange headwinds experienced over the last year, reported currency revenues grew 2.5% in quarter three. Before discussing our performance across our two main reporting segments, I wanted to highlight our performance on regional basis in the last quarter, including both mobile services and mobile money. In Nigeria, we continue to see encouraging trends with constant currency growth of almost 35%. In East Africa, revenue growth accelerated to almost 23% in constant currency and in Francophone growth returned to double digit levels at 10.2 percentage, which is an encouraging performance given the acceleration from 5.2% we reported in quarter one. [Technical Difficulty] combined with the real opportunities. This opportunity is further enhanced by the ability to drive increased financial inclusion through our mobile money business to promote economic prosperity across our markets. However, I have also talked in the past about the substantial growth available in other areas and we remain excited about the opportunity in the enterprise space, data centers and also the home broadband offering. Secondly, our relentless focus will ensure that the flow through of the revenues will continue to drive profitable growth despite the macroeconomic environment we will continue to focus on EBITDA margin improvements as a result of these efficiencies. Thirdly, as refresh strategy puts a greater customer experience at the center of everything we do. In order to do this, we continue to invest in our network and improve as well as simplify the customer journeys. Our derisk balance sheet and strong capital structure enables us to execute on these priorities. Importantly, in order to ensure sustained value creation for all stakeholders and to be able to achieve these strategic objectives, the business must be underpinned by a strong risk management framework. Our robust corporate governance strategy is aimed at mitigating risks that we are exposed to. I'm happy to say that our track record speaks for itself. We will maintain this rigorous approach to create value for all stakeholders. And finally, before handing it over to the Q&A, I thought it worthwhile highlighting the recent developments in Nigeria where the NCC has granted approvals for tariff adjustments. We are very grateful to the relevant authorities for these approvals, which we believe is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the industry and enable us to continue providing reliable and affordable services to our customers. We are aware of the inflationary pressures consumers in Nigeria are facing, but see this development as key to maintaining our infrastructure investment to provide a value for money proposition that prioritizes customer experience. And with that I would like to now open the line for questions for which I'm joined by Jaideep. Operator, I now hand over to you to facilitate the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] The first question that we have comes from Rohit Modi of Citibank. Please go ahead.\nRohit Modi: Hi. Congratulations on good set of result and thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. A couple of them for me. Firstly, on price increase situation in Nigeria if you can give more color around, now that you've got approval, what kind of price increase do you expect? I believe we've got 50% – maximum 50% approval, but not sure if that's – that's – that's kind of price increase you're looking for in the market. And secondly, if you can I understand that it's too early but it can give any ballpark or any sense around what kind of margin improvement that you can see, with any percentage of price increase that you see. My question is around if you see 10% price increase, what kind of margin flow that flows into the margin going forward? Lastly, on Francophone we have seen a bit of erosion in margins in Francophone as well, apart from Nigeria. Are there any specific countries that you're seeing – where you're seeing most more margin erosion in that region? That would be great. Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Sure, thanks Rohit. So let me take the first question on Nigeria price increase. See, firstly, we are grateful to the Nigerian authorities for the approvals we received, which we see as very supportive for the entire industry and support continued investment into digital infrastructure across Nigeria. With regards to the impact of these tariff adjustments on our business, the approvals are clearly a very positive development and combined with recent signs of macro stability, we expect a positive outcome to our business following these developments. However, see there is a little bit of an uncertainty around the competitive action around these tariff increases and the elasticity of demand in the method whereby these tariff increases can be implemented. As a result of some of these questions which remain slightly unanswered at this point in time, it is very early for us to conclude on the real impact that this tariff increase will have on our business. We expect to initiate these adjustments in early February, once we hear back from the authorities and these actions have had time to play out. We will have more visibility on the potential impact which is when we will be able to provide better context to the market on the impact of price increase on the overall growth and therefore on the margin improvement. On the margin side, as we said that it's a very positive development, the additional revenue we expect will not come with material cost increase and therefore we should see – we are able to see an uplift in revenue trends as supportive for the EBITDA margin progression. That's how we see this entire pricing play out with respect to impact on our overall revenue growth and also margin progression. With respect to Francophone, which is the third question that you asked, we've seen growth accelerate in Francophone from circa 5% growth that we reported in francophone in quarter one to a double digit growth that we're reporting in this quarter of 10.2 percentage points. So growth has done well. The margin progression from – on quarter-to-quarter, from last quarter to this quarter we're seeing slight dip which is primarily due to the higher marketing spends that we have had to drive our growth and sweat our assets in Francophone. That's the only thing. Other than that there is nothing else.\nRohit Modi: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from John Karidis of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Thank you.\nJohn Karidis: Thank you. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a couple of additional questions on the price increase please. So you answered the question about timing early February. Can you also tell us what proportion of your revenue in Nigeria is relevant to this price increase please? And then related to this – it's sort of quite clear that your exposure, for example, your OpEx exposure to the U.S. dollar is significantly lower than your largest competitors. And certainly to date you've been very keen to keep prices as low as possible in order to encourage greater usage and greater take up. So, do you foresee going forward some sort of diversion in the strategy between you and others regarding taking advantage of this price increase please? And then the sort of second and final question from me. By my calculations you are likely to keep upstreaming a significant amount of cash to the Holdco and I note your second buyback but it's not like the liquidity of your stock is significant. So, there is a very small percentage of the equity that's actually listed. So, what other ways would you encourage us to think about when it comes to returning cash to shareholders please?\nSunil Taldar: Thanks John for those questions. Let me answer the first one. For the third one I'll hand over to Jaideep to answer the third question. On your first question, circa 75% of the revenue in Nigeria is exposed to the price increase. And on your question, our stance on the pricing, see we've been reaching out to the authorities and seeking this price increase over the last almost about a year now and we are very thankful to the authorities that they have finally listened to our request because this was more also to – this price adjustment was required to also repair, our overall business so that we continue to make investments in the growth areas. With respect to whether we would like to go for the full extent, right now the way we look at, as I said, we don't have any understanding of how the competition will react. So we are looking at what is required for us from the point of view of pricing, we've been allowed up to 50%. We've submitted our proposal and we are waiting to hear back from the authorities. With respect to driving growth, our focus is while pricing is need, we've been requesting for pricing and this was needed for making sure that our business remains robust. For driving growth other than pricing, what our focus is actually more on making sure that we continue to execute effectively in the marketplace both in terms of acquiring customers. Once we acquire customers, deliver great experience to our customers. And that's what we've been focusing on. And other than that, we've actually opened two other streams of revenue which is home broadband and focusing on enterprise and basically build capabilities to be able to go after these opportunities. That's how we see business and that's how we would like to – driving growth across the markets, including Nigeria. And we are very, very positive about the growth opportunities that the Nigerian business offers. So that's how we're seeing the entire thing. And pricing remains not one of the key focus areas for us to either drive growth or to gain market share. It's one of the levers the big focus is on, in market execution on acquiring customers, retaining customers and especially opening up two areas that we have not been very actively present in. And that is also reflected in some of the growth that we've seen in the Nigeria business.\nJaideep Paul: All right, so on the upstreaming part, let me clarify a bit. Firstly, Nigeria, because of last year and this year first two quarter devaluation, the accumulated loss has obviously gone out and Nigeria doesn't have distributable reserve. So there is hardly any way we can upstream money from Nigeria anymore, at least for next 12 to 18 months. Yeah, if everything stabilizes, it will still take about maybe two years to recover from the accumulated loss because of this foreign exchange loss which has happened unless there is a significant appreciation which happens and the loss is reversed, which is at this moment, we don't have too much visibility on that. Now if you exclude Nigeria, the other upstream possibility is from East Africa and Franco Africa, which we continue to do by way of two means. One, if we have distributable reserve, which is by way of upstreaming the dividend from the OpCo and the second is shareholder loan. Now the good news is that our shareholder loan, has started coming down significantly and there will be hardly any further shareholder loan repayment opportunity left out. Maybe after one or two quarter we will be completely done with the repayment of shareholder loan. So what I'm trying to say is that the upstreaming flow will come down because there is no further shareholder loan which is left out and Nigeria is under accumulated loss. So at least in near future, Nigeria will not be able to upstream. So the amount of upstreaming which you have seen in the past will substantially come down. However, will be sufficient to take care of the shareholder return based on the current dividend policy and the buyback which we have offered, so we will not be having a very significant amount accumulated at a full level to look at any further options or opportunity but the last piece is obviously the board will reassess based on the all parameters, the dividend policy and if there is any change in the dividend policy, we will let you know in due course.\nJohn Karidis: Thank you. Sorry, if I may just a follow up on something completely unrelated. I expect that if you had any news on the mobile money IPO timetable and progress he would have declared that already proactively. Can you at least at this stage talk about where you're hoping to list your mobile money business in which geography, please?\nSunil Taldar: We are still working, we still stand by the commitments that we made on the IPO, which was four years and that timeline is around July of this year. It is the same answer as last time that we had provided and we still have six months before we go for IPO. And we will give and we’re preparing for the IPO. The groundwork is in progress and we will keep you informed at the appropriate time. But there is – at this point in time, there is nothing more to share. But we stay committed on the timelines.\nJohn Karidis: Thank you. I just had to try. Thanks very much.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question we have comes from Taj Ibrahim of Chapel Hill Denham. Please go ahead.\nTaj Ibrahim: Yes. Good afternoon, and thank you for the presentation and congratulations on the recovery that we have seen in your numbers. My first question is around the price increase in Nigeria. So because we have seen several news flows around subscribers kicking against it and threatening to go to court, also in the early part of next month, the Nigerian Labour Congress is planning to stick the protest on the back of that they want the regulator to bring the 50% maximum down to 10%. So my question is, in the midst of all of this, sort of agitation, what do you expect in terms of the ability of the industry to push through with the approved price increase? Do you see any of these elements I’ve just mentioned as major threats to the implementation? That’s the first question My next question is actually around the IPO around the mobile money business. I know you have talked about the next six months. I don’t know if you would like to share a bit more color. Should we be expecting the month of May or the month of June? Just to give us better insight around what you are working with internally. My final question is around the capital expenditure. Which areas should we watch out for in terms of the deployment of CapEx in the final quarter and also going into the next financial year? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you very much for those questions. On the price increase in Nigeria, your – the authorities gave us this price adjustment after a very, very rigorous process of over the last 12 months to 15 months that the industry has been following and seeking price corrections or price adjustments and up and our demand was significantly higher. This is out there in the media. But after a very rigorous process and having considered the current environment in the market and also the need of the industry to continue to invest and deliver experience to our existing customers and also to continue to invest to bring more people, more customers into digital and financial inclusion, the authorities came to this conclusion of up to 50% price increase. Now having said that, this basis – the approval that we received from the authorities to go up to 50% of price adjustment. We’ve submitted our proposal to the authorities and we are hoping to hear back from them very soon. And then once we hear, we will roll up these pricing in the marketplace. Now on the IPO, as I replied to John on the previous question, our answer remains the same. We are working towards the timeline that we had committed. And if there is any update we will provide when we meet after the – in the next investor call at the end of the full year results. On your question on CapEx, we do not have guidance for next year. As we come close to the year, we will have more firm view on the next year likely investments and we will communicate the same during the full year FY2025 presentation. With respect to this year, we maintain our guidance of CapEx of about $725 million to $750 million. But we do believe that CapEx will come towards the bottom end of the range provided and – but our overall priority remains around investing in our business and sustain the strong levels of growth that we’ve seen of late.\nTaj Ibrahim: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question we have comes from Jonathan Kennedy-Good of Prescient Securities. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: Good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. Just a follow-up on the CapEx and network quality at the moment. Can you give us a sense of how the network has performed given a low level of investment since the currency collapse and in the past there have been quality of service KPIs that have been stringently applied by the regulator? Are those all being met at the moment? And do you foresee a strong reacceleration in CapEx given the price increase adjustments? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Thanks, Jonathan, for those questions. Let me just, first and foremost, say the – our CapEx that we said in terms of guidance at between $725 million to $750 million, even $725 million, at the lower end of the guidance will be very similar to the CapEx that we invested last year with respect to our network performance. If you look at our refresh strategy, our CapEx is – our customer experience is at the center of everything that we do and therefore we are very, very focused on delivering great customer experience to our customers, network and non-network both. On the network side, the question that you raised, one, there is a quality of service expectation from the regulator. We take those requirements very, very seriously and we comply with the – with already a service requirements cross. And this year, the CapEx – the number that we are seeing, if it's only a phasing and you will see a lot of CapEx investments in quarter four which will lead up to the guidance that we just provided. So from a network experience point of view, we don't have any concerns and we have enough tools, digital tools which help us to understand beloved customer experience and there are no concerns whatsoever that we have.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: Thank you. That's very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from Linet Muriungi of Absa Bank. Please go ahead.\nLinet Muriungi: Hello and congratulations on the strong earnings recovery. Three questions from me. One, do you anticipate further ARPU pressure from the price cuts in Francophone Africa? The second is on Malawi. Could you please expound on Malawi hyperinflationary outlook? And what is Airtel Malawi's net financial position? Is there any guidance that you could share on how we should think about non-monetary gain and deferred tax beyond Q3? And finally, in Nigeria, do you see any risks to your fixed data business stemming from Starlink's launch last year? Thank you very much.\nSunil Taldar: So let me first start with your last question, which is on Starlink. If you look at the fixed data business, there is a – the market is still – there's a massive opportunity and we've just entered that – this market effectively in terms of a very serious play. So we see this business to continue to grow very aggressively. There is no reason, because there is a very large market out there. With respect to Starlink, you must have read probably it's out there in the news in many markets given the constraint on capacity. Starlink has stopped to acquire customers. And as they add capacity that is the window that remains open with us. But we are exploring all opportunities and making sure that we stay focused on building our go-to-market capabilities both in terms of building network capabilities and go-to-market capabilities and then managing and servicing our customers effectively. So we are very, very focused on this opportunity. On the Francophone ARPU, the – if you look at a large portion of our revenue in Francophone comes from on data. We've seen exploration in the – in data revenue – data ARPU from circa 4.2 to 4.4. The data usage per sub remains very, very heavy at about 26%, 27% growth over last year. And we don't see any concerns per se. And with acceleration of growth and acceleration of our customer base, we have grown our customer base at about circa 12% – sorry, 19% in Francophone and that has kind of a – little bit of a bearing. But there is no concern from an ARPU point of view, because our data consumption remains very robust in Francophone. So that's on Francophone. On Malawi I'll hand over to Jaideep.\nJaideep Paul: Yes. So Malawi, what happened is, it's very technical account feed standard, but I'll try to simplify it. Basically Malawi what has happened is that last three years Malawi has crossed cumulatively more than 100% inflation. And IAS 29 suggests that there is an assessment which has to be done by certain authority to assess whether the economy is required to be reset at a – based on hyperinflation accounting or economics. So in this case all the big four they have done the assessment and came back and suggested that Malawi we should apply IAS 29 and IAS 29 suggests that we have to recast our balance sheet on the opening date for the non-monetary assets and liabilities has to be adjusted based on the CPI linked inflation and that adjustment is on the non-monetary asset and liability. Now in our balance sheet the largest non-monetary item is the goodwill and that’s why the impact of $308 million has come in the balance sheet to balance sheet adjustment. So the assets have gone up and the revaluation reserve has gone into the reserve in surplus. So that’s the way this accounting happens. So it is a balance sheet to balance sheet movement of recasting the non-monetary item like goodwill and couple of other items. But goodwill was the significant amount. Then you have to also apply the same principle from 1st of April for the current period. And again the goodwill has to be readjusted and adjusted against with the revaluation reserve. And that impact, the net impact is flowing through into the P&L. And that’s what you see that $14 million impact in the P&L which has come, it’s primarily because of the period 1st April, 2024 till December 2025. Just to add one more point, if this inflation continues and doesn’t come down, every quarter we have to do that adjustment and some amount can be further coming into the P&L because you are allowed to recast only the opening balance sheet, balance of the net impact has to come in the P&L. So broadly, I hope I have been able to explain this little tricky accounting standard, which we have IFRS accounting standard.\nLinet Muriungi: Just one very brief clarification – just one brief clarification from my point, the inflation of over 100%, that’s a cumulative three year inflation. Just to clarify that inflation isn’t over 100% currently. It’s the cumulative – they look at the cumulative three year inflationary levels.\nJaideep Paul: Yes, I mentioned that in the beginning.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is from Samuel Gbadebo from CardinalStone Securities. Please go ahead. Samuel, your line is live, sir. Apologies, we have no audio from Samuel’s line. The next question we have comes from Tracy Kivunyu of SBG Securities. Please go ahead.\nTracy Kivunyu: Thank you, gentlemen and congratulations on the numbers. My first question is on Nigeria. So we see an acceleration in subscriptions in the quarter. But when I look at revenue from second quarter to third quarter, there seems to be a bit of a slowdown. I just want to understand what’s driving that and how you are thinking of revenue growth going to the fourth quarter? Do you think it will stay through the third quarter base? Or is there room to accelerate back to second quarter levels? And then second is following on a question previously asked on quality of service. So with the current increases in Nigeria, the commentaries from both telcos seem to speak about heightened network quality requirements. If you could possibly capture that in a bit more detail, what has really changed in terms of the network policy demand for the regulator with the tariff increase? Is it uptime? What is it in particular that is going to change in terms of the network quality requirements from NCC? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Tracy, I think your audio was not very clear, so I’m just repeating the question so that our understanding is correct. Your first question is around Nigeria growth, is it sustainable or Nigeria growth has slowed down from quarter two to quarter three? Because audio was not very clear that the reason I’m kind of seeking this clarification.\nTracy Kivunyu: Sure, sorry about that. So yes, I was asking about the slowdown in growth from 2Q to 3Q.\nSunil Taldar: Right. Okay. So if you look at the growth in Nigeria, while it has moved from 38% circa to 34% in quarter two to quarter three, but the growth still remains very robust. We’ve seen about 19% growth in our voice usage and about 40% growth in our data usage. So the growth remains very, very, very robust. So it was 38% and 34%. It has a little bit of a base effect because quarter three last year, we saw a little bit of a surge in growth, but quarter-on-quarter movement remains very, very healthy in Nigeria. So therefore we remain very, very confident about the growth opportunities in Nigeria and we continue to invest in both in network and our go-to-market capabilities in Nigeria. So that's my response to your first question that you asked. The second question is around, just saying the quality-of-service requirements, the quality-of-service requirements that you know the regulator has as we are today also we are compliant, but we continue to make investments, which is, I was responding to another question. We remain focused on delivering both great voice and data experience to our customers and we are compliant of quality-of-service requirements and wherever there is there is need for us to invest more. Nigeria is a very strong growth opportunity for us. We will continue to invest and make sure that we continue to make investments in the right areas to sustain this level occur [ph], and we are in constant touch with the regulator and we will ensure that there is nothing incremental or specific where we are non-compliant that we have to do. We are compliant, we are delivering great experience that is reflected in the growth that we are seeing. That is also reflected in the consumption that we are seeing. And if there is any further investments to be made, as I said it remains a priority market and will continue to invest.\nTracy Kivunyu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from Madhvendra Singh of HSBC. Please go ahead.\nMadhvendra Singh: Yes. Hi, thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you hear me, okay?\nSunil Taldar: Yes.\nMadhvendra Singh: Great, thank you. So I have a couple of quick follow ups and then a couple more if that's okay. The first question I have is on your mobile money IPO plans, if you could confirm that is on track for I think August is the deadline, if you could update on that? Second question is again a clarification on your renewed leases. What we have seen is that CapEx has come down again this quarter. So just wondering whether there is any specific, let's say, benefits you are getting from the renewed power contracts, which allows you to have lower CapEx for longer in any way? And then the third question is on Nigeria, clarification. I think you're talking about that cumulative inflation of 100% over three years so that there any specific accounting treatment at Airtel Nigeria level. If you could talk about that, I'm specifically asking about hyperinflationary accounting if at all? And then final point on the price hike – of in Nigeria. I was wondering if you could share initial thoughts around elasticity, which you would expect and has the price hike been implemented already? Or is there any operational steps left still before implementing that? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Sure. So there are four questions. Let me just quickly respond to the first one that you asked which is on the mobile money IPO. The answer remains the same. We are right now working towards making sure that we remain committed to the IPO. In July is the timeline, July 25. And we have another six months and by the time we come back at the end of our full year FY2025 results we will be able to lend more clarity and address most questions that you know that have been asked during this call. On the CapEx, the question that you asked, there is, the CapEx number that you're saying it's nothing but the phasing, the guidance is what we said, we stick to our guidance of $725 million to $750 million. The only difference is the only additional point that we're making is the way it will be towards the lower end of the guidance. Having said that, it will still remain equal to very similar to the CapEx that we invested last year and therefore it has got no bearing on our ATC renewal, et cetera, et cetera. That doesn't have any bearing on our CapEx spend. We spend CapEx on the basis of the growth opportunities and the growth potential that we see that is the guiding force and that we remain committed to that/ On the third question that you asked, this 100% there-year cumulative inflation that was to Malawi and not Nigeria. As Jaideep was answering question to the other question that was asked on Malawi hyperinflation, in that context we made this point on cumulative three-year inflation being 100%, not Nigeria On your last question on Nigeria pricing, the Nigeria price adjustment, as I said, it is very difficult given say for example there are a few moving parts with respect to, it's a very, very positive moment. First of all I must say that and we welcome this, this decision from the authorities and thank them for having given this price adjustment to the industry which is much needed. Having said that, at this point in time how the competition will react? How the customer will react? It is too early for us to comment on the price elasticity or the impact that it will have on our business. With respect to procedure, we've applied for, there is, it's a standard process. We've submitted our plans and we are waiting to get back from the authorities and as soon as we hear, we will roll our price.\nMadhvendra Singh: That is very helpful. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Again, thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question we have comes from Myuran Rajaratnam of MIBFA. Please go ahead.\nMyuran Rajaratnam: Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity. I've got two or three questions. The first one is the data usage in Nigeria. It's about 12 gigabytes per smartphone user. Can you give us some color as to what this distribution looks like? I mean is there like 20% of the customers that use very high data, let's say something like 30 odd gigabytes and there's 80% using what to get the average back to 12, about seven gigabytes. Or is it more like a bell shape? Is there an 80/20 principle or is it more bell shaped? That's the first question. That's specifically to Nigeria. And then secondly in Nigeria, you mentioned that only 75% of the revenue is relevant for the price increases. Can you give us some more color as to what's not included there? What sort of service doesn't get the benefit? And lastly, the industry has been rightly saying that price increases are needed given your CapEx is largely dollar denominated and that to sustain even the smaller players you actually need annual increases. So that's something maybe not inflationary but sub inflationary but annual price ups. Is that something that's still being talked about or not? I mean given the dire state some of your smaller competition is currently. Thank you. Three questions.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you. On your first question, we are seeing a very robust data consumption growth per user in Nigeria which is a combination of two or three things. One is, as customers upgrade from feature phone to smartphone and then as from 3G smartphone to a 4G smartphone, that is the kind of increase that we are seeing. The usage normally is almost about we see a multiple and that also leads to an increase in overall stickiness of the customer in ARPU, therefore. Having said that, we don't declare numbers of composition of our base, but our focus remains on making sure that each time when a customer upgrades from a feature phone to a smartphone and especially from a smartphone to a 4G phone, that customer remains with us. We deliver great experience and then therefore drive consumption for – and drive consumption and that is being reflected in our overall data usage and data usage per customer. On the 75% price increase, the balance 25% primarily comprises of VAS services that we offer and the IOC revenue that we have. So these are two components of where, which is outside the purview of the pricing. On your third question on whether the annual price increases and therefore passing on inflation. See, right now, we have to focus on making sure that this price adjustment because this is where the conversations have been and we pass on this price adjustment and make sure that this is effectively implemented in the marketplace. That's what I think the entire industry is focused on. And that's the other conversation which is and really how does this happen going forward. That's a subsequent conversation that we need to have. And as we have more clarity on that, that we will provide.\nMyuran Rajaratnam: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from Ali Hussain of FIM Partners. Please go ahead.\nAli Hussain: Thank you very much and thank you all for this presentation. The question I had is slightly different is twofold. One is on Nigeria. I've noticed that the voice minute usage has been increasing and it's kind of surprising in this modern day world when people use OTT apps et cetera. Can you sort of comment on is this driven, is this fundamentally driven or is this because of attractive price offering which is allowing the minutes of use to go up? And then number two, I know the details on the IPO are scarce at this stage, but if I may ask, because you have private equity investors and Airtel Money as well. Are you going to be selling down in line with them or is this just going to be an exit for those PE investors? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Sure. Let me answer your first question on voice usage. See, if you look at Nigeria business, the voice usage is a function of our base growth and overall consumption usage. In many markets we see voice usage starts to taper down and people move to OTT if the voice ARPU or the cost is high. If you look at Nigeria, our voice ARPU is circa $0.90 and therefore there is less incentive or reason for customers to switch to OTT. And that's the behavior that we've seen. And then there is a large number of Fuji customers, which comprise of this voice usage as well. So that to a large extent leads to increase in voice usage consumption per customer. The third also is we are seeing acceleration in this is also the quality of the voice experience. And as we just keep expanding our coverage and we get more people into our coverage we'll continue to see some amount of voice consumption per customer going up, and this is what is reflected in our numbers so far. On the IPO, it's very similar to what I've said before. We are right now in the process of preparing for the IPO and we are committed to our July timelines. And any further detail on what happens to our holding and partners, we will provide as once we have clarity hopefully in the next call when we have the full year 2025 results, we will be able to throw more light on some of these questions.\nAli Hussain: Okay. Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is a follow-up from Rohit Modi of Citibank. Please go ahead.\nRohit Modi: Hi. Thank you for taking my question again. Just one follow-up, Jaideep [ph], for you. You mentioned upstreaming looks like difficult for next two years from different look at the OpCos, particularly Nigeria. How comfortable you would be to again increase the leverage at HoldCo level? And also on the similar lines, I believe the – one of the reason for increasing leverage at OpCo level was you're getting the tax benefit on your interest, which you're not getting on the HoldCo level. But given now you have losses at Nigeria level, you may not getting that tax benefit. So does that make sense for you now to move, have more debt on the HoldCo level than OpCo? Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: So firstly, I'll reiterate that our objective is not to create debt at HoldCo level unless it is taken for any specific objective, at this moment for running our operations, we definitely do not intend to take in loan at HoldCo. For a simple reason, all our income are in local currency, respective local currency and we have seen the turmoil which we have gone through in the last 24 months, right? Taking loan at HoldCo and repaying it through the local currency cash surplus is not the right choice at this moment. We have to wait and watch. Second, as such we don't need any money at HoldCo level because as I said that even though the Nigeria at least in next 18 to 24 months we do not have the opportunity to upstream against the dividend because of the accumulated loss which we have. However, the other OpCos continue to upstream. So I have given – tried to give a comparative that comparative to last year, this upstream will come down. But that is sufficient to take care of our dividend payout to the shareholder or even running the buyback program. So from a servicing perspective, we don't need a huge amount of upstream unlike earlier where our bond was due for repayment. So that part is not there. Therefore, our objective is not to create any HoldCo level debt at this moment and because we are pretty confident that from the other OpCo we will continue to do the upstream as per the requirement of the HoldCo for strictly for return to the shareholder.\nRohit Modi: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from [indiscernible] Securities. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity. So I have two questions. My first question centers around the $104 million exceptional gain you reported in Q3 2025. So you attributed this to the appreciation of Tanzanian shilling and the naira. So can you please shed more light into it because from my perspective, the naira didn't appreciate, I mean, between Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, narrowing between 700 to 1,000 [ph] in Q3 2024 and between 1,500 to 1,700 in Q3 2025. So where is the appreciation stemming from? Also, is this something we should expect in Q4 2025? And my second question is around the cost efficiency program. So can you also provide more insights into that as to what has been done? What is currently in the works and what we should expect in the future as well? Also, not to cherry pick your words, but in your press release, you mentioned that initial successes contributed to EBITDA margin accretion. So are you saying progress has slowed? Thank you very much.\nSunil Taldar: Okay. So the first question let me try to answer. So the way this gets calculated, September 2024, our closing rate and this was the official rate of 1,668.97 [ph], okay, that was September 2024 closing, which was and when we started the year it was 1,303. October, it went up to 1660, sorry, October it was 1,661 vis-à-vis 1668. So it was at the same level. November, it went up to 1,683. And December closing, it came down to 1,544. So, if you see the quarter impact, the opening was 1,668, closing was 1,545. And therefore, the Naira appreciated by 7.5% that impact when you do the, the calculation on the dollar liability gives you an appreciation benefit, which has been recorded in the books. Similarly, Tanzania, if I call out the number, the Tanzania shilling, has been 2,730, end of September has got appreciated to 2,445, which is 10% appreciation in Tanzania shilling. Again, the gain on restating the dollar liability has been recording. However, this gain there was, the total gain was roughly about 145 odd million dollar. But there was a depreciation of other currencies, especially on CFA. CFA has depreciated from 607 in September to 631, sorry, 587 to 631, which is again a 7.5% depreciation. Therefore, a part of that appreciation got set off by this depreciation of CFA in the four countries. And therefore, what you see as a net impact in the P&L.\nJaideep Paul: So on the second question that you asked, Samuel, on our cost optimization program, we launched this program, beginning of this financial. It's an ongoing program, which will benefit us in over a longer period of time. We intend to optimize cost by using technology as well as initiatives like renewable sources of energy, planning new sites at better grid availability locations, et cetera. So these are certain structural changes that we are doing to reap the benefits. And it had comes with a little bit of a lag. And, having said that, we've seen our EBITDA margins this year expand from 45.3% in quarter one to 46.9% in quarter three, which reflects the initial success of this program.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now hand back to Sunil Taldar for closing comments. Please go ahead, sir.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you. And I would like to thank you all for joining this call and I look forward to speaking to you again and hopefully meeting with many of you later this year. Thank you. Thank you once again.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that then concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sunil Taldar. Please go ahead, sir.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you. Hello, everyone and thank you all for joining us today. I have with me, Jaideep, our Group CFO; Kamal Dua, our Deputy CFO; and Alastair, who is Head of Investor Relations. Let me give you some brief highlights over the last 6 months before running through our Refresh strategy, which has been deployed across the organization and provide some context to the markets we operate in, and why we are so excited about the opportunity that is in offer across the continent. After that, I will hand over to Jaideep to run through the financials. Despite the volatile economic and operating environment over the last 6 months, we have seen very resilient demand continue to support a strong, constant currency revenue performance. Providing an attractive customer proposition at an affordable level is key to knocking this demand and we see this continuing to support revenue momentum. Over the period, we launched a cost optimization initiative to drive efficiencies across the business. We have already seen pleasing results, which is evident in the recovery of EBITDA margins in the last quarter, retaining our position as an industry leader in terms of operating efficiencies. During the quarter, we have also implemented our Refresh strategy, which significantly increases our focus on delivering best-in-class experience to our customers. And I’ll talk about this later in the presentation. Importantly, without continued investments into our network, we would not be able to provide these essential and affordable services to our customers. It is this sustained investment that is underpinned by our strong capital structure, which has been considerably dearest over the last few years, enabling us to not only continue investing for growth, but also create value for all of our stakeholders. Our purpose is to transform lives across Africa by bridging the digital divide and driving higher financial inclusion. Through the continued rollout of our mobile money services, over the year, we have seen smartphone penetration rise by over 5% and a 13% increase in mobile money customers reflecting the delivery against this corporate purpose. Being a business that is resistant to challenging operating environment has ensured that we continue to capture the growth opportunity available to us. Over the last 5 years, we have consistently reported double-digit constant currency growth, with revenues and EBITDA growing by a CAGR of 19% and 22% respectively. Earlier this year, we launched a comprehensive cost efficiency program targeting structural, ongoing efficiencies will not impact our growth ambitions. We’ve already realized some benefits in this quarter, with a sequential increase in our quarter two margins and we remain optimistic on our ability to realize further efficiencies. Over the year, we have continued investing in capacity and coverage and deployed over 2,800 new sites and an additional 3,500 kilometers of fiber, reflecting our sustained confidence in the future market opportunity. In addition, we have materially reduced our exposure to dollar debt with 89% of OpCo market debt based in local currency, which is up from 71% a year ago. The overall performance across the group has enabled the broad – the Board to reiterate its existing dividend policy with a further 9% increase in our final dividend. Let me now spend a few minutes explaining the significant opportunities across our markets and how our Refresh strategy will enable us to continue executing on this opportunity. As I’ve highlighted previously, I’ve traveled across extensively to our OpCos to understand the opportunity and to get to know our teams across the regions. The one thing that these travels have confirmed is the scale and size of the opportunity across our footprint. From a high level, we have an adult population of 384 million people, which is expected to increase by another 75 million by 2030. Furthermore, we have a unique ability to also offer financial services to our customer base, driving increased financial inclusion. As many of you are aware, from 90% of all transactions in Africa are in cash. And our unique distribution network will enable us to capture a significant share of transaction that innovatively will move to digital platforms. However, the opportunity is not only in consumer, the B2B or enterprise segment offers a particularly encouraging avenue for growth and we are actively working on capturing this demand as digital task, digital infrastructure across the continent evolves. Now to execute against this exciting opportunity, we have refresh our strategy to highlight how we intend to maximize a right to win across the continent. The primary focus of this Refresh strategy is to ensure a great customer experience. By embedding this in our mindset and our day-to-day operations, I believe we can truly differentiate ourselves from our competitors. To unlock this central premise, we have reviewed the pillars that will support this ambition. Firstly, we need to strengthen our go-to-market, enabling us to reach those previously may have been unconnected. Furthermore, it’s about investing in building capabilities so we can up-sell to our existing customers to enhance lifetime value of our customers. Secondly, a brilliant network experience is fundamental to ensuring our customers remain connected, and in many cases, can access a network for the first time, as we continue to invest in network capacity and coverage across our footprint. There are clusters of opportunities which have been identified using digital tools across all OpCos, which have been called out as must-win markets. Through micro marketing efforts, our teams are engaged in making sure that we win in these must-win markets. In the fourth pillar, we focus on the importance of digitizing and simplifying our product offerings to provide simplified customer journeys. As we continue to migrate towards the digital age, the importance of simplifying the customer journey will be increasingly important to accelerate customer acquisition and also improve our customer retention. Airtel Money remains a fundamental part of our strategy and is key to our ambitious success across the footprint. Accelerating the adoption of Airtel Money not only improves our customer proposition, but also has the additional benefit of driving improved financial inclusion. I will talk about the Airtel Money strategy in a bit more depth later on. And finally, our sixth pillar reflects the significance of the adjacent sectors across our markets, which remain untucked. In the absence of fixed line infrastructure, the home broadband opportunity remains significant and we have a real opportunity to scale that business into a meaningful standalone business segment. Our infrastructure across the continent also provides us with unique opportunity to offer a fully integrated suite of offerings or solutions to our enterprise customers or segment. Underpinning the strategy is a relentless focus on cost optimization to support our ambition for growth and continued investments into people and talent across the region. Our sustainability strategy remains a key support for our purpose of transforming lives and acting as a responsible business. I hope this brief summary helps frame our Refresh strategy. And now, let me spend a few minutes explaining the telecoms opportunity and how our strategy fits it. We are exposed to markets with some of the strongest population growth rates in the world as well as some of the most youthful populations. This, however, needs to be combined with a very low level of SIM penetration across our markets and smartphone penetration to understand the scale and size of the opportunity available. As these charts depict, unique SIM penetration remains below 50%, while only around 43% of our subscribers actually uses smartphone, which highlights the opportunity we have to see sustained growth in our customer base both in voice as well as in data. Slide 9 highlights how we will look to strengthen our go-to-market, enabling us to capture this opportunity. Investing into our distribution network will increase the touch points we have between our agents and our existing new customers. This alongside micro-marketing efforts and the simplification of our product offerings will differentiate the customer proposition. We have seen our voice revenue growing at almost 10% in constant currency, which is indicative of the scale of demand for even the most basic services across Africa. This, combined with unique – with continued increases in smartphone penetration, provides the foundation of continued strong revenue growth coming. For customers using voice services for the first time, the likely next step on their telecom journey is to take on data services. Data is undoubtedly an area which has a huge growth potential. We have discussed the low level of smartphone penetration, but even for those that are using a smartphone level of usage is still very low, below global levels. This has to be taken into context of the market environment, where fixed line infrastructure is essentially non-existent. So, the mobile data network is often the only way for customers to be connected to the internet. Slide 11 runs into how a strategy of providing a building network experience is fundamental to unlocking this data opportunity. The provision of a reliable and affordable data connection is extremely important to provide a great customer experience and support customers’ migration from voice to data services. Building capacity into our network and increasing the reach of our 4G network has provided the resilience necessary to become the operator of choice across our markets. Almost, 97% of our sites are on 4G and we have rolled out an additional 3,500 kilometers of fiber over the last year, which is key to unlocking this data growth potential. Importantly, other aspects of our strategy will help through micro-marketing actions of improving indoor coverage and increased network quality we expect a further improvement in providing a seamless user experience. Let me now briefly highlight the opportunity in the home broadband segment and why this opportunity remains very, very compelling. Research shows that households with broadband connectivity across Africa, remains extremely low on our footprint. As a result, the opportunity to offer home broadband solutions across our markets is substantial, utilizing our continued rollout of 5G network across a number of our markets. With data usage of our existing home broadband customers, amounting to 39 GB per month, combined with the ARPUs at a significant premium to our existing ARPU, we are excited by the scale of this opportunity over the medium-term. In addition to the telecoms growth opportunity, we are in a unique position to layer on additional growth in the form of mobile money to further enhance shareholder value. Let me spend a few minutes running through the opportunity and our approach to capturing this opportunity of mobile money. This slide reflects our mobile money strategy, which continues to underpin the strong performance across the mobile money business. Building on what we have discussed earlier, the first priority is to access to the customer base by building distribution and bridging – and bringing our services closer to the customer. This distribution focus, combined with a strong brand, will ensure a focus acquisition strategy to capture quality customers. Fundamental to future success is to build the products and offer across this ecosystem, we will rollout targeted services across the merchant network and drive the enterprise engagement by offering reliable and accessible services. We will also continue to innovate to drive increased use cases and ensure we provide the best customer service and drive increased digital adoption to ensure ease of access for our customer base. These services remain underpinned by a reliable and scalable IT platform, with a relentless focus on a strong compliance and regulatory framework, which across our markets and products is fundamental to the success of mobile money strategy. Mobile money services is all about driving increased financial inclusion across our markets. Low level of financial inclusion has been one key reason for strong customer based growth, but it has also been reinforced by the trust that has been built up – has been built up through the provisions of easy to use services with a focus on float availability, so customers can access their cash with relative fees as and when they need it. The facilitators of these transactions is our agent network, and once again, this has been and will continue to remain our core part of a strategy to drive increased base growth. We’ve seen a significant step up in our agent infrastructure and continue to prioritize the exclusive agent network as a key facilitator of this growth potential. Slide 15 demonstrates the continuing evolution of our mobile money ecosystem with annualized transaction value of $128 billion in reported currency. We’ve seen the makeup of transactions shift towards newer, more advanced services such as bill pay and merchant services as the ecosystem continues to grow. We are still seeing the digital wallet cash-in and cash-out services as the major source of mobile money revenue and there is still huge growth opportunity for this from increasing our penetration with new customers, but there is also continuing diversification of the business towards additional payment solutions and also more sophisticated financial services. Moving on to the enterprise opportunity, the growth of the enterprise segment and a scale of the SME sector provides a unique opportunity for us to tailor our services towards the ever evolving needs of enterprise segments. The recent activation of 2Africa submarine cable, which combined with over 77,000 plus kilometer fiber footprint across the continent, enables us to offer reliable, resilient capacity to our existing corporate customers, while also attracting new customers to offer a unique service at scale across the continent. Rising internet penetration, the rapid adoption of cloud computing and soaring demand for digital services will underpin our data center strategy. We have commenced the construction of data centers in Lagos in Nigeria, with another data center expected in Kenya. We will leverage our relationship with Nxtra business in India to draw on its considerable expertise and relationship with hyperscale players who will be looking to expand across African continent. Hopefully, that provides a snapshot of where we as a business are across Africa and reason for our optimism for the outlook. Importantly, we believe our Refresh strategy will be key to unlock the significant opportunities on offer. Let me now hand over to Jaideep to run through the financials.\nJaideep Paul: Thank you, Sunil and good afternoon to all of you. Let me start with the key financial highlights. Our reported performance continues to be negatively impacted by significant currency devaluation across key markets, most significantly in Nigeria, as well as macroeconomic challenges. However, we have delivered good underlying results despite these headwinds. Revenue growth for the half year was approximately 20% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in data and mobile money services. EBITDA grew by 13.5% in constant currency to reach $1.1 billion in reported currency. EBITDA margin at 45.8% decline from last year reflecting the impact of lower contribution of Nigeria post the naira devaluation and inflationary cost pressure. However, on a sequential quarter basis, margin improved by 124 basis points to 46.5% in constant currency, following the cost optimization program initiated earlier this year. Operating free cash flow at $771 million declined 22% in reported currency due to currency devaluation, as mentioned earlier, especially in Nigeria. And during the quarter, we had extended our tower lease agreement with ATC in 4 OpCos, which resulted in an increase in lease liability of $1.2 billion thereby increasing the leverage by 0.6x. Hence, the leverage during the quarter was at 2.3x as compared to 1.6x in June ‘24 and 1.3x over the last year. We’ll talk about this in detail in the coming slides. EPS before exceptional item was 4.9 cents lower from 7 cents last year, impacted by the translation impact of currency devaluation and higher finance charges. And the Board has declared an interim dividend of 2.6 cents per share, which is up by 9%. Coming to mobile services, our mobile customer base grew by over 6% supported by 9% growth in East Africa as well as in Franco Africa. In Nigeria, the customer base growth was flat as it was impacted by barring of customer as we fully complied with the KYC directive issued by the regulator. Data customers at 66 million were up over 10% year-on-year basis. Mobile service ARPU was $2.2 per customer per month, growing by 9.7% compared to the prior period, primarily driven by data ARPU growth. The decline in reported currency ARPU was on account of naira devaluation. Revenue for the period was $2 billion growing 18.4% in constant currency. EBITDA was $0.9 billion grew by 9.9% in constant currency, with an EBITDA margin of 45.1%, declined 347 basis points in constant currency. However, on a sequential quarter basis, margin has improved by 142 basis points. On mobile money performance, customer base at 41.5 million was up over 13% year-on-year. 26.5% of our total customer base uses mobile money services. Transaction value at $64 billion for the half year increased 30% in constant currency. ARPU expanded 11% in constant currency to reach $2 per customer per month as the expansion of mobile money ecosystem continues to drive increased engagement with the various financial services. EBITDA grew by 33% in constant currency to reach $247 million with EBITDA margin at 53%, expanding 167 basis points in constant currency. Coming to the next slide, the overall revenue growth was 19.9% in constant currency, while in reported currency, the revenue declined 9.7%. In constant currency, both data and mobile money services continue to see strong growth of 28% and 29% respectively with voice continuing to see encouraging growth of 9.4%. Reported currency revenue continues to be impacted by significant devaluation during the year impacting the half year revenue by almost $660 million. On the next slide, we show the group EBITDA performance. So EBITDA declined by 16.5% in reported currency to $1.1 billion. However, constant currency EBITDA grew by 13.5%. EBITDA has been adversely impacted by $348 million as a result of currency devaluation. OpEx increased by $271 million, out of which almost 45% was contributed by the network OpEx increase, which reflects the inflationary cost pressure, most notably in the fuel price across key markets, including Nigeria. OpEx increase, coupled with lower contribution of Nigeria, has resulted in decline in EBITDA margin from 49.6% last year to 45.8% in current year. However, as a result of our cost optimization program, we have seen a 124 basis point increase in EBITDA margin in Q2 to 46.5% as compared to 45.3% in Q1 in constant currency. So, coming to the regional performance. So first Nigeria, so let me briefly call out all the key conclusion from our recent performance in Nigeria. Despite the tough macroeconomic condition, we have seen revenue growth in Q2 accelerate to over 38% as we continue to see strong demand across the market. As discussed earlier, we disconnected subscribers during the quarter to align with KYC directive issued by the regulator, but the growth remains strong. Data revenue grew by over 44% in constant currency mainly driven by data ARPU growth over 30%. Data ARPU growth was supported by increase in smartphone penetration and usage. EBITDA margin of 48.4% have been particularly impacted by the 90% increase in diesel price over the last 1 year. However, margin has improved on a sequential basis as the cost efficiencies materializes and operational leverage offsets some part of the inflationary pressure. In East Africa, revenue grew by 21.7% in constant currency, supported by double-digit growth across all three services of voice, data and mobile money. Voice revenue grew by over 10%, data revenue by 26%, and mobile money revenue by over 31%. Despite inflationary pressure on the cost in certain OpCos of East Africa and the rising diesel cost, EBITDA margins remains resilient. Coming to Francophone Africa, revenue grew by 7.1% in constant currency with Q2 growth accelerating to 9% as compared to 5.2% in quarter one. This growth is testament to the initiatives we have put in place to grow the customer base and improve the momentum across the region. Data revenue grew by over 18%. Mobile money revenue grew by over 20%, while voice revenue declined by 1% in constant currency. Voice revenue was largely impacted by the interconnect rate reduction in some of the markets. EBITDA margin at 42.8% declined by 438 basis points, which was driven by the inflationary cost pressure, increase in fixed frequency fees in certain markets. However, on a sequential quarter basis, margin improved by 201 basis points. The next slide is about finance cost. As you can see, the finance cost excluding exceptional item and ForEx and derivative losses increased by $49 million, largely as a result of increased local currency debt in operating entities in line with our strategy to push down debt to the OpCo. Further, the change in debt mix between foreign currency and local currency coupled with the increase in the interest rate also impacted the finance cost. This increased local currency debt are however mitigating our exposure to exchange rate fluctuation by reducing the ForEx exposures. Exceptional item loss due to naira devaluation was lowered by $240 million as compared to the prior period. Further, non-exceptional derivative and foreign exchange losses in current period, was lowered by $154 million as compared to the last year. Next slide on EPS, despite our good underlying performance with double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA in constant currency terms, EPS has been negatively impacted by derivative and foreign exchange loss primarily in Nigeria. Over and above the derivative and ForEx loss related to the revaluation of USD liabilities and derivatives, currency devaluation also has a translation impact on reported revenue and EBITDA. Hence, EPS before exceptional item at 4.9 cents was lower as compared to 7 cents last year. Our normalized free cash flow despite significant currency and macroeconomic headwind, we are able to generate positive cash flow excluding license renewal payment. This slide gives a bridge between EBITDA and normalized free cash flow. The components of the cash flows include cash CapEx of $418 million, income tax payment of $200 million, license renewal payment of about $91 million, and other cash payment like interest, lease repayment and dividend to various shareholders, minority shareholders. Our capital allocation policy remains the same. Our key priority remains to continuously invest in business along with further strengthening the balance sheet. Our CapEx guidance for current year is between $725 million to $750 million. Our leverage at 2.3x was impacted by ATC contract renewal as well as devaluation impact on EBITDA. We have taken a significant step in reducing our exposure in foreign currency market debt with $809 million payment of foreign currency debt in the last year, including the repayment of $550 million bond in May 2024. Returning cash to shareholders through our progressive dividend policy remains one of the priorities and the Board has already recommended an interim dividend of 2.6 cents per share, reflecting growth of 9% in line with our currency devaluation policy – in line with our current dividend policy. The next slide, we have added this slide in this time since there are – there is a ATC contract renewal which has an impact in the lease obligation. So on September 30, we have renewed our contract with ATC for a period of 12 years on approximately 7,100 sites in 4 OpCos, namely, Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Niger. The 12-year extension period is part of commercial agreement with ATC. The longer term contract renewal is a win-win for both parties as it provides certainty of cash flows for the tower co and enables us to secure strong commercial terms in relation to the commitment ATC has made for investment into renewable energy solution which will result in reduction in consumption of diesel and corresponding cost. The benefit of renewable solution will come in the medium term. The impact of renewals on the cash flow of the company is neutral to positive. The accounting of renewals in accordance with IFRS 16 has been explained on the chart. In the left side that where you can see that the lease rental payment to the tower company remains same over the contract period. Though from the accounting point of view, there is a reallocation of lease rental between interest and principal repayment during various stages of the contract. During the initial period, the interest component is high and the principal repayment is low, which reverses over the later part of the contract. So in summary, the financial impact is cash flow of the company does not change, increase in right of use asset and lease liability by $1.2 billion, which is the present value of the future lease payment, which has resulted in increase in leverage by 0.6x, decrease in profit after tax by approximately $120 million to $130 million on an annualized basis in the very first year of the renewal, primarily due to increase in the interest cost without any corresponding impact incremental impact in the cash flow. 50% of this impact is expected in the second half of the current year. As we progress through the years, this impact will keep coming down in the – and from the middle of the contract onwards mid-term contract onwards, actually the impact will be significantly low. Our next slide on net debt, we continue to focus on localization of debt through de-dollarization program. As on September 30, 2024, 89% of the OpCo market debt is in local currency compared to 71% in prior period. We have repaid $550 million bond that matured in May ‘24 using the cash available at HoldCo. HoldCo is now absolutely debt free. The total weighted average interest rate was 13.2% vis-à-vis 8.8% in the prior period. Increase of this is due to higher local currency debt and repayment of $550 million bond at HoldCo level, which carried a lower than average interest rate. On leverage, we have already discussed the impact due to ATC contract renewal and impact of lower reported currency EBITDA on account of currency devaluation. As a result, the leverage at 2.3x was higher as compared to 1.3x of last year. If we take this entire contract on an operating lease method, the ratio of net debt excluding lease liability to EBITDA after the lease payment, the operating leverage will be 1x for the current period compared to 0.7x in September 2023. Let me now hand over back to Sunil for his concluding remarks.\nSunil Taldar: Thanks, Jaideep. Finally, on Slide 33 just a few words on summary and outlook. As you have seen from our results, our strategic focus has consistently driven positive momentum across the business. Key to delivering value to our stakeholders is to drive continued growth across our base. Our focus will remain on investing in our network and on further expanding our distribution to be closer to our customers, while at the same time looking at new opportunities for growth, particularly in data centers and fiber. Clearly, our results have been impacted by significant foreign exchange headwinds over the last 18 months, but the growth opportunity that exists across our markets remains very compelling and we are well positioned to deliver against this opportunity. We will continue to focus on margin improvements following the launch of our cost optimization initiatives earlier in the year. And with that, I would like to thank you all once again for your attention today. And we would now like to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have is from Rohit Modi of Citi. Please go ahead.\nRohit Modi: Thank you for taking my questions. I have three. Firstly, on the ATC contract, if you can confirm the terms of the contract, I understand the cash flow remains same, but the terms of the contract have changed, particularly talking about USD component and Nigeria and Uganda and Kenya basically, where you have – you are seeing higher FX volatility. Is there any change in terms of your FX component on this contract? Secondly, on your capital allocation within geography, I have seen Nigeria you have invested much lesser in Nigeria in first half compared to last year and much higher in East Africa. So is there any change in terms of your priorities or any reason for lower CapEx in Nigeria or is that just a phasing that you will phase out next half? Third question on again on tower renewals, if you can confirm number of towers that are due for renewal now in near-term on the rest of the footprint? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Okay. So first on the ATC contract, the absolute dollar component doesn’t change. It remains same. The absolute dollar component what was there earlier that remains same. On the second question, if I understand correctly whether CapEx reallocation we are looking at, the answer is at this moment, the CapEx allocation is based on the need of the business and the growth opportunity. We continue to do that including Nigeria. Nigeria also we are rolling out new sites, so that continues. On the third question on number of towers which is coming for renewal in this year second half, there will be about 1,100 towers coming up for Zambia renewal. Next year, roughly between 400 to 500 towers will be coming up for renewal and FY ‘27 another 1,200 towers will be coming up for renewal. So that’s the visibility which we have as of now, 1,100 in the second half of this year, 400 next year and 1,200 in FY ‘27.\nOperator: Rohit, does that answer all your questions?\nRohit Modi: Yes. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is from Maurice Patrick of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMaurice Patrick: Yes, thank you. Yes, from my side just a few fairly simple ones. The first question is on spectrum and I was curious if you could just articulate which auctions or allocations or renewal of spectrum that you have visibility on over the next 12 to 18 months? That’s the first question.\nSunil Talder: Alright. So, spectrum is based on the availability and affordability. So we will continue to look forward as it stands today immediately, we are – there is no auction which has come up, but we will continue to look at the spectrum availability and our affordability and keep buying spectrum, especially on the 4G and 5G rollout and that will continue. Not much of renewal, which is falling due in this year or next year, but in subsequent year FY ‘27 Nigeria, there is a spectrum renewal which will be falling due in the 900 megahertz. So that is in FY ‘27.\nMaurice Patrick: Great. Thank you. That’s the first one. Second question, in your prepared remarks, you talked about wanting to catch some of the growth in the data center market, which you highlighted a $7 billion opportunity by 2028, just curious as to what your strategy is to actually capture some of that growth? Thank you.\nSunil Talder: We see data center as an exciting opportunity in Africa in the years to come. And what we’ve done is we’ve currently invested in and we’ve announced 2 data centers. One is in Nigeria, Lagos, which is what I spoke about and another that data center that we are talking about is in Kenya in the short term. The construction normally takes about 24 to 30 months. So obviously we have to start now in terms of buying the land, which we have done. Second part is designing of the data center which is very critical post that construction starts. While the revenue from the data center will kick in from FY ‘26 onwards, but the investment has to start now. Additionally, what we are also doing is we have cable landing stations in a number of countries like Tanzania, Kenya, Gabon, DRC, these are also additional care opportunities. And we are constantly evaluating opportunities in this space. As I said there are two data centers we’ve already kind of signed off, one is in Nigeria, another is in Kenya. And we are constantly exploring opportunities on other data centers. Nigeria and Kenya is where we expect most of the demand to be centered in.\nMaurice Patrick: Okay, that’s clear. Thank you. And just the last question from me, you have spoken about how you’ve been reallocating debt from the whole company to the OpCos, which comes with a higher interest rate, I believe in terms of having that local debt. But I think you’ve spoken in the past about a tax efficiency. Can you give some clarity in terms of how we should think about modeling cash tax going forward in the coming years, post the reallocation of HoldCo debt? Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: Okay. So if we have a data at HoldCo level and since we do not have any major income at a HoldCo level, we don’t get the tax benefit which is on an average you can take 30%, 31% as a corporate tax – average of corporate tax. We don’t get that benefit. But when we take loan in OpCo and OpCo has a income or revenues. Therefore, we get a 30% – roughly about 30% tax shield on the entire interest charge. So in a very simple math, if you look at it, if the interest cost interest is coming at 20% for let’s say in a particular country and 30% is the corporate tax rate. So effectively, my effective interest post-tax comes down to almost 13%, 14%. So, that’s the way we look at it. The benefit is higher if we have a local currency debt and the local currency and therefore the interest which is charged into the local P&L. In addition to that, we also get the benefit. We are protected from any devaluation impact. And we have seen how the devaluation can impact and how severe it is in certain countries, especially in Nigeria and some of the large operating unit we are. At least from that perspective we are well protected. If devaluation happens, this debt will have zero impact in the ForEx and derivative loss.\nMaurice Patrick: Yes, it makes sense. Thanks so much and thank you for your answers.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Cesar Tiron of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCesar Tiron: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the call and the opportunity to ask questions. I have three, if that’s okay. The first one I wanted to check if you could explain a bit more the acceleration of the service revenue growth in Nigeria? That’s the first one. The second one, I wanted to check if you could explain what needs to happen in your view in Nigeria for the mobile money business to be more successful to be a – to account for a greater share of your of your service revenue? And then the third one, sorry, it’s all about Nigeria. But the third one would be on pricing. I think we’ve been discussing with regulators now for quite some time as an industry to ask for price hikes in light of the high inflation that we’ve seen in Nigeria. Do you think that will prove to be successful? Is there any update that you can give us? Thank you so much.\nSunil Talder: Thank you very much for that question. Let me first start with acceleration in our revenue growth in Nigeria. See, Nigeria is a very, very large opportunity. We’ve always been saying this. Our revenue growth of 36% in constant currency in the first half is largely driven by continued strength in the demand for data services across the country. Voice revenue growth was 23% and data at 44% for the first year. We are seeing – on the price increase front, we continue to engage with the NCC and with other institutions in Nigeria to seek price increase and this is something that we have been added for some time. And our attempt is to at least cover the inflation. Let me provide, apart from the price increase, a little more color to our growth in Nigeria. See the growth in Nigeria has been driven by very largely – is upgrade from as customers upgrade from feature phone to smartphone and that drives the data consumption and that drives the incremental ARPU and the revenue growth. And what we have been doing is we’ve been focusing our attention on higher end customers and focusing on the upgradation of feature phones to smartphones over the period, which is clearly evident in the improvement of our data revenue growth. In addition, we have also been prioritizing the opportunity for home broadband and this is something that we have called out last quarter as well, which is a large opportunity for us within the Nigerian market. We are encouraged with the growth we are achieving in Nigeria and we will continue to invest in order to sustain our growth markets in Nigeria. Having said that, acquiring new customers and low SIM penetration remains a very, very large opportunity, continues to remain our large opportunity in Nigeria. And we continue to invest in our network and most importantly on our distribution to acquire new customers. So acquisition of new customers, while it is currently not reflecting reflected in the base growth, because we had to bar a large number of customers in the – during the quarter to follow the regulation, as announced by the regulator. But we continue to remain focused on driving base growth. We continue to remain focused on upgrading customers from 2G to 4G and that drives data growth, high value customers and then finally home broadband and B2B are the opportunities that we are chasing on Nigeria. Now coming on our PSB business, which is the mobile money business in Nigeria, we’ve started seeing revenue exploration, wherein H1 ‘25 revenue grew by 367% YoY basis, while reported revenue have just doubled due to impact of naira devaluation. However, our priority remains to acquire decent customer base before we start monetizing them. Even on mobile money side, you would have seen our customer base has not grown because we had to follow the regulation and discontinue certain customers as per the regulation. Hence we continue to focus on expanding customer base and keep on building the very wide ecosystem required for monetization. I think it will take us a few more quarters for us to get to a decent customer base as well as revenue following the same. I am confident we are on the right path with the key action that we are driving. In terms of metrics, we have 1.4 million active customers representing 30-day revenue earning customers. In terms of agent network, which is our go-to-market, it’s a strong agent network of about 231,000 agents at the end of September. We have launched certain propositions, which is super bonus. Our cash back campaign that is being used for customer acquisition. And what we are now focused on is building our digital capabilities to offer more use cases to our customers, so that they can do almost all their transactions on our platform and that drives the growth of mobile money in Nigeria, because it’s also very world market, banking penetration is high and use of app is high. That’s really our plan and we remain confident that in the next few quarters, we should – as we build capabilities, we will continue to see improvement in our mobile money performance in Nigeria.\nCesar Tiron: Thank you so much. Can I please ask about the prices as well – the price hikes in Nigeria?\nSunil Talder: Yes. So, price hike in Nigeria, we continue to engage with the authorities in Nigeria. I’m seeking for a price increase to at least cover inflation. The ground situation in Nigeria remains – given the inflation and the ground situation remains very, very tight. We have not heard anything else other than the update that I just gave you to say that we remain engaged. The authorities have been apprised of the challenges that the industry is facing and it is an industry-wide effort which is currently happening in Nigeria. And as soon as we have an update, we will surely share. But this is update on pricing is what we have similar to last time. Having said that, the pricing is not the only area of driving growth in Nigeria, despite inflation, despite the pricing challenges that we have the industry and our performance continues very strongly. We have delivered a 38% growth in the second quarter. And what we intend to do is we continue to remain ahead of inflation and at least cover the nominal GDP growth, which currently the business continues to track. And we will continue to make investments in Nigeria, because we see a large opportunity in Nigeria. Soon as we have any update on pricing, we will update all of you as well.\nCesar Tiron: Thank you so much. That was very helpful.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Jonathan Kennedy-Good of Prescient Securities. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the opportunity. Couple of questions from me just on Nigeria, the CapEx numbers you have put in the ground in the first six months, and the CapEx intensity is up even though the dollar nominal CapEx is significantly lower. Just wondering, how long you can sustain a lower dollar number in terms of CapEx invested there? When will you run out of kind of network headroom and have to revise CapEx then upward again. And then just I know you obviously can’t comment too much on why your largest competitor has much higher margin compression in Nigeria. I think their margins have reached 32%. Are you taking some of these costs in derivative losses, and that don’t come through EBITDA, I just fail to understand why a bigger competitor has a narrower margin than you in Nigeria? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: First question, so I can start, and see. Sir, why we will not comment on competition and their investments, what we can talk about is our investments. We remain optimistic on growth potential in Nigeria. In order to capture this growth, we require continued investments to ensure that not only our customers benefiting from this level of investment, but that it attracts new customers, which is reflected in our pillar of providing a brilliant network experience. We retain a judicious approach to our CapEx investment strategy in order to maximize revenue growth. What is your other question that you have, it was, if you can just repeat that?\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: Well, I was just wondering whether you were taking – you are taking – are you taking some of the naira impact below the EBITDA line? I just failed to understand how you can preserve margin to this extent relative to competitors?\nJaideep Paul: Well, we don’t know the exact structure of the dollar component and local component in their operating expenditure. So, I can’t comment on that part. But I am – but from our side, we have over the period of time anticipating this devaluation, at least for last, I would say, 24 months. We have been actively working in reducing the dollar component based operating expenditure. So, we have converted most of our OpEx only 8% roughly about 8% to 9% of our OpEx is dollar denominated, rest are all local currency. And this was a conscious call which was taken. And therefore, while you see the finance cost has a severe impact because of the of the finance lease – of the lease liability, as well as some dollar debt which we have taken during that period when dollar was not available. But on the operating cost side, we have taken a position at least for last 24 – at least 2 years, 3 years. We have been consistently reducing our dollar exposure in the operating expenditure. And today it has come down below 10% and that’s why you don’t see that severe impact, except the diesel price impact, which is in local currency, but it is linked to inflation and the drop what you saw in Nigeria margin is because of the diesel price and not because of the ForEx devaluation.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: Thank you. That’s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Madhvendra Singh of HSBC. Please go ahead.\nMadhvendra Singh: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three questions. The first question is on your share buyback program, if you could update on the progress. I know that in the release you mentioned that you have used about $88 million. So, how much headroom do you still have left? And given that your underlying leverage excluding lease is actually quite low, and you are generating quite good cash, so is it – is there a possibility of increasing the overall share buyback program? If you could update on that side, that will be great. The second question is, actually a follow-up on the data revenue growth you reported in Nigeria, so again, very good performance there, acceleration during the quarter. But when I see in the breakdown of the drivers, so there is usage growth and there is customer growth. But if you could talk about how much – if that doesn’t add up to the overall 48% growth, I think 47% growth you reported for the quarter. So, has there been any underlying pricing adjustments you have been doing? So, has the yield also has been improving in the data space, if you could talk about that. And then finally, I was wondering about your power pass through component in the tower cost, that was a big headwind during the previous quarter, and I think sequentially, it has not been a huge headwind, but still that is why your margins are still probably not back to the 49% plus level. I was wondering, given that diesel prices have come off the peak now, I think. Oil prices have come down as well. So, in terms of outlook, do you expect any tailwind in the coming quarters? And if you could give some sensitivities or some quantification of how much benefit we should expect given where the diesel prices are in Nigeria, for example, right now. Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Let me take the first two questions. So, let me start with the first question that you asked on the buyback. See the shareholder returns are very important part of our capital allocation strategy. As you have seen, we have a progressive dividend policy, and we have been increasing our dividend by so called 9% over the last few years. This remains a primary method to return cash to the shareholders. In January ‘23 the Board decided to undertake $100 million buyback, which is now almost close to completion. Now, any further buyback will be considered by the Board considering the future cash position of the company. So, that is the answer to your first question. Coming to the second question that you asked with respect to Nigeria data growth, so I will answer this very simply. If you look at while our overall base growth in Nigeria is kind of flattish at about 0.2%, but we have seen acceleration in the smartphone base growth rate, which has grown by about 15%, 14.8% will be precise. And our ARPU has grown by about 27.9%. Now, if you add up these two that explains a very strong data growth that we are seeing in Nigeria. And this has been, as I have said, has been our focus to drive, has been our focus to on high value customers and make sure that we are upgrading our customers from 2G to 4G and drive consumption. That’s what is leading to ARPU growth, which is high data consumption and upgrades. So, that’s the answer to the second question. And the third question was on\nMadhvendra Singh: The cost for diesel, diesel impact, or will there be the tail wind, or what is the future outlook for…?\nSunil Taldar: See, very difficult to comment on the future outlook for – because if you look at the diesel prices in Nigeria, it had hit about NGN1,500 per liter. And then it is down to about NGN1,100 per liter now. And this is in the current quarter, and it is currently, as I have said, is trending at about NGN1,100. So, where will this diesel price go in the future is very difficult. However, what we have done, from our point of view, we are actually, at this point in time, working very closely with our companies to reduce overall operating cost. Network operating cost, few initiatives is, whether it is moving our sites from off-grid to grid, and that also reduces power consumption, solarization of sites using lithium ion batteries. So, we are drawing everything within our control to address the power cost of the network cost. Diesel, as I have said is, these are market forces, and it remains to be seen how it moves as we move along.\nMadhvendra Singh: I didn’t really ask about the diesel price movement outlook, I rather asked about, if the diesel prices stayed where they are, NGN1,100 what would that mean for the margins?\nSunil Taldar: Yes. So, firstly, the average diesel price NGN1,100, but September again, it moved up, it’s NGN1,226. But yes, if you, let’s say the diesel price remains static, obviously, then network cost per site remains static, and that should need to eventually maybe increase in the EBITDA margin in the future period. But the point is that this is such a volatile and continuous, moving element, it’s very difficult for us to say very firmly how much impact or how much benefit it will give us. But the point is, if it remains static and there is no change in next quarter, obviously that is beneficial for us, because then there is no incremental cost added, at least on the diesel side or the other fuel price in the network cost.\nMadhvendra Singh: Great. And just follow-up on the share buyback that point. What I meant to ask was that given you have solid cash flows, and you have already, let’s say, almost successfully completed the current program. Does your balance sheet and cash flow, in your view, allow for another round or extension of this program? Let’s say another $100 million. Is that something you think from a financial management point of view, the company can withstand rather than, I understand the decision is with the Board, but I am just trying to think from management point of view, do you think that is feasible?\nSunil Taldar: Well, we will not be able to make any comment on that. And the first tranche of $100 million is still not completed, so let it be completed. A couple of million dollars are still pending. So, once that is completed, we will go back to the Board with our recommendation, considering this year and most likely of the next year, because keep in mind that we are also investing in data center and so and so forth. So, there is – next year, there will be a full-fledged work on data center, which will start. And both the data center, I am hoping that both Kenya and Nigeria will go in action. So, we will consider everything, and then go with our recommendation to the Board. And then based on the Board recommendation, we will let you know what is the – whether there is any next lot of buyback program will be launched or not.\nOperator: The next question we have is from John Karidis of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJohn Karidis: Thank you. Thank you for this call. I have got a few. So, just two on mobile money, please. So, the first one is, could you remind me by when you need to have listed the mobile money business? And what would happen if the equity markets are not conducive to a listing? So, what would be sort of plan B as it were? The second, mobile money business – the mobile money question has to do with the profitability of the different sources of revenue. So, if I look at Slide 15, where you give us the revenue mix for mobile money. And if I have at the top of my head the 53.0% EBITDA margin that you reported for the six months, I can sort of understand that cash-in and cash-out is less profitable, but it would be lovely pleased to get some sort of idea of how much less profitable it is. Is it 5 points less? Is it 20 points less? And what are the sort of the relative profitability – the EBITDA margins of the other sources of mobile money revenue, please, versus the 53.0% average. And then lastly, regarding Nigeria, other revenue, I see that its percent growth rate has actually now exceeded that of data, albeit from a lower base. And quite honestly, I don’t really understand what’s in it. So, for example, things like fixed wireless access, is that in data, or is it in other? And if it’s not in other, what drives that growth, please? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: So, on mobile money, on the IPO progress, there is nothing has changed from our previous commentary. In terms of mobile money IPO, we are committed to undertake an IPO of the mobile money business within 4 years of initial minority deal. So, just over about nine months from now, and that timeframe still remains. The groundwork is in progress and we will keep you informed at the appropriate time. But there is nothing more to be shared at this point in time.\nJohn Karidis: Sorry. Sunil, can I ask what happens if that – if the equity market is unhealthy?\nSunil Taldar: Now, this is a – see this, obviously it’s a – I mean it’s a scenario analysis, which we will not be able to do at this moment. But yes, there are the options which are being evaluated. And as we mentioned that it is too early for us to comment on this aspect, that if it doesn’t happen, then what happens, and etcetera, etcetera. But those in appropriate time, maybe as we progress through the year, and if we go closer to quarter four, maybe we will have a better answer for that. And we will definitely update you if there is any change from the current date.\nJohn Karidis: Okay. Thanks.\nJaideep Paul: On your other question on mobile money, with respect to yield, very broadly our yield on cash-out is very similar to the yield that we have on, say, bill payments and merchants. So, that’s one, and that is the reason. And the other thing that happens is, as the use cases proliferate, so as customers start to use more – different use cases and use our mobile money for making bill payments, merchant transactions. One is, frequency goes up and therefore – and that drives overall revenue growth for the mobile money business. But very simply to answer your question, yield for cash-out and for bill payment and merchant are very similar in nature, and that should not be diluted when it comes to margin or overall revenue.\nJohn Karidis: Okay. I am sorry, does yield mean EBITDA margin in this case?\nJaideep Paul: No, this is yield. Yield will see EBITDA margin. Every services, you can’t estimate EBITDA, but what you can estimate is what’s my earning for that service. And let’s say, per transaction, what is my earning and what is my cost, and that’s what we call yield. So, minus so – suppose I earn, let’s say, $0.10, and my cost for providing that service is $0.03, then the yield is $0.07. So, from that perspective, what Sunil has referred as the highest yield in cash-out, because cash-out also has a corresponding payout to the complete agents. So, this is a net yield which we consider. Same way on merchant, merchant, of course there is no payout. So, the net-net basis, the yields are very similar.\nJohn Karidis: Okay. Thank you. And then in terms of Nigeria, other revenue and fixed wireless.\nSunil Taldar: See, fixed wireless currently is, - yes, fixed wireless is what we call fixed wireless is actually the data service which we provide to that mid, small and medium enterprises in Nigeria. So, what we call home broadband that’s in the B2C side, and fixed wireless is in the in the enterprise side, yes. So, that services is getting strengthened. And in the fixed wireless, in some places where we see a commercial benefit, instead of fixed wireless, then we go on a fiberization or fiber route, where the customer experience gets much better.\nJohn Karidis: Okay. Thank you. I see your other revenue in Nigeria was up more than 50% in local currency terms.\nSunil Taldar: Yes.\nJohn Karidis: So, what’s in other then, please? What’s the cause of that?\nSunil Taldar: Yes. So, it has a multiple revenue item. It has a VAS revenue, [indiscernible] revenue, FWL revenue, all these revenues get combined. And as I mentioned that this grows at a much higher speed because the base is low. And as we are progressing in terms of providing these services, strengthening go-to-market, so obviously, you will see this revenue going up.\nJohn Karidis: Okay. Thank you. Just sorry, as a last question, I appreciate I have tested my luck here. The refinery in Nigeria, do you think that it has scope, sooner, rather than later, to help with the diesel prices. Do you feel as someone, as people on the ground that this is beginning to have an impact there?\nJaideep Paul: This is the hope we have that with this refinery, we will see some benefits, and we have reasons to, at this point in time, to say that the current stabilization of this refinery surely would have contributed. And we remain hopeful that as this refinery starts to increase production, there should be some benefit that should happen to the overall diesel prices in Nigeria, but very difficult to say whichever will it go, at this point in time we remember.\nJohn Karidis: Thank you all for everything.\nSunil Taldar: Also just to mention that if this refinery starts really producing fuel, it also will help the economy to conserve dollar and therefore the impact, or the impact and devaluation should start looking coming down.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to hand back over to Sunil Taldar for any closing remarks.\nSunil Taldar: So, if there are no more questions, I would like to thank you for joining the call today. Thank you once again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sunil Taldar. Please go ahead, sir.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you. Hello, everyone and thank you all for joining us today. I have with me, Jaideep, our Group CFO; Kamal Dua, our Deputy CFO; and Alastair, who is Head of Investor Relations. Let me give you some brief highlights over the last 6 months before running through our Refresh strategy, which has been deployed across the organization and provide some context to the markets we operate in, and why we are so excited about the opportunity that is in offer across the continent. After that, I will hand over to Jaideep to run through the financials. Despite the volatile economic and operating environment over the last 6 months, we have seen very resilient demand continue to support a strong, constant currency revenue performance. Providing an attractive customer proposition at an affordable level is key to knocking this demand and we see this continuing to support revenue momentum. Over the period, we launched a cost optimization initiative to drive efficiencies across the business. We have already seen pleasing results, which is evident in the recovery of EBITDA margins in the last quarter, retaining our position as an industry leader in terms of operating efficiencies. During the quarter, we have also implemented our Refresh strategy, which significantly increases our focus on delivering best-in-class experience to our customers. And I’ll talk about this later in the presentation. Importantly, without continued investments into our network, we would not be able to provide these essential and affordable services to our customers. It is this sustained investment that is underpinned by our strong capital structure, which has been considerably dearest over the last few years, enabling us to not only continue investing for growth, but also create value for all of our stakeholders. Our purpose is to transform lives across Africa by bridging the digital divide and driving higher financial inclusion. Through the continued rollout of our mobile money services, over the year, we have seen smartphone penetration rise by over 5% and a 13% increase in mobile money customers reflecting the delivery against this corporate purpose. Being a business that is resistant to challenging operating environment has ensured that we continue to capture the growth opportunity available to us. Over the last 5 years, we have consistently reported double-digit constant currency growth, with revenues and EBITDA growing by a CAGR of 19% and 22% respectively. Earlier this year, we launched a comprehensive cost efficiency program targeting structural, ongoing efficiencies will not impact our growth ambitions. We’ve already realized some benefits in this quarter, with a sequential increase in our quarter two margins and we remain optimistic on our ability to realize further efficiencies. Over the year, we have continued investing in capacity and coverage and deployed over 2,800 new sites and an additional 3,500 kilometers of fiber, reflecting our sustained confidence in the future market opportunity. In addition, we have materially reduced our exposure to dollar debt with 89% of OpCo market debt based in local currency, which is up from 71% a year ago. The overall performance across the group has enabled the broad – the Board to reiterate its existing dividend policy with a further 9% increase in our final dividend. Let me now spend a few minutes explaining the significant opportunities across our markets and how our Refresh strategy will enable us to continue executing on this opportunity. As I’ve highlighted previously, I’ve traveled across extensively to our OpCos to understand the opportunity and to get to know our teams across the regions. The one thing that these travels have confirmed is the scale and size of the opportunity across our footprint. From a high level, we have an adult population of 384 million people, which is expected to increase by another 75 million by 2030. Furthermore, we have a unique ability to also offer financial services to our customer base, driving increased financial inclusion. As many of you are aware, from 90% of all transactions in Africa are in cash. And our unique distribution network will enable us to capture a significant share of transaction that innovatively will move to digital platforms. However, the opportunity is not only in consumer, the B2B or enterprise segment offers a particularly encouraging avenue for growth and we are actively working on capturing this demand as digital task, digital infrastructure across the continent evolves. Now to execute against this exciting opportunity, we have refresh our strategy to highlight how we intend to maximize a right to win across the continent. The primary focus of this Refresh strategy is to ensure a great customer experience. By embedding this in our mindset and our day-to-day operations, I believe we can truly differentiate ourselves from our competitors. To unlock this central premise, we have reviewed the pillars that will support this ambition. Firstly, we need to strengthen our go-to-market, enabling us to reach those previously may have been unconnected. Furthermore, it’s about investing in building capabilities so we can up-sell to our existing customers to enhance lifetime value of our customers. Secondly, a brilliant network experience is fundamental to ensuring our customers remain connected, and in many cases, can access a network for the first time, as we continue to invest in network capacity and coverage across our footprint. There are clusters of opportunities which have been identified using digital tools across all OpCos, which have been called out as must-win markets. Through micro marketing efforts, our teams are engaged in making sure that we win in these must-win markets. In the fourth pillar, we focus on the importance of digitizing and simplifying our product offerings to provide simplified customer journeys. As we continue to migrate towards the digital age, the importance of simplifying the customer journey will be increasingly important to accelerate customer acquisition and also improve our customer retention. Airtel Money remains a fundamental part of our strategy and is key to our ambitious success across the footprint. Accelerating the adoption of Airtel Money not only improves our customer proposition, but also has the additional benefit of driving improved financial inclusion. I will talk about the Airtel Money strategy in a bit more depth later on. And finally, our sixth pillar reflects the significance of the adjacent sectors across our markets, which remain untucked. In the absence of fixed line infrastructure, the home broadband opportunity remains significant and we have a real opportunity to scale that business into a meaningful standalone business segment. Our infrastructure across the continent also provides us with unique opportunity to offer a fully integrated suite of offerings or solutions to our enterprise customers or segment. Underpinning the strategy is a relentless focus on cost optimization to support our ambition for growth and continued investments into people and talent across the region. Our sustainability strategy remains a key support for our purpose of transforming lives and acting as a responsible business. I hope this brief summary helps frame our Refresh strategy. And now, let me spend a few minutes explaining the telecoms opportunity and how our strategy fits it. We are exposed to markets with some of the strongest population growth rates in the world as well as some of the most youthful populations. This, however, needs to be combined with a very low level of SIM penetration across our markets and smartphone penetration to understand the scale and size of the opportunity available. As these charts depict, unique SIM penetration remains below 50%, while only around 43% of our subscribers actually uses smartphone, which highlights the opportunity we have to see sustained growth in our customer base both in voice as well as in data. Slide 9 highlights how we will look to strengthen our go-to-market, enabling us to capture this opportunity. Investing into our distribution network will increase the touch points we have between our agents and our existing new customers. This alongside micro-marketing efforts and the simplification of our product offerings will differentiate the customer proposition. We have seen our voice revenue growing at almost 10% in constant currency, which is indicative of the scale of demand for even the most basic services across Africa. This, combined with unique – with continued increases in smartphone penetration, provides the foundation of continued strong revenue growth coming. For customers using voice services for the first time, the likely next step on their telecom journey is to take on data services. Data is undoubtedly an area which has a huge growth potential. We have discussed the low level of smartphone penetration, but even for those that are using a smartphone level of usage is still very low, below global levels. This has to be taken into context of the market environment, where fixed line infrastructure is essentially non-existent. So, the mobile data network is often the only way for customers to be connected to the internet. Slide 11 runs into how a strategy of providing a building network experience is fundamental to unlocking this data opportunity. The provision of a reliable and affordable data connection is extremely important to provide a great customer experience and support customers’ migration from voice to data services. Building capacity into our network and increasing the reach of our 4G network has provided the resilience necessary to become the operator of choice across our markets. Almost, 97% of our sites are on 4G and we have rolled out an additional 3,500 kilometers of fiber over the last year, which is key to unlocking this data growth potential. Importantly, other aspects of our strategy will help through micro-marketing actions of improving indoor coverage and increased network quality we expect a further improvement in providing a seamless user experience. Let me now briefly highlight the opportunity in the home broadband segment and why this opportunity remains very, very compelling. Research shows that households with broadband connectivity across Africa, remains extremely low on our footprint. As a result, the opportunity to offer home broadband solutions across our markets is substantial, utilizing our continued rollout of 5G network across a number of our markets. With data usage of our existing home broadband customers, amounting to 39 GB per month, combined with the ARPUs at a significant premium to our existing ARPU, we are excited by the scale of this opportunity over the medium-term. In addition to the telecoms growth opportunity, we are in a unique position to layer on additional growth in the form of mobile money to further enhance shareholder value. Let me spend a few minutes running through the opportunity and our approach to capturing this opportunity of mobile money. This slide reflects our mobile money strategy, which continues to underpin the strong performance across the mobile money business. Building on what we have discussed earlier, the first priority is to access to the customer base by building distribution and bridging – and bringing our services closer to the customer. This distribution focus, combined with a strong brand, will ensure a focus acquisition strategy to capture quality customers. Fundamental to future success is to build the products and offer across this ecosystem, we will rollout targeted services across the merchant network and drive the enterprise engagement by offering reliable and accessible services. We will also continue to innovate to drive increased use cases and ensure we provide the best customer service and drive increased digital adoption to ensure ease of access for our customer base. These services remain underpinned by a reliable and scalable IT platform, with a relentless focus on a strong compliance and regulatory framework, which across our markets and products is fundamental to the success of mobile money strategy. Mobile money services is all about driving increased financial inclusion across our markets. Low level of financial inclusion has been one key reason for strong customer based growth, but it has also been reinforced by the trust that has been built up – has been built up through the provisions of easy to use services with a focus on float availability, so customers can access their cash with relative fees as and when they need it. The facilitators of these transactions is our agent network, and once again, this has been and will continue to remain our core part of a strategy to drive increased base growth. We’ve seen a significant step up in our agent infrastructure and continue to prioritize the exclusive agent network as a key facilitator of this growth potential. Slide 15 demonstrates the continuing evolution of our mobile money ecosystem with annualized transaction value of $128 billion in reported currency. We’ve seen the makeup of transactions shift towards newer, more advanced services such as bill pay and merchant services as the ecosystem continues to grow. We are still seeing the digital wallet cash-in and cash-out services as the major source of mobile money revenue and there is still huge growth opportunity for this from increasing our penetration with new customers, but there is also continuing diversification of the business towards additional payment solutions and also more sophisticated financial services. Moving on to the enterprise opportunity, the growth of the enterprise segment and a scale of the SME sector provides a unique opportunity for us to tailor our services towards the ever evolving needs of enterprise segments. The recent activation of 2Africa submarine cable, which combined with over 77,000 plus kilometer fiber footprint across the continent, enables us to offer reliable, resilient capacity to our existing corporate customers, while also attracting new customers to offer a unique service at scale across the continent. Rising internet penetration, the rapid adoption of cloud computing and soaring demand for digital services will underpin our data center strategy. We have commenced the construction of data centers in Lagos in Nigeria, with another data center expected in Kenya. We will leverage our relationship with Nxtra business in India to draw on its considerable expertise and relationship with hyperscale players who will be looking to expand across African continent. Hopefully, that provides a snapshot of where we as a business are across Africa and reason for our optimism for the outlook. Importantly, we believe our Refresh strategy will be key to unlock the significant opportunities on offer. Let me now hand over to Jaideep to run through the financials.\nJaideep Paul: Thank you, Sunil and good afternoon to all of you. Let me start with the key financial highlights. Our reported performance continues to be negatively impacted by significant currency devaluation across key markets, most significantly in Nigeria, as well as macroeconomic challenges. However, we have delivered good underlying results despite these headwinds. Revenue growth for the half year was approximately 20% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in data and mobile money services. EBITDA grew by 13.5% in constant currency to reach $1.1 billion in reported currency. EBITDA margin at 45.8% decline from last year reflecting the impact of lower contribution of Nigeria post the naira devaluation and inflationary cost pressure. However, on a sequential quarter basis, margin improved by 124 basis points to 46.5% in constant currency, following the cost optimization program initiated earlier this year. Operating free cash flow at $771 million declined 22% in reported currency due to currency devaluation, as mentioned earlier, especially in Nigeria. And during the quarter, we had extended our tower lease agreement with ATC in 4 OpCos, which resulted in an increase in lease liability of $1.2 billion thereby increasing the leverage by 0.6x. Hence, the leverage during the quarter was at 2.3x as compared to 1.6x in June ‘24 and 1.3x over the last year. We’ll talk about this in detail in the coming slides. EPS before exceptional item was 4.9 cents lower from 7 cents last year, impacted by the translation impact of currency devaluation and higher finance charges. And the Board has declared an interim dividend of 2.6 cents per share, which is up by 9%. Coming to mobile services, our mobile customer base grew by over 6% supported by 9% growth in East Africa as well as in Franco Africa. In Nigeria, the customer base growth was flat as it was impacted by barring of customer as we fully complied with the KYC directive issued by the regulator. Data customers at 66 million were up over 10% year-on-year basis. Mobile service ARPU was $2.2 per customer per month, growing by 9.7% compared to the prior period, primarily driven by data ARPU growth. The decline in reported currency ARPU was on account of naira devaluation. Revenue for the period was $2 billion growing 18.4% in constant currency. EBITDA was $0.9 billion grew by 9.9% in constant currency, with an EBITDA margin of 45.1%, declined 347 basis points in constant currency. However, on a sequential quarter basis, margin has improved by 142 basis points. On mobile money performance, customer base at 41.5 million was up over 13% year-on-year. 26.5% of our total customer base uses mobile money services. Transaction value at $64 billion for the half year increased 30% in constant currency. ARPU expanded 11% in constant currency to reach $2 per customer per month as the expansion of mobile money ecosystem continues to drive increased engagement with the various financial services. EBITDA grew by 33% in constant currency to reach $247 million with EBITDA margin at 53%, expanding 167 basis points in constant currency. Coming to the next slide, the overall revenue growth was 19.9% in constant currency, while in reported currency, the revenue declined 9.7%. In constant currency, both data and mobile money services continue to see strong growth of 28% and 29% respectively with voice continuing to see encouraging growth of 9.4%. Reported currency revenue continues to be impacted by significant devaluation during the year impacting the half year revenue by almost $660 million. On the next slide, we show the group EBITDA performance. So EBITDA declined by 16.5% in reported currency to $1.1 billion. However, constant currency EBITDA grew by 13.5%. EBITDA has been adversely impacted by $348 million as a result of currency devaluation. OpEx increased by $271 million, out of which almost 45% was contributed by the network OpEx increase, which reflects the inflationary cost pressure, most notably in the fuel price across key markets, including Nigeria. OpEx increase, coupled with lower contribution of Nigeria, has resulted in decline in EBITDA margin from 49.6% last year to 45.8% in current year. However, as a result of our cost optimization program, we have seen a 124 basis point increase in EBITDA margin in Q2 to 46.5% as compared to 45.3% in Q1 in constant currency. So, coming to the regional performance. So first Nigeria, so let me briefly call out all the key conclusion from our recent performance in Nigeria. Despite the tough macroeconomic condition, we have seen revenue growth in Q2 accelerate to over 38% as we continue to see strong demand across the market. As discussed earlier, we disconnected subscribers during the quarter to align with KYC directive issued by the regulator, but the growth remains strong. Data revenue grew by over 44% in constant currency mainly driven by data ARPU growth over 30%. Data ARPU growth was supported by increase in smartphone penetration and usage. EBITDA margin of 48.4% have been particularly impacted by the 90% increase in diesel price over the last 1 year. However, margin has improved on a sequential basis as the cost efficiencies materializes and operational leverage offsets some part of the inflationary pressure. In East Africa, revenue grew by 21.7% in constant currency, supported by double-digit growth across all three services of voice, data and mobile money. Voice revenue grew by over 10%, data revenue by 26%, and mobile money revenue by over 31%. Despite inflationary pressure on the cost in certain OpCos of East Africa and the rising diesel cost, EBITDA margins remains resilient. Coming to Francophone Africa, revenue grew by 7.1% in constant currency with Q2 growth accelerating to 9% as compared to 5.2% in quarter one. This growth is testament to the initiatives we have put in place to grow the customer base and improve the momentum across the region. Data revenue grew by over 18%. Mobile money revenue grew by over 20%, while voice revenue declined by 1% in constant currency. Voice revenue was largely impacted by the interconnect rate reduction in some of the markets. EBITDA margin at 42.8% declined by 438 basis points, which was driven by the inflationary cost pressure, increase in fixed frequency fees in certain markets. However, on a sequential quarter basis, margin improved by 201 basis points. The next slide is about finance cost. As you can see, the finance cost excluding exceptional item and ForEx and derivative losses increased by $49 million, largely as a result of increased local currency debt in operating entities in line with our strategy to push down debt to the OpCo. Further, the change in debt mix between foreign currency and local currency coupled with the increase in the interest rate also impacted the finance cost. This increased local currency debt are however mitigating our exposure to exchange rate fluctuation by reducing the ForEx exposures. Exceptional item loss due to naira devaluation was lowered by $240 million as compared to the prior period. Further, non-exceptional derivative and foreign exchange losses in current period, was lowered by $154 million as compared to the last year. Next slide on EPS, despite our good underlying performance with double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA in constant currency terms, EPS has been negatively impacted by derivative and foreign exchange loss primarily in Nigeria. Over and above the derivative and ForEx loss related to the revaluation of USD liabilities and derivatives, currency devaluation also has a translation impact on reported revenue and EBITDA. Hence, EPS before exceptional item at 4.9 cents was lower as compared to 7 cents last year. Our normalized free cash flow despite significant currency and macroeconomic headwind, we are able to generate positive cash flow excluding license renewal payment. This slide gives a bridge between EBITDA and normalized free cash flow. The components of the cash flows include cash CapEx of $418 million, income tax payment of $200 million, license renewal payment of about $91 million, and other cash payment like interest, lease repayment and dividend to various shareholders, minority shareholders. Our capital allocation policy remains the same. Our key priority remains to continuously invest in business along with further strengthening the balance sheet. Our CapEx guidance for current year is between $725 million to $750 million. Our leverage at 2.3x was impacted by ATC contract renewal as well as devaluation impact on EBITDA. We have taken a significant step in reducing our exposure in foreign currency market debt with $809 million payment of foreign currency debt in the last year, including the repayment of $550 million bond in May 2024. Returning cash to shareholders through our progressive dividend policy remains one of the priorities and the Board has already recommended an interim dividend of 2.6 cents per share, reflecting growth of 9% in line with our currency devaluation policy – in line with our current dividend policy. The next slide, we have added this slide in this time since there are – there is a ATC contract renewal which has an impact in the lease obligation. So on September 30, we have renewed our contract with ATC for a period of 12 years on approximately 7,100 sites in 4 OpCos, namely, Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Niger. The 12-year extension period is part of commercial agreement with ATC. The longer term contract renewal is a win-win for both parties as it provides certainty of cash flows for the tower co and enables us to secure strong commercial terms in relation to the commitment ATC has made for investment into renewable energy solution which will result in reduction in consumption of diesel and corresponding cost. The benefit of renewable solution will come in the medium term. The impact of renewals on the cash flow of the company is neutral to positive. The accounting of renewals in accordance with IFRS 16 has been explained on the chart. In the left side that where you can see that the lease rental payment to the tower company remains same over the contract period. Though from the accounting point of view, there is a reallocation of lease rental between interest and principal repayment during various stages of the contract. During the initial period, the interest component is high and the principal repayment is low, which reverses over the later part of the contract. So in summary, the financial impact is cash flow of the company does not change, increase in right of use asset and lease liability by $1.2 billion, which is the present value of the future lease payment, which has resulted in increase in leverage by 0.6x, decrease in profit after tax by approximately $120 million to $130 million on an annualized basis in the very first year of the renewal, primarily due to increase in the interest cost without any corresponding impact incremental impact in the cash flow. 50% of this impact is expected in the second half of the current year. As we progress through the years, this impact will keep coming down in the – and from the middle of the contract onwards mid-term contract onwards, actually the impact will be significantly low. Our next slide on net debt, we continue to focus on localization of debt through de-dollarization program. As on September 30, 2024, 89% of the OpCo market debt is in local currency compared to 71% in prior period. We have repaid $550 million bond that matured in May ‘24 using the cash available at HoldCo. HoldCo is now absolutely debt free. The total weighted average interest rate was 13.2% vis-à-vis 8.8% in the prior period. Increase of this is due to higher local currency debt and repayment of $550 million bond at HoldCo level, which carried a lower than average interest rate. On leverage, we have already discussed the impact due to ATC contract renewal and impact of lower reported currency EBITDA on account of currency devaluation. As a result, the leverage at 2.3x was higher as compared to 1.3x of last year. If we take this entire contract on an operating lease method, the ratio of net debt excluding lease liability to EBITDA after the lease payment, the operating leverage will be 1x for the current period compared to 0.7x in September 2023. Let me now hand over back to Sunil for his concluding remarks.\nSunil Taldar: Thanks, Jaideep. Finally, on Slide 33 just a few words on summary and outlook. As you have seen from our results, our strategic focus has consistently driven positive momentum across the business. Key to delivering value to our stakeholders is to drive continued growth across our base. Our focus will remain on investing in our network and on further expanding our distribution to be closer to our customers, while at the same time looking at new opportunities for growth, particularly in data centers and fiber. Clearly, our results have been impacted by significant foreign exchange headwinds over the last 18 months, but the growth opportunity that exists across our markets remains very compelling and we are well positioned to deliver against this opportunity. We will continue to focus on margin improvements following the launch of our cost optimization initiatives earlier in the year. And with that, I would like to thank you all once again for your attention today. And we would now like to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have is from Rohit Modi of Citi. Please go ahead.\nRohit Modi: Thank you for taking my questions. I have three. Firstly, on the ATC contract, if you can confirm the terms of the contract, I understand the cash flow remains same, but the terms of the contract have changed, particularly talking about USD component and Nigeria and Uganda and Kenya basically, where you have – you are seeing higher FX volatility. Is there any change in terms of your FX component on this contract? Secondly, on your capital allocation within geography, I have seen Nigeria you have invested much lesser in Nigeria in first half compared to last year and much higher in East Africa. So is there any change in terms of your priorities or any reason for lower CapEx in Nigeria or is that just a phasing that you will phase out next half? Third question on again on tower renewals, if you can confirm number of towers that are due for renewal now in near-term on the rest of the footprint? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Okay. So first on the ATC contract, the absolute dollar component doesn’t change. It remains same. The absolute dollar component what was there earlier that remains same. On the second question, if I understand correctly whether CapEx reallocation we are looking at, the answer is at this moment, the CapEx allocation is based on the need of the business and the growth opportunity. We continue to do that including Nigeria. Nigeria also we are rolling out new sites, so that continues. On the third question on number of towers which is coming for renewal in this year second half, there will be about 1,100 towers coming up for Zambia renewal. Next year, roughly between 400 to 500 towers will be coming up for renewal and FY ‘27 another 1,200 towers will be coming up for renewal. So that’s the visibility which we have as of now, 1,100 in the second half of this year, 400 next year and 1,200 in FY ‘27.\nOperator: Rohit, does that answer all your questions?\nRohit Modi: Yes. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is from Maurice Patrick of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMaurice Patrick: Yes, thank you. Yes, from my side just a few fairly simple ones. The first question is on spectrum and I was curious if you could just articulate which auctions or allocations or renewal of spectrum that you have visibility on over the next 12 to 18 months? That’s the first question.\nSunil Talder: Alright. So, spectrum is based on the availability and affordability. So we will continue to look forward as it stands today immediately, we are – there is no auction which has come up, but we will continue to look at the spectrum availability and our affordability and keep buying spectrum, especially on the 4G and 5G rollout and that will continue. Not much of renewal, which is falling due in this year or next year, but in subsequent year FY ‘27 Nigeria, there is a spectrum renewal which will be falling due in the 900 megahertz. So that is in FY ‘27.\nMaurice Patrick: Great. Thank you. That’s the first one. Second question, in your prepared remarks, you talked about wanting to catch some of the growth in the data center market, which you highlighted a $7 billion opportunity by 2028, just curious as to what your strategy is to actually capture some of that growth? Thank you.\nSunil Talder: We see data center as an exciting opportunity in Africa in the years to come. And what we’ve done is we’ve currently invested in and we’ve announced 2 data centers. One is in Nigeria, Lagos, which is what I spoke about and another that data center that we are talking about is in Kenya in the short term. The construction normally takes about 24 to 30 months. So obviously we have to start now in terms of buying the land, which we have done. Second part is designing of the data center which is very critical post that construction starts. While the revenue from the data center will kick in from FY ‘26 onwards, but the investment has to start now. Additionally, what we are also doing is we have cable landing stations in a number of countries like Tanzania, Kenya, Gabon, DRC, these are also additional care opportunities. And we are constantly evaluating opportunities in this space. As I said there are two data centers we’ve already kind of signed off, one is in Nigeria, another is in Kenya. And we are constantly exploring opportunities on other data centers. Nigeria and Kenya is where we expect most of the demand to be centered in.\nMaurice Patrick: Okay, that’s clear. Thank you. And just the last question from me, you have spoken about how you’ve been reallocating debt from the whole company to the OpCos, which comes with a higher interest rate, I believe in terms of having that local debt. But I think you’ve spoken in the past about a tax efficiency. Can you give some clarity in terms of how we should think about modeling cash tax going forward in the coming years, post the reallocation of HoldCo debt? Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: Okay. So if we have a data at HoldCo level and since we do not have any major income at a HoldCo level, we don’t get the tax benefit which is on an average you can take 30%, 31% as a corporate tax – average of corporate tax. We don’t get that benefit. But when we take loan in OpCo and OpCo has a income or revenues. Therefore, we get a 30% – roughly about 30% tax shield on the entire interest charge. So in a very simple math, if you look at it, if the interest cost interest is coming at 20% for let’s say in a particular country and 30% is the corporate tax rate. So effectively, my effective interest post-tax comes down to almost 13%, 14%. So, that’s the way we look at it. The benefit is higher if we have a local currency debt and the local currency and therefore the interest which is charged into the local P&L. In addition to that, we also get the benefit. We are protected from any devaluation impact. And we have seen how the devaluation can impact and how severe it is in certain countries, especially in Nigeria and some of the large operating unit we are. At least from that perspective we are well protected. If devaluation happens, this debt will have zero impact in the ForEx and derivative loss.\nMaurice Patrick: Yes, it makes sense. Thanks so much and thank you for your answers.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Cesar Tiron of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCesar Tiron: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the call and the opportunity to ask questions. I have three, if that’s okay. The first one I wanted to check if you could explain a bit more the acceleration of the service revenue growth in Nigeria? That’s the first one. The second one, I wanted to check if you could explain what needs to happen in your view in Nigeria for the mobile money business to be more successful to be a – to account for a greater share of your of your service revenue? And then the third one, sorry, it’s all about Nigeria. But the third one would be on pricing. I think we’ve been discussing with regulators now for quite some time as an industry to ask for price hikes in light of the high inflation that we’ve seen in Nigeria. Do you think that will prove to be successful? Is there any update that you can give us? Thank you so much.\nSunil Talder: Thank you very much for that question. Let me first start with acceleration in our revenue growth in Nigeria. See, Nigeria is a very, very large opportunity. We’ve always been saying this. Our revenue growth of 36% in constant currency in the first half is largely driven by continued strength in the demand for data services across the country. Voice revenue growth was 23% and data at 44% for the first year. We are seeing – on the price increase front, we continue to engage with the NCC and with other institutions in Nigeria to seek price increase and this is something that we have been added for some time. And our attempt is to at least cover the inflation. Let me provide, apart from the price increase, a little more color to our growth in Nigeria. See the growth in Nigeria has been driven by very largely – is upgrade from as customers upgrade from feature phone to smartphone and that drives the data consumption and that drives the incremental ARPU and the revenue growth. And what we have been doing is we’ve been focusing our attention on higher end customers and focusing on the upgradation of feature phones to smartphones over the period, which is clearly evident in the improvement of our data revenue growth. In addition, we have also been prioritizing the opportunity for home broadband and this is something that we have called out last quarter as well, which is a large opportunity for us within the Nigerian market. We are encouraged with the growth we are achieving in Nigeria and we will continue to invest in order to sustain our growth markets in Nigeria. Having said that, acquiring new customers and low SIM penetration remains a very, very large opportunity, continues to remain our large opportunity in Nigeria. And we continue to invest in our network and most importantly on our distribution to acquire new customers. So acquisition of new customers, while it is currently not reflecting reflected in the base growth, because we had to bar a large number of customers in the – during the quarter to follow the regulation, as announced by the regulator. But we continue to remain focused on driving base growth. We continue to remain focused on upgrading customers from 2G to 4G and that drives data growth, high value customers and then finally home broadband and B2B are the opportunities that we are chasing on Nigeria. Now coming on our PSB business, which is the mobile money business in Nigeria, we’ve started seeing revenue exploration, wherein H1 ‘25 revenue grew by 367% YoY basis, while reported revenue have just doubled due to impact of naira devaluation. However, our priority remains to acquire decent customer base before we start monetizing them. Even on mobile money side, you would have seen our customer base has not grown because we had to follow the regulation and discontinue certain customers as per the regulation. Hence we continue to focus on expanding customer base and keep on building the very wide ecosystem required for monetization. I think it will take us a few more quarters for us to get to a decent customer base as well as revenue following the same. I am confident we are on the right path with the key action that we are driving. In terms of metrics, we have 1.4 million active customers representing 30-day revenue earning customers. In terms of agent network, which is our go-to-market, it’s a strong agent network of about 231,000 agents at the end of September. We have launched certain propositions, which is super bonus. Our cash back campaign that is being used for customer acquisition. And what we are now focused on is building our digital capabilities to offer more use cases to our customers, so that they can do almost all their transactions on our platform and that drives the growth of mobile money in Nigeria, because it’s also very world market, banking penetration is high and use of app is high. That’s really our plan and we remain confident that in the next few quarters, we should – as we build capabilities, we will continue to see improvement in our mobile money performance in Nigeria.\nCesar Tiron: Thank you so much. Can I please ask about the prices as well – the price hikes in Nigeria?\nSunil Talder: Yes. So, price hike in Nigeria, we continue to engage with the authorities in Nigeria. I’m seeking for a price increase to at least cover inflation. The ground situation in Nigeria remains – given the inflation and the ground situation remains very, very tight. We have not heard anything else other than the update that I just gave you to say that we remain engaged. The authorities have been apprised of the challenges that the industry is facing and it is an industry-wide effort which is currently happening in Nigeria. And as soon as we have an update, we will surely share. But this is update on pricing is what we have similar to last time. Having said that, the pricing is not the only area of driving growth in Nigeria, despite inflation, despite the pricing challenges that we have the industry and our performance continues very strongly. We have delivered a 38% growth in the second quarter. And what we intend to do is we continue to remain ahead of inflation and at least cover the nominal GDP growth, which currently the business continues to track. And we will continue to make investments in Nigeria, because we see a large opportunity in Nigeria. Soon as we have any update on pricing, we will update all of you as well.\nCesar Tiron: Thank you so much. That was very helpful.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Jonathan Kennedy-Good of Prescient Securities. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the opportunity. Couple of questions from me just on Nigeria, the CapEx numbers you have put in the ground in the first six months, and the CapEx intensity is up even though the dollar nominal CapEx is significantly lower. Just wondering, how long you can sustain a lower dollar number in terms of CapEx invested there? When will you run out of kind of network headroom and have to revise CapEx then upward again. And then just I know you obviously can’t comment too much on why your largest competitor has much higher margin compression in Nigeria. I think their margins have reached 32%. Are you taking some of these costs in derivative losses, and that don’t come through EBITDA, I just fail to understand why a bigger competitor has a narrower margin than you in Nigeria? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: First question, so I can start, and see. Sir, why we will not comment on competition and their investments, what we can talk about is our investments. We remain optimistic on growth potential in Nigeria. In order to capture this growth, we require continued investments to ensure that not only our customers benefiting from this level of investment, but that it attracts new customers, which is reflected in our pillar of providing a brilliant network experience. We retain a judicious approach to our CapEx investment strategy in order to maximize revenue growth. What is your other question that you have, it was, if you can just repeat that?\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: Well, I was just wondering whether you were taking – you are taking – are you taking some of the naira impact below the EBITDA line? I just failed to understand how you can preserve margin to this extent relative to competitors?\nJaideep Paul: Well, we don’t know the exact structure of the dollar component and local component in their operating expenditure. So, I can’t comment on that part. But I am – but from our side, we have over the period of time anticipating this devaluation, at least for last, I would say, 24 months. We have been actively working in reducing the dollar component based operating expenditure. So, we have converted most of our OpEx only 8% roughly about 8% to 9% of our OpEx is dollar denominated, rest are all local currency. And this was a conscious call which was taken. And therefore, while you see the finance cost has a severe impact because of the of the finance lease – of the lease liability, as well as some dollar debt which we have taken during that period when dollar was not available. But on the operating cost side, we have taken a position at least for last 24 – at least 2 years, 3 years. We have been consistently reducing our dollar exposure in the operating expenditure. And today it has come down below 10% and that’s why you don’t see that severe impact, except the diesel price impact, which is in local currency, but it is linked to inflation and the drop what you saw in Nigeria margin is because of the diesel price and not because of the ForEx devaluation.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: Thank you. That’s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Madhvendra Singh of HSBC. Please go ahead.\nMadhvendra Singh: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three questions. The first question is on your share buyback program, if you could update on the progress. I know that in the release you mentioned that you have used about $88 million. So, how much headroom do you still have left? And given that your underlying leverage excluding lease is actually quite low, and you are generating quite good cash, so is it – is there a possibility of increasing the overall share buyback program? If you could update on that side, that will be great. The second question is, actually a follow-up on the data revenue growth you reported in Nigeria, so again, very good performance there, acceleration during the quarter. But when I see in the breakdown of the drivers, so there is usage growth and there is customer growth. But if you could talk about how much – if that doesn’t add up to the overall 48% growth, I think 47% growth you reported for the quarter. So, has there been any underlying pricing adjustments you have been doing? So, has the yield also has been improving in the data space, if you could talk about that. And then finally, I was wondering about your power pass through component in the tower cost, that was a big headwind during the previous quarter, and I think sequentially, it has not been a huge headwind, but still that is why your margins are still probably not back to the 49% plus level. I was wondering, given that diesel prices have come off the peak now, I think. Oil prices have come down as well. So, in terms of outlook, do you expect any tailwind in the coming quarters? And if you could give some sensitivities or some quantification of how much benefit we should expect given where the diesel prices are in Nigeria, for example, right now. Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Let me take the first two questions. So, let me start with the first question that you asked on the buyback. See the shareholder returns are very important part of our capital allocation strategy. As you have seen, we have a progressive dividend policy, and we have been increasing our dividend by so called 9% over the last few years. This remains a primary method to return cash to the shareholders. In January ‘23 the Board decided to undertake $100 million buyback, which is now almost close to completion. Now, any further buyback will be considered by the Board considering the future cash position of the company. So, that is the answer to your first question. Coming to the second question that you asked with respect to Nigeria data growth, so I will answer this very simply. If you look at while our overall base growth in Nigeria is kind of flattish at about 0.2%, but we have seen acceleration in the smartphone base growth rate, which has grown by about 15%, 14.8% will be precise. And our ARPU has grown by about 27.9%. Now, if you add up these two that explains a very strong data growth that we are seeing in Nigeria. And this has been, as I have said, has been our focus to drive, has been our focus to on high value customers and make sure that we are upgrading our customers from 2G to 4G and drive consumption. That’s what is leading to ARPU growth, which is high data consumption and upgrades. So, that’s the answer to the second question. And the third question was on\nMadhvendra Singh: The cost for diesel, diesel impact, or will there be the tail wind, or what is the future outlook for…?\nSunil Taldar: See, very difficult to comment on the future outlook for – because if you look at the diesel prices in Nigeria, it had hit about NGN1,500 per liter. And then it is down to about NGN1,100 per liter now. And this is in the current quarter, and it is currently, as I have said, is trending at about NGN1,100. So, where will this diesel price go in the future is very difficult. However, what we have done, from our point of view, we are actually, at this point in time, working very closely with our companies to reduce overall operating cost. Network operating cost, few initiatives is, whether it is moving our sites from off-grid to grid, and that also reduces power consumption, solarization of sites using lithium ion batteries. So, we are drawing everything within our control to address the power cost of the network cost. Diesel, as I have said is, these are market forces, and it remains to be seen how it moves as we move along.\nMadhvendra Singh: I didn’t really ask about the diesel price movement outlook, I rather asked about, if the diesel prices stayed where they are, NGN1,100 what would that mean for the margins?\nSunil Taldar: Yes. So, firstly, the average diesel price NGN1,100, but September again, it moved up, it’s NGN1,226. But yes, if you, let’s say the diesel price remains static, obviously, then network cost per site remains static, and that should need to eventually maybe increase in the EBITDA margin in the future period. But the point is that this is such a volatile and continuous, moving element, it’s very difficult for us to say very firmly how much impact or how much benefit it will give us. But the point is, if it remains static and there is no change in next quarter, obviously that is beneficial for us, because then there is no incremental cost added, at least on the diesel side or the other fuel price in the network cost.\nMadhvendra Singh: Great. And just follow-up on the share buyback that point. What I meant to ask was that given you have solid cash flows, and you have already, let’s say, almost successfully completed the current program. Does your balance sheet and cash flow, in your view, allow for another round or extension of this program? Let’s say another $100 million. Is that something you think from a financial management point of view, the company can withstand rather than, I understand the decision is with the Board, but I am just trying to think from management point of view, do you think that is feasible?\nSunil Taldar: Well, we will not be able to make any comment on that. And the first tranche of $100 million is still not completed, so let it be completed. A couple of million dollars are still pending. So, once that is completed, we will go back to the Board with our recommendation, considering this year and most likely of the next year, because keep in mind that we are also investing in data center and so and so forth. So, there is – next year, there will be a full-fledged work on data center, which will start. And both the data center, I am hoping that both Kenya and Nigeria will go in action. So, we will consider everything, and then go with our recommendation to the Board. And then based on the Board recommendation, we will let you know what is the – whether there is any next lot of buyback program will be launched or not.\nOperator: The next question we have is from John Karidis of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJohn Karidis: Thank you. Thank you for this call. I have got a few. So, just two on mobile money, please. So, the first one is, could you remind me by when you need to have listed the mobile money business? And what would happen if the equity markets are not conducive to a listing? So, what would be sort of plan B as it were? The second, mobile money business – the mobile money question has to do with the profitability of the different sources of revenue. So, if I look at Slide 15, where you give us the revenue mix for mobile money. And if I have at the top of my head the 53.0% EBITDA margin that you reported for the six months, I can sort of understand that cash-in and cash-out is less profitable, but it would be lovely pleased to get some sort of idea of how much less profitable it is. Is it 5 points less? Is it 20 points less? And what are the sort of the relative profitability – the EBITDA margins of the other sources of mobile money revenue, please, versus the 53.0% average. And then lastly, regarding Nigeria, other revenue, I see that its percent growth rate has actually now exceeded that of data, albeit from a lower base. And quite honestly, I don’t really understand what’s in it. So, for example, things like fixed wireless access, is that in data, or is it in other? And if it’s not in other, what drives that growth, please? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: So, on mobile money, on the IPO progress, there is nothing has changed from our previous commentary. In terms of mobile money IPO, we are committed to undertake an IPO of the mobile money business within 4 years of initial minority deal. So, just over about nine months from now, and that timeframe still remains. The groundwork is in progress and we will keep you informed at the appropriate time. But there is nothing more to be shared at this point in time.\nJohn Karidis: Sorry. Sunil, can I ask what happens if that – if the equity market is unhealthy?\nSunil Taldar: Now, this is a – see this, obviously it’s a – I mean it’s a scenario analysis, which we will not be able to do at this moment. But yes, there are the options which are being evaluated. And as we mentioned that it is too early for us to comment on this aspect, that if it doesn’t happen, then what happens, and etcetera, etcetera. But those in appropriate time, maybe as we progress through the year, and if we go closer to quarter four, maybe we will have a better answer for that. And we will definitely update you if there is any change from the current date.\nJohn Karidis: Okay. Thanks.\nJaideep Paul: On your other question on mobile money, with respect to yield, very broadly our yield on cash-out is very similar to the yield that we have on, say, bill payments and merchants. So, that’s one, and that is the reason. And the other thing that happens is, as the use cases proliferate, so as customers start to use more – different use cases and use our mobile money for making bill payments, merchant transactions. One is, frequency goes up and therefore – and that drives overall revenue growth for the mobile money business. But very simply to answer your question, yield for cash-out and for bill payment and merchant are very similar in nature, and that should not be diluted when it comes to margin or overall revenue.\nJohn Karidis: Okay. I am sorry, does yield mean EBITDA margin in this case?\nJaideep Paul: No, this is yield. Yield will see EBITDA margin. Every services, you can’t estimate EBITDA, but what you can estimate is what’s my earning for that service. And let’s say, per transaction, what is my earning and what is my cost, and that’s what we call yield. So, minus so – suppose I earn, let’s say, $0.10, and my cost for providing that service is $0.03, then the yield is $0.07. So, from that perspective, what Sunil has referred as the highest yield in cash-out, because cash-out also has a corresponding payout to the complete agents. So, this is a net yield which we consider. Same way on merchant, merchant, of course there is no payout. So, the net-net basis, the yields are very similar.\nJohn Karidis: Okay. Thank you. And then in terms of Nigeria, other revenue and fixed wireless.\nSunil Taldar: See, fixed wireless currently is, - yes, fixed wireless is what we call fixed wireless is actually the data service which we provide to that mid, small and medium enterprises in Nigeria. So, what we call home broadband that’s in the B2C side, and fixed wireless is in the in the enterprise side, yes. So, that services is getting strengthened. And in the fixed wireless, in some places where we see a commercial benefit, instead of fixed wireless, then we go on a fiberization or fiber route, where the customer experience gets much better.\nJohn Karidis: Okay. Thank you. I see your other revenue in Nigeria was up more than 50% in local currency terms.\nSunil Taldar: Yes.\nJohn Karidis: So, what’s in other then, please? What’s the cause of that?\nSunil Taldar: Yes. So, it has a multiple revenue item. It has a VAS revenue, [indiscernible] revenue, FWL revenue, all these revenues get combined. And as I mentioned that this grows at a much higher speed because the base is low. And as we are progressing in terms of providing these services, strengthening go-to-market, so obviously, you will see this revenue going up.\nJohn Karidis: Okay. Thank you. Just sorry, as a last question, I appreciate I have tested my luck here. The refinery in Nigeria, do you think that it has scope, sooner, rather than later, to help with the diesel prices. Do you feel as someone, as people on the ground that this is beginning to have an impact there?\nJaideep Paul: This is the hope we have that with this refinery, we will see some benefits, and we have reasons to, at this point in time, to say that the current stabilization of this refinery surely would have contributed. And we remain hopeful that as this refinery starts to increase production, there should be some benefit that should happen to the overall diesel prices in Nigeria, but very difficult to say whichever will it go, at this point in time we remember.\nJohn Karidis: Thank you all for everything.\nSunil Taldar: Also just to mention that if this refinery starts really producing fuel, it also will help the economy to conserve dollar and therefore the impact, or the impact and devaluation should start looking coming down.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to hand back over to Sunil Taldar for any closing remarks.\nSunil Taldar: So, if there are no more questions, I would like to thank you for joining the call today. Thank you once again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "fullTranscript": "Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Airtel Africa Q1 ‘25 Results. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this call's being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sunil Taldar. Please go ahead, sir.\nSunil Taldar: Very good afternoon, and good morning to our colleagues joining from the US and very warm welcome, to this call. And thank you for joining us on today's call. For those that may not know me, my name is Sunil Taldar and I've taken over as CEO from the beginning of July. I'm joined on the line by our CFO, Jaideep Paul and Head of Investor relations, Alastair Jones. We will shortly be answering your questions. But first, I would like to provide you with a brief overview of the performance in the first quarter and also give a few initial insights of the business and the opportunity that is available for Airtel Africa to capitalize on. I'm very much looking forward to engaging with you in the future as we report on these ambitions. Over the last year, macroeconomic environment has remained volatile. However, our focus on delivering against our strategy has enabled us to perform well in constant currency terms to reduce the impact that currency devaluation that has had on our reported results. Revenues in quarter one reached to $1.16 billion which was a 90% growth in constant currency terms as the demand for our services in both GSM as well as mobile money remains strong. Given the significant currency headwinds, the reported currency revenues declined by 16.1% over the year. EBITDA margins for quarter one came in at 45.3%, which was driven by -- which is driven lower by predominantly two reasons. The first is inflationary pressures across our markets, particularly in rising diesel prices across many of our markets in particular Nigeria. Nigerian diesel prices are over 70% higher than this time a year ago. And secondly, the mix effect of Nigeria, given the lower contribution coming from our largest offer, which is a higher margin business. Just to give things into perspective here, Nigeria used to be upwards closer to 14% contribution of our total business has come down in early 20s. High margin business has a significant impact on overall margin delivery at a group or a total business level, and that is the impact that we're calling out here. However, it is worth putting this performance into context. Despite all the macro challenges, we have been able to enhance our reputation as one of the cost leaders across the industry. We continue to remain as the cost leaders and the most profitable mobile network operator in Africa. And this has been enabled by leveraging our continued success on cost optimization whilst also retaining our reputation for affordable and reliable services, which has maintained our top-line performance and driven increased operational leverage. Our industry-leading EBITDA margins reflect the very strong execution over the last few years. And it is this in my mind that gives us a huge confidence to take additional steps by further intensifying our efforts to look at further cost reductions to entrench our strong reputation across the industry. We've already seen some benefits from this new initiative or intensification of our efforts on reducing costs or driving efficiencies with the primary focus on network costs, which is the largest cost element in our business and particularly energy costs, which remains a significant portion of our overall cost base. The deployment of renewable energy solutions, intelligent network design, which allows us to optimize our network and renegotiation of contracts provides me with conviction that further cost reduction measures are still available. And we will continue to deliver on this over the year ahead. I also want to take a moment to talk through the positive outlook for further growth opportunities across our markets. In particular, in the fiber, which is the home broadband business and also the enterprise business, datacenter, I see a big opportunity due to increasing internet penetration, rapid adoption of cloud computing, and soaring demand for digital services. I see this as a huge, a big future growth opportunity. The recent activation of two Africa submarine cable, which combined with our 77,000-kilometer fiber footprint across the continent enables us to unlock significant potential for future growth. And we have this opportunity to leverage Airtel Africa's relationship with its corporate clients and to offer reliable resilient capacity to our enterprise segment at a scale across the continent and accelerate our growth on the B2B segment. So, fiber B2B and data center continues -- is a very large future growth opportunity that we'll be focusing on. As we announced earlier this year, we have broken ground in Lagos as we commence the construction of a data center in Nigeria with plans advancing for another significant data center in Kenya. On average, both will be 40 megawatt hyperscale design facilities. As we become increasingly optimistic on the opportunity this business offers. Not only is that offering about tapping the shortfall in capacity, but is also offering high-density, secure and scalable integrated solutions to global hyperscalers government and enterprise segment. We will leverage, as I said, our relationship with an extra business in India to draw on its considerable expertise and relationship with hyperscale players who will be looking to expand across the African continent and also leverage on a relationship with the India business to understand some of the best practices on setting up our go-to-market to service our B2B customers, especially in the large enterprise segment and also in the [Indiscernible] and the small business SME segment. These are just some of the opportunities that reflects my optimism for the year ahead. Let me now briefly run through the performance over the last quarter. Before discussing our performance across the two main reporting segments, I wanted to highlight our performance on a regional basis, including both mobile services and mobile money. In Nigeria, we continue to see strong trends with constant currency growth at over 33% in the period continuing to reflect strong demand across the market despite the challenging macro backdrop. In East Africa, we reported over 22% revenue growth in constant currency. The Francophone region continues to see pressure on consumer spend from inflationary and competitive pressures, impacting growth, which increase 5.2 percentage points in constant currency. Let me begin by focusing on the performance of the mobile services segment. The strong demand for services across our footprint, combined with our attractive consumer focus proposition resulted in an 8.6 percentage growth in our customer base, which combined with ARPU of 7.8% resulted in constant currency revenue growth of over 17%, with Nigeria growing over 33%; East Africa by almost 20%; while Francophone region was up 3.6%. Demand for voice services continues to remain robust. However, data remains a very large and a key opportunity for us. The young and aspiring population across our footprint, combined with our widespread 4G network continues to support a further increase in smartphone penetration by almost 5% over the year. This combined with 25% increase in data usage per customer to 6.2 GB has resulted in strong data revenue growth of 26.4% in currencies. Usage remains however low in a global context, so we expect to see growth remain at an attractive level. The mobile money business continued to see a strong performance with over 28% constant currency revenue growth in the period. Financial inclusion across many of our markets remain low and we see mobile money as a key facilitator of increased adoption of financial services, supporting economic growth and transformation. A 15% growth in customer base and a 29% growth in transaction value to an annualized level of $120 billion reflects the continued enhancements we make to the mobile money ecosystem and continued investments into the distribution network. Particularly, the exclusive channels which clearly differentiates our offerings. Below the EBITDA line, our results for once again impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations with the naira continued to weaken in the quarter. Across the group, currency devaluation resulted in derivative and foreign exchange losses $136 million of which one? $22 million related to the naira devaluation, which has been classified as an exceptional item. EPS before exceptional item, came in at $0.023. A key development during the quarter was the repayment of our Holdco bond of $550 million which matured in May 2024. This is once again a continuation of a strategy to reduce external foreign currency debt. A year ago, 48% of our market debt was in foreign currency, which has now been reduced to only 14% at the end of June. Following the payment of our pay down of almost $830 million of foreign currency debt. I think we've stayed committed on this particular agenda. And today at the Holdco level, we are debt free. Our capital allocation policy remains unchanged. Our priority is to continue to invest in the business to ensure we future-proof our operations for sustained growth. And we therefore reiterate our previous tax guidance of $725 million to $750 million for this financial. In addition, we remain committed to a positive shareholder return policy with the AGM approving our final dividend of full year ‘24 of $0.0357 and the continuation of our $100 million buyback program. Now, a little bit about my personal experiences. I joined the business in middle of October and in the last eight-nine months, I managed to travel to 10 out of our 14 operating countries. And having visited most of our markets since I've joined Airtel, I'm very convinced of Airtel Africa's unique position to capture the opportunities on offer across the continent. Our purpose of transforming lives is clearly being delivered as we continually invest in the markets to enable increased financial and digital inclusion, which is fundamental driving economic prosperity across communities. The first priority for the group is to put the customer first and ensure we offer a great customer experience. To do this, we need to continue to simplify the products on offer and provide best in class network experience at an affordable level. Because delivering great customer experience across all our touch points will be our differentiating factor as compared to competition across our markets. And that remains a big area of focus. And we want to put customer right at the front and center of everything that we do. I expect to see continued migration of customers from feature phones to smartphones and the expansion of our 4G network continuing to deliver sustained growth momentum in the future. Offering additional services to our customers in the form of mobile money will further help our growth ambitions. And this remains a fantastic area of growth potential, which we will continue to tap. I will remain focused on ensuring our investments into both the new and the existing business streams, continues to be in a way that maximizes returns available to all our stakeholders. I do think that execution seem to date across the business provides a foundation for future success. The ability to unlock and deliver on the significant growth potential I've alluded to is possible because of the strong capital structure we currently have in place. The outlook for Airtel Africa is very, very compelling, and I look forward to executing on this and our overall strategic priorities in the coming years. And with that, I would now like to open the line for questions, for which, I'm joined by Jaideep. Operator. I now hand over to you to facilitate the Q&A session, please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. The first question we have is from Cesar Tiron of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCesar Tiron: Yeah. Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the call and the opportunity to ask questions. I have three, if that's okay, but they're very easy. The first one would be on Franco Africa. Can you please explain the key reason for the pressure on margins? Is that also diesel, or was the diesel just explaining the pressure on Nigeria? Second question, can you please elaborate a little bit more on your efficiency program because obviously, your margins are already quite high in most of the markets. So how large could this be? And then the third question would be related to Nigeria, what progress have you made in your discussions with the local authorities related to any potential changes to tariff? Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: Thank you for asking this question. Can I request you to repeat your question number three, please? Nigeria price race?\nCesar Tiron: Yes. So, what progress, if any, have you made in your discussions with the Nigerian authorities relating to a potential change in Paris, increasing prices?\nJaideep Paul: Sure. Thank you very much. So, let me respond to your first question on margins on Francophone. We've seen some pressure on Francophone margins primarily arising out of two or three factors. The first being overall inflation that we are experiencing across our footprint. And that is increasing the pressure on our network cost, and that has resulted in further impact on our vita margins for Francophone. Other than this, something which is very specific to Francophone, in quarter one ‘25, EBITDA was impacted by increase in regulatory charges. In some of our Franco countries, specifically in Gabon by roughly $2 million and math related expenses in one of our large market, which is DRC. And this combined with a relatively overall slowdown in our top line growth has had some impact on the EBITDA margin for Francophone. Moving on to your next question on efficiency program, which is what you're saying that our EBITDA margins are already healthy and we are the cost leaders, that's how I understood your question. What are the fur further opportunities? What we've done is, we've actually intensified our efforts and we very genuinely believe that there are future cost reduction opportunities or opportunities to drive efficiency in our business. As I said, we have intensified our efforts in some of the areas, predominantly in the area of reducing network costs. And within network, it is primarily on reducing fuel costs, which is where we've seen a significant impact of cost increase. And what are some of the actions that we are taking or some of the areas that we've identified, first and foremost is in the area of optimizing our network u utilization and design. The second is as I said, introducing energy-saving initiatives. For example, solarization of sites, using lithium-ion batteries across our network to reduce network costs. And in certain areas, which it is about renegotiations of key contracts. While we do this, we are consciously aware that we do not touch any of our growth spends, so that either our growth or the customer experience is not impacted at all. And the way I see it is given the macro-environmental headwinds and challenges. In the first quarter, we've managed our relatively -- we've managed our cost better. And I have full confidence in our ability to execute better. And I remain fairly confident that from here onwards, as we intensify our efforts and execute the way we execute, and we've demonstrated our execution capabilities in delivering growth ahead of the market I remain confident that we will be able to deliver on our cost efficiency and cost reduction program as well. Moving to your third question on Nigeria price increase. On the price increase front, we continue to engage with NCC and with other authorities in Nigeria to seek price increase and this is something that we've been at it for some time, and our attempt is to at least cover inflation. Having said that, while it is very important for us to continue to engage with the regulator and seek for price increase, but that is not the only effort that we are putting in to remain profitable. In Nigeria, which is a pretty large business, our focus is actually on acquiring customers, making sure that we deliver great customer experience, continue to stay invested in Nigeria through intensifying our network investments, our go-to-market efforts and delivering great customer experience to drive top-line growth. That remains a key area of focus. But having said that, we remain engaged and we are fairly -- we remain engaged with the regulator to get price increase in Nigeria.\nCesar Tiron: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Madhvendra Singh of HSBC. Please go ahead.\nMadhvendra Singh: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Mady Singh from HSBC. So just few short questions from my side. Firstly, just extending on the price hike question in Nigeria. I mean, and I remember [Indiscernible] relying on other levers of growth rather than just price hike. Hello?\nSunil Taldar: You broke up there. Please, can you repeat your question?\nMadhvendra Singh: Yeah. Sure. Just asking on the price hike, point in Nigeria. I remember the previous CEO also talked about other levers of growth rather than just price hike. Do you think you have enough, of those deliveries of growth? So, let's say, we gain the lost revenues in dollar terms, and how quickly you think you can recover, and go back to the previous dollar run-rate of, revenue and EBITDA in in the market. So that's the first one. And then secondly, just also picking up on your progress on the mobile money units IPO plans. If you could share where we are on that process? And how confident you are of meeting the timeline there. And then, finally, on your CapEx plans as well. Because of the currency, devaluations, and you still maintain your overall CapEx plan. Given that you're not really getting the price hike you want, at least not in the short run, do you think it is still fair to keep investing at the same around rate of CapEx? Or would you rather wait out, the period where, you're not getting the price hike and maybe resume investing when you have, certain reversal of the like, let's say, regaining of the, dollar, earning space, especially in Nigeria? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you, Mady, for asking those questions. Let me just, start with addressing your first question, which is on price hike. I will not repeat my answer to say that we continue to engage with the authorities and the regulator to seek a price increase. Having said that, your other question that you're asking on Nigeria is, do we see that Nigeria will continue, is a big growth opportunity. Let me just answer it in two parts. First and foremost, we've demonstrated that Nigeria remains a very, very strong opportunity. And in our growth of 33% across voice data is a strong demand station of the fact that Nigeria remains a very large opportunity. And if we execute right, we acquire our customers ahead of competition. We deliver a great experience to our customers. We will continue to grow our business in Nigeria. So that is that is one. We remain optimistic on the growth potential of Nigeria. Having said that, we retain a very, very judicious approach to our CapEx investment strategy in order to maximize our revenue growth. The capital -- the CapEx investment in Nigeria, we continue to remain optimistic and we will continue to invest to expand our coverage to expand -- to cater to a great, experience to our customers. Because some of the opportunities that we see in Nigeria, they remain what they were. The first is, it is still a very large category penetration opportunity in Nigeria. It's still a very large land grab opportunity that we will continue to go after and for that, wherever we need to expand our network coverage, we will continue to expand our network coverage. The second is Nigeria is a very, very large -- offers us a very large upgrade opportunity. We've seen close to 25% increase in our data consumption in Nigeria. And that is one opportunity that we continue to look at our consumption per customer in Nigeria is about 29% in this quarter, which indicates that it still is a very, very large upgrade opportunity that we will continue to pursue. And for that, if we need to invest behind our capacity sites, we will continue to invest. And so far, whatever that we have seen is our revenue per site continues to grow even after making additional investments. Having said that, these opportunities, which is customer acquisition opportunity, upgrade opportunity from 2G to 3G to 4G that remains. There are two other opportunities, which is what I spoke about at an overall context, remains a very large opportunity in Nigeria, which is our fiber and our home broadband. We have deployed 5G sites in Nigeria, which gives us enough data capacity to go after home broadband business. And that is one action that we've taken and our initial results are very, very positive. Second is, as I said, B2B remains a very large opportunity, and Nigeria is first country where we very recently did our groundbreaking -- ceremony for our first very large, close to 40 kilowatt of data center because we see that this market is absolutely ready and this data center should be operational by FY ‘26. So, we remain committed to Nigeria, and we also at the same time, continue to monitor that our capital investment continues to give us returns. Now coming to the third question on mobile money or IPO, we have made a commitment that we will do an IPO within four years of our first transaction and we remain committed to that promise. We are at this point in time working towards making sure that we meet the deadline and we will share progress as we come closer to the timelines.\nMadhvendra Singh: And just one follow-up. Given the current market condition, do you think that achieving similar level of EBITDA multiple bonds, a potential IPO would be possible? Or do you see some risk to that? Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: Maddi honestly, we'll have to discuss this as we progress. This is at the very initial stage. We are from an organization, from governance compliances, where we want to list those decisions are currently under discussion at various level. So, as we progress further engagement with the bankers once we finalize everything obviously this question will be better answered. At this moment, it will be all guess. So, we would not run like to speculate on that at this moment. But yes, as we progress through the year, probably some during either quarter two or quarter three as we come closer, we'll definitely address this question.\nMadhvendra Singh: That is very helpful. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Rohit Modi of Citi. Please go ahead.\nRohit Modi : Thanks for the opportunity. Some of them have already been answered. Just three from my side. Firstly, I know you don't get the guidance on revenue, but if you can share anything around how you look at the Francophone revenue growth trajectory from here, given that has been a substantial slow down this quarter, do we expect same kind of momentum for rest of the year and Francophone, or you think things might improve from here? Secondly your sales and marketing as a percentage of -- revenue has increased and also seems like has been putting a pressure margin. Is that something that you're investing more to get that kind of revenue growth? And if that's the case, which other markets where you can sales and marketing cost is going up, particularly? Thirdly, you commented around fiber being an opportunity, you can give us any color around do you expect to invest more into fiber in future? And there any specific markets where you see this kind of opportunity shaping up? Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: Thank you, very much for asking those questions. First and foremost, let me address the point that you raised around growth slowdown in Francophone markets. The way I see it is, if you look at Francophone Markets, the underlying, some of the metrics of the business continue to point that our business remains healthy. And the reason why I'm saying this is as follows. The first and foremost, if I look at our base growth, which is a fundamental driver of growth for our business, it remains very healthy at about 10 percentage points plus. So, our base is growing at 10 percentage points. Our data consumption continues to grow at about 23 percentage points in Franco markets. So, if I look at, which is a very key indicator of how our customers are engaged with us. Having said that, despite say some of these underlying metrics, we've seen some slowdown in our growth rates in Francophone markets. This is primarily because of two reasons. First and foremost is Francophone markets are experiencing very high inflation. And what has happened is despite a 10% increase in base growth and roughly about, 23%-24% increase in data consumption, our revenues come down. It is primarily because of our ARPUs come down by about 5% at an overall level, which is which is what is flowing on the growth rate in Franco markets. And this ARPU slowdown is as I said is because of two reasons. First and foremost is the impact of inflation. Some of the Franco markets are our biggest Franco market, which is DRC, is experiencing high levels of inflation, which is resulting into some amount of titrating in consumption, and which is the impact that we are also seeing in some of the other markets. That is one. The second is there is also a market where we are seeing very high competitive activity, which is bringing the ARPUs down. So, this is what is contributing to the slowdown of growth rates in Franco markets. And if I've, the way I see it is, we would have liked for Franco to deliver better growth rates than what we've delivered in the first quarter. Having said that, I remain confident in the Franco market's ability to turn around and deliver better growth rates. And this is this confidence is primarily coming from the point of view of the fact that our underlying metrics. And one of them keeping is our base growth, which remains in double digit, which gives me enough confidence. And that is the reason we continue to stay positive on Franco, and we continue to make required investments in our network and our GTM capabilities so that we continue to acquire customers and continue to give great experience to our customers. So that's your, first question. On the, on the [Indiscernible] side, which is what you're saying is our [Indiscernible] expenses --\nJaideep Paul: So, let me address that. So, our sales and marketing cost has moved up to 12.9% of the revenue as compared to 10.3%. So, the question is why it has gone up. So first, let me address this that, as per IFRS standard, it's more of accounting thing. As per IFRS standard, every year we have to do the evaluation of the life of customer in our network. And accordingly, some of these expenditures are deferred. So, what happened last year to this year, there is a improvement in the life of customer in the system. So earlier, it was, let's say, 12 month. Now it has gone up to 18 month. Therefore, the deferment adjustment has to do every year. Once in a year, we have to do that adjustment. So that adjustment has resulted into, roughly an impact of $10 million and $11 million accounting adjustment while the cash outflow remains same. There is no change in the cash outflow. So, this onetime thing you have seen in quarter one, that impact, and that's why you are seeing the expenditure as a percentage of revenue has gone up. But that then doesn't change. Still, there is a further change in the life of customer in the network, which can only happen when the further improvement of churn happens. And it is a once-a-year activity which we do.\nSunil Taldar: And now let me just very quickly, answer your third question, which is on fiber opportunity. The way I would approach this is a home broadband and enterprise opportunity. And we remain very, very confident on what we've seen. From a home broadband point of view, what we are doing is we are testing we first start with FWA because having invested in 5G capacities, we are today able to service our customers through our FWA CPE, which is Consumer Premises Occupant, and deliver the required speeds and the experience, and the response from the market has been very, very positive. And as the demand grows, wherever we need to deploy fiber, we will deploy fiber. And the second is, from an enterprise point of view, we remain confident that this is one segment, which is very, very large and interactive. And wherever fiber investments are required, will make the requisite fiber investments to service our enterprise customers and meet their data and speed requirements. So, from an opportunity point of view, it's a large opportunity. We are right now investing in our infrastructure and also GTM capabilities to be able to service this demand and this market segment.\nOperator: The next question we have is from John Cyriac of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJohn Cyriac: Thank you, very much. Firstly, Sunil, good luck in your stewardship of Airtel Africa. Secondly, my questions first of all, in Nigeria, three months ago MTN Nigeria, as Chief Executive, said that they are facing in his word’s existential issues. And as part of that, they're also cutting that CapEx very significantly. So, my question is, have you seen any change in competitive intensity and or do you expect a change in competitive intensity given their existential issues? My second question is -- second or three, by the way, mobile money in Nigeria. I know you guys are building the business. At what point do we start putting any numbers in our Excel spreadsheets for revenue in mobile money Nigeria? Is it a quarter away, two years away, and on the wiser? So, anything you can say there would be great. And then thirdly, a question that doesn't have anything to do with the first quarter, but maybe Jaideep would oblige me as we try to get our brains more focused on the mobile money ahead of the IPO. Last time around when you gave us a pie chart of all the different services that contribute to mobile money revenue to remind you things like cash out, mobile recharges, P2P services, can you help us understand the profitability of each of those revenue streams relative to the average mobile money profitability?\nSunil Taldar: Thank you very much for those questions and also your best wishes. Let me first respond to the first question that you asked, which is, the comment that you made on the MTNs existential crisis. I will not comment on that, but let me just try and address the key question that you asked is we have not seen any reduction in competitive intensity in Nigeria be it from MTN or any other operator for that point of view. And therefore, a simple and a straight answer is there is no reduction in competition intensity. Having said that, as far as we are concerned, which is what I was responding to the other question to say, we remain focused on the opportunities that Nigeria has to offer across both our GSM as well as the mobile money business on the GSM and both the categories that are the services that we offer, as I said. There is a massive opportunity for first and foremost is a penetration opportunity. The second is an upgrade opportunity, and this opportunity of penetration, and I will talk about upgrade when I'm talking about mobile money is, what do I mean by upgrade? It means equally attractive when it comes to the mobile money business in Nigeria. Having said that, Nigeria is relatively a more mature markets when it comes to the overall mobile money market. And therefore, right now what we are focused on is making sure that we acquire customers. And we have base of 50 million customers, a large number of those customers are smartphone customers. So therefore, we have a right to win, with these customers. And what we need to do is we need to build a very strong ecosystem and make sure that our platform and our services that we offer are very attractive for our customers. We give them great experience on our platform. And that's what we are focused on. At what point in time, we start to monetizing, these services or this customer base, I think it is it is very difficult for me to put in put a number, which I guess you're expecting here, whether it is one quarter or few years. Very difficult, but our efforts are to say, there is a large opportunity. We have an existing relationship with 50 million plus customers in Nigeria. Of these customers, there is a large number of customers, 4G customers. Therefore, they are the customers. If we engage with them, give them right experience, they will give us an opportunity to serve them not only for cash out or cash in, but across the ecosystem. And that is where our focus right now is in building those capabilities and making sure that our customers remain engaged. And then we will start to help you to put some numbers as you said on an Excel sheet. That I guess is it your first two questions? And the third, I think, was what you pointed out to Jaideep, but I'll hand it over to Jaideep now.\nJaideep Paul: Yeah. So obviously, in the half year, when we come with the with the full presentation, we'll discuss about this in detail, but I give you a snapshot of what is happening. Obviously, cash out still contributes a large part of the revenue as a cash out as a bucket. So, 48% of the revenue comes out of the cash out cash out commission which yield the and the yield for that is roughly about 2%. And if I do the net of cash in commission, then obviously it comes down to approximately 1.2%,1.3%. Because cash in we don't charge anything to the customer. Cash out we do charge to the customer and pay commission to the agent. So, the net, the cash in, cash out, net off will be about 1.2%,1.3% yield. For rest of the transaction, for example, P2P, contributes roughly about 12% of the revenue. There's no cap payout for that. And the yield for P2P is roughly about 0.5%. Yield for bill payment merchant is roughly about 1.8%,1.9%, and there is no cash payout for that. And that contributes roughly about bill pay and, merchant all put together. It contributes about 14% of the revenue. And the recharge commission, because Airtel Money does a significant amount of recharge for the GSM entity, and here, 30% of their revenue comes from the recharge commission. And that yield -- and the yield for that is roughly between 6.5%,7%. So broadly and there are other revenue stream which contributes about 12%,13% of the total revenue, and the yield for that, it varies from bucket-to-bucket, but it's not very significant. But the significant portion is cash out. And over the period if you see that there's a change in the mix, the cash out has started coming down from which used to be about 60% a year and year and a half back, that has started coming down. And the bill pay merchant, that started going up because that and that therefore, you see the growth continues because there is a better yield in the merchant and bill pay ecosystem. So that that's broadly the mix, but we will definitely come back and discuss this in detail, when we come for the half year and we make the presentation to all of you.\nJohn Cyriac: That’s very kind. Thank you both very much.\nOperator: The next question we have is from [Indiscernible] Securities. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask questions. So, my first question is on your lease contract. Could you give us a percentage -- the percentage of sites that would be, renewable next year? I think, in the last financial year, I think you did mention the first quarter that, we do see some potential for contract increases in FY '26. And if you could also indicate if this, related to IHS or ATC, that would be helpful. Second, for the fuel price emphasis in Nigeria, we already saw some impact in the fourth quarter of last year. So, what was the quarter-of-quarter change in fuel prices in the country? And then the last question is on the DRC -- related expenses. If you could indicate what impact that was, if you could quantify it for on the Francophone EBITDA margin. Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: The first question, if I understood -- there was a little problem of on the voice, but if I understood it correctly, you want to know about the renewal of the lease contract in certain countries. Is that correct?\nUnidentified Analyst: Correct, yes.\nJaideep Paul: As we mentioned earlier that next year, there are about between next year and subsequent year there between, let's say 18 to 24 months, or rather, I would say, 12 to 18 months. The lease renewal is due in about four countries, four, five countries. And all these four, five countries are either ATC IHS or [Indiscernible] depending on which country is falling due when. So, a large part of this leases will be coming for renewal in this period. But the terms and condition and what will be the construct of those contract, et cetera, will be known to even us as we currently are engaging with our tower codes. We for contract renewal and obviously, the commercials will be coming out after those negotiations and we'll be better off probably in quarter four of this year to be able to communicate much better in terms of the contract construction and in more detail. Your next question was quarter on quarter fail price increase, fail price in quarter four has gone up to almost 1400 plus naira a liter in Nigeria. I'm specifically talking about Nigeria, which is now in quarter one, we are looking at in the range of 1150 to 1200. Now, as per the contract, our contract obligation, there is one quarter in lag. This impact comes. So, quarter four diesel cost increase, the impact has coming quarter one and quarter one is the average rate, which will be applicable when we get the diesel price bill or diesel bill from the tower core in quarter two, it's a one quarter lag in most of the contract. So, what we are seeing in quarter one the impact which has come in quarter four, and then there is a marginal drop in the price in quarter one, which will come in quarter two. So, if diesel price further doesn't go up in the next few weeks, then we expect to see a stability or a slight reduction probably on the diesel per cost as we go to quarter two. What will happen in quarter three, quarter four, if the price remains at this level, then we don't expect at least the rate increase impact in the OpEx as we go forward. If diesel price is stabilized at, let's say, 1150, 1200. On the MAT, MAT is -- in two countries, the MAT has triggered Minimum Alternate Tax. as you know that in these countries there is a rule or law that if the countries have become tax loss the countries are not tax profitable or tax loss, then minimum alternate tax, which is a percentage of revenue between 2% to 3% of the revenue that comes as a minimum alternate tax, which has to be paid. Unfortunately, minimum alternate tax as per accounting standard is not considered as a tax line item, but it is part of OpEx. Between DRC and Nigeria, this impact has come from January to June, so six months impact, about $5.2 million between these two countries. DRC is roughly about $2 million, and balance is Nigeria. This impact has come in quarter one, and this will continue at about $2 million, $2.5 million per quarter as we go forward between these two countries as it is not expected based on the current trend that these two countries will become or upwards will become tax profitable in this year. So, this will continue for this year. However, when these countries become tax profitable, then the minimum alternate tax will not be coming in the OpEx and then the corporate tax at the applicable corporate tax rate. This will come into in the P&L under the tax line item.\nUnidentified Analyst: That’s very clear. Thank you very much.\nSunil Taldar: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the Q&A session, and I would like to hand back to Sunil for any closing remarks.\nSunil Taldar: All right. If there are no more questions, I would like to thank you all for joining this call. And I look forward to speaking to you again and hopefully meeting with many of you later this year. Thank you once again.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

      "transcript": "Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Airtel Africa Q1 ‘25 Results. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this call's being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sunil Taldar. Please go ahead, sir.\nSunil Taldar: Very good afternoon, and good morning to our colleagues joining from the US and very warm welcome, to this call. And thank you for joining us on today's call. For those that may not know me, my name is Sunil Taldar and I've taken over as CEO from the beginning of July. I'm joined on the line by our CFO, Jaideep Paul and Head of Investor relations, Alastair Jones. We will shortly be answering your questions. But first, I would like to provide you with a brief overview of the performance in the first quarter and also give a few initial insights of the business and the opportunity that is available for Airtel Africa to capitalize on. I'm very much looking forward to engaging with you in the future as we report on these ambitions. Over the last year, macroeconomic environment has remained volatile. However, our focus on delivering against our strategy has enabled us to perform well in constant currency terms to reduce the impact that currency devaluation that has had on our reported results. Revenues in quarter one reached to $1.16 billion which was a 90% growth in constant currency terms as the demand for our services in both GSM as well as mobile money remains strong. Given the significant currency headwinds, the reported currency revenues declined by 16.1% over the year. EBITDA margins for quarter one came in at 45.3%, which was driven by -- which is driven lower by predominantly two reasons. The first is inflationary pressures across our markets, particularly in rising diesel prices across many of our markets in particular Nigeria. Nigerian diesel prices are over 70% higher than this time a year ago. And secondly, the mix effect of Nigeria, given the lower contribution coming from our largest offer, which is a higher margin business. Just to give things into perspective here, Nigeria used to be upwards closer to 14% contribution of our total business has come down in early 20s. High margin business has a significant impact on overall margin delivery at a group or a total business level, and that is the impact that we're calling out here. However, it is worth putting this performance into context. Despite all the macro challenges, we have been able to enhance our reputation as one of the cost leaders across the industry. We continue to remain as the cost leaders and the most profitable mobile network operator in Africa. And this has been enabled by leveraging our continued success on cost optimization whilst also retaining our reputation for affordable and reliable services, which has maintained our top-line performance and driven increased operational leverage. Our industry-leading EBITDA margins reflect the very strong execution over the last few years. And it is this in my mind that gives us a huge confidence to take additional steps by further intensifying our efforts to look at further cost reductions to entrench our strong reputation across the industry. We've already seen some benefits from this new initiative or intensification of our efforts on reducing costs or driving efficiencies with the primary focus on network costs, which is the largest cost element in our business and particularly energy costs, which remains a significant portion of our overall cost base. The deployment of renewable energy solutions, intelligent network design, which allows us to optimize our network and renegotiation of contracts provides me with conviction that further cost reduction measures are still available. And we will continue to deliver on this over the year ahead. I also want to take a moment to talk through the positive outlook for further growth opportunities across our markets. In particular, in the fiber, which is the home broadband business and also the enterprise business, datacenter, I see a big opportunity due to increasing internet penetration, rapid adoption of cloud computing, and soaring demand for digital services. I see this as a huge, a big future growth opportunity. The recent activation of two Africa submarine cable, which combined with our 77,000-kilometer fiber footprint across the continent enables us to unlock significant potential for future growth. And we have this opportunity to leverage Airtel Africa's relationship with its corporate clients and to offer reliable resilient capacity to our enterprise segment at a scale across the continent and accelerate our growth on the B2B segment. So, fiber B2B and data center continues -- is a very large future growth opportunity that we'll be focusing on. As we announced earlier this year, we have broken ground in Lagos as we commence the construction of a data center in Nigeria with plans advancing for another significant data center in Kenya. On average, both will be 40 megawatt hyperscale design facilities. As we become increasingly optimistic on the opportunity this business offers. Not only is that offering about tapping the shortfall in capacity, but is also offering high-density, secure and scalable integrated solutions to global hyperscalers government and enterprise segment. We will leverage, as I said, our relationship with an extra business in India to draw on its considerable expertise and relationship with hyperscale players who will be looking to expand across the African continent and also leverage on a relationship with the India business to understand some of the best practices on setting up our go-to-market to service our B2B customers, especially in the large enterprise segment and also in the [Indiscernible] and the small business SME segment. These are just some of the opportunities that reflects my optimism for the year ahead. Let me now briefly run through the performance over the last quarter. Before discussing our performance across the two main reporting segments, I wanted to highlight our performance on a regional basis, including both mobile services and mobile money. In Nigeria, we continue to see strong trends with constant currency growth at over 33% in the period continuing to reflect strong demand across the market despite the challenging macro backdrop. In East Africa, we reported over 22% revenue growth in constant currency. The Francophone region continues to see pressure on consumer spend from inflationary and competitive pressures, impacting growth, which increase 5.2 percentage points in constant currency. Let me begin by focusing on the performance of the mobile services segment. The strong demand for services across our footprint, combined with our attractive consumer focus proposition resulted in an 8.6 percentage growth in our customer base, which combined with ARPU of 7.8% resulted in constant currency revenue growth of over 17%, with Nigeria growing over 33%; East Africa by almost 20%; while Francophone region was up 3.6%. Demand for voice services continues to remain robust. However, data remains a very large and a key opportunity for us. The young and aspiring population across our footprint, combined with our widespread 4G network continues to support a further increase in smartphone penetration by almost 5% over the year. This combined with 25% increase in data usage per customer to 6.2 GB has resulted in strong data revenue growth of 26.4% in currencies. Usage remains however low in a global context, so we expect to see growth remain at an attractive level. The mobile money business continued to see a strong performance with over 28% constant currency revenue growth in the period. Financial inclusion across many of our markets remain low and we see mobile money as a key facilitator of increased adoption of financial services, supporting economic growth and transformation. A 15% growth in customer base and a 29% growth in transaction value to an annualized level of $120 billion reflects the continued enhancements we make to the mobile money ecosystem and continued investments into the distribution network. Particularly, the exclusive channels which clearly differentiates our offerings. Below the EBITDA line, our results for once again impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations with the naira continued to weaken in the quarter. Across the group, currency devaluation resulted in derivative and foreign exchange losses $136 million of which one? $22 million related to the naira devaluation, which has been classified as an exceptional item. EPS before exceptional item, came in at $0.023. A key development during the quarter was the repayment of our Holdco bond of $550 million which matured in May 2024. This is once again a continuation of a strategy to reduce external foreign currency debt. A year ago, 48% of our market debt was in foreign currency, which has now been reduced to only 14% at the end of June. Following the payment of our pay down of almost $830 million of foreign currency debt. I think we've stayed committed on this particular agenda. And today at the Holdco level, we are debt free. Our capital allocation policy remains unchanged. Our priority is to continue to invest in the business to ensure we future-proof our operations for sustained growth. And we therefore reiterate our previous tax guidance of $725 million to $750 million for this financial. In addition, we remain committed to a positive shareholder return policy with the AGM approving our final dividend of full year ‘24 of $0.0357 and the continuation of our $100 million buyback program. Now, a little bit about my personal experiences. I joined the business in middle of October and in the last eight-nine months, I managed to travel to 10 out of our 14 operating countries. And having visited most of our markets since I've joined Airtel, I'm very convinced of Airtel Africa's unique position to capture the opportunities on offer across the continent. Our purpose of transforming lives is clearly being delivered as we continually invest in the markets to enable increased financial and digital inclusion, which is fundamental driving economic prosperity across communities. The first priority for the group is to put the customer first and ensure we offer a great customer experience. To do this, we need to continue to simplify the products on offer and provide best in class network experience at an affordable level. Because delivering great customer experience across all our touch points will be our differentiating factor as compared to competition across our markets. And that remains a big area of focus. And we want to put customer right at the front and center of everything that we do. I expect to see continued migration of customers from feature phones to smartphones and the expansion of our 4G network continuing to deliver sustained growth momentum in the future. Offering additional services to our customers in the form of mobile money will further help our growth ambitions. And this remains a fantastic area of growth potential, which we will continue to tap. I will remain focused on ensuring our investments into both the new and the existing business streams, continues to be in a way that maximizes returns available to all our stakeholders. I do think that execution seem to date across the business provides a foundation for future success. The ability to unlock and deliver on the significant growth potential I've alluded to is possible because of the strong capital structure we currently have in place. The outlook for Airtel Africa is very, very compelling, and I look forward to executing on this and our overall strategic priorities in the coming years. And with that, I would now like to open the line for questions, for which, I'm joined by Jaideep. Operator. I now hand over to you to facilitate the Q&A session, please.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. The first question we have is from Cesar Tiron of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCesar Tiron: Yeah. Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the call and the opportunity to ask questions. I have three, if that's okay, but they're very easy. The first one would be on Franco Africa. Can you please explain the key reason for the pressure on margins? Is that also diesel, or was the diesel just explaining the pressure on Nigeria? Second question, can you please elaborate a little bit more on your efficiency program because obviously, your margins are already quite high in most of the markets. So how large could this be? And then the third question would be related to Nigeria, what progress have you made in your discussions with the local authorities related to any potential changes to tariff? Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: Thank you for asking this question. Can I request you to repeat your question number three, please? Nigeria price race?\nCesar Tiron: Yes. So, what progress, if any, have you made in your discussions with the Nigerian authorities relating to a potential change in Paris, increasing prices?\nJaideep Paul: Sure. Thank you very much. So, let me respond to your first question on margins on Francophone. We've seen some pressure on Francophone margins primarily arising out of two or three factors. The first being overall inflation that we are experiencing across our footprint. And that is increasing the pressure on our network cost, and that has resulted in further impact on our vita margins for Francophone. Other than this, something which is very specific to Francophone, in quarter one ‘25, EBITDA was impacted by increase in regulatory charges. In some of our Franco countries, specifically in Gabon by roughly $2 million and math related expenses in one of our large market, which is DRC. And this combined with a relatively overall slowdown in our top line growth has had some impact on the EBITDA margin for Francophone. Moving on to your next question on efficiency program, which is what you're saying that our EBITDA margins are already healthy and we are the cost leaders, that's how I understood your question. What are the fur further opportunities? What we've done is, we've actually intensified our efforts and we very genuinely believe that there are future cost reduction opportunities or opportunities to drive efficiency in our business. As I said, we have intensified our efforts in some of the areas, predominantly in the area of reducing network costs. And within network, it is primarily on reducing fuel costs, which is where we've seen a significant impact of cost increase. And what are some of the actions that we are taking or some of the areas that we've identified, first and foremost is in the area of optimizing our network u utilization and design. The second is as I said, introducing energy-saving initiatives. For example, solarization of sites, using lithium-ion batteries across our network to reduce network costs. And in certain areas, which it is about renegotiations of key contracts. While we do this, we are consciously aware that we do not touch any of our growth spends, so that either our growth or the customer experience is not impacted at all. And the way I see it is given the macro-environmental headwinds and challenges. In the first quarter, we've managed our relatively -- we've managed our cost better. And I have full confidence in our ability to execute better. And I remain fairly confident that from here onwards, as we intensify our efforts and execute the way we execute, and we've demonstrated our execution capabilities in delivering growth ahead of the market I remain confident that we will be able to deliver on our cost efficiency and cost reduction program as well. Moving to your third question on Nigeria price increase. On the price increase front, we continue to engage with NCC and with other authorities in Nigeria to seek price increase and this is something that we've been at it for some time, and our attempt is to at least cover inflation. Having said that, while it is very important for us to continue to engage with the regulator and seek for price increase, but that is not the only effort that we are putting in to remain profitable. In Nigeria, which is a pretty large business, our focus is actually on acquiring customers, making sure that we deliver great customer experience, continue to stay invested in Nigeria through intensifying our network investments, our go-to-market efforts and delivering great customer experience to drive top-line growth. That remains a key area of focus. But having said that, we remain engaged and we are fairly -- we remain engaged with the regulator to get price increase in Nigeria.\nCesar Tiron: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Madhvendra Singh of HSBC. Please go ahead.\nMadhvendra Singh: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Mady Singh from HSBC. So just few short questions from my side. Firstly, just extending on the price hike question in Nigeria. I mean, and I remember [Indiscernible] relying on other levers of growth rather than just price hike. Hello?\nSunil Taldar: You broke up there. Please, can you repeat your question?\nMadhvendra Singh: Yeah. Sure. Just asking on the price hike, point in Nigeria. I remember the previous CEO also talked about other levers of growth rather than just price hike. Do you think you have enough, of those deliveries of growth? So, let's say, we gain the lost revenues in dollar terms, and how quickly you think you can recover, and go back to the previous dollar run-rate of, revenue and EBITDA in in the market. So that's the first one. And then secondly, just also picking up on your progress on the mobile money units IPO plans. If you could share where we are on that process? And how confident you are of meeting the timeline there. And then, finally, on your CapEx plans as well. Because of the currency, devaluations, and you still maintain your overall CapEx plan. Given that you're not really getting the price hike you want, at least not in the short run, do you think it is still fair to keep investing at the same around rate of CapEx? Or would you rather wait out, the period where, you're not getting the price hike and maybe resume investing when you have, certain reversal of the like, let's say, regaining of the, dollar, earning space, especially in Nigeria? Thank you.\nSunil Taldar: Thank you, Mady, for asking those questions. Let me just, start with addressing your first question, which is on price hike. I will not repeat my answer to say that we continue to engage with the authorities and the regulator to seek a price increase. Having said that, your other question that you're asking on Nigeria is, do we see that Nigeria will continue, is a big growth opportunity. Let me just answer it in two parts. First and foremost, we've demonstrated that Nigeria remains a very, very strong opportunity. And in our growth of 33% across voice data is a strong demand station of the fact that Nigeria remains a very large opportunity. And if we execute right, we acquire our customers ahead of competition. We deliver a great experience to our customers. We will continue to grow our business in Nigeria. So that is that is one. We remain optimistic on the growth potential of Nigeria. Having said that, we retain a very, very judicious approach to our CapEx investment strategy in order to maximize our revenue growth. The capital -- the CapEx investment in Nigeria, we continue to remain optimistic and we will continue to invest to expand our coverage to expand -- to cater to a great, experience to our customers. Because some of the opportunities that we see in Nigeria, they remain what they were. The first is, it is still a very large category penetration opportunity in Nigeria. It's still a very large land grab opportunity that we will continue to go after and for that, wherever we need to expand our network coverage, we will continue to expand our network coverage. The second is Nigeria is a very, very large -- offers us a very large upgrade opportunity. We've seen close to 25% increase in our data consumption in Nigeria. And that is one opportunity that we continue to look at our consumption per customer in Nigeria is about 29% in this quarter, which indicates that it still is a very, very large upgrade opportunity that we will continue to pursue. And for that, if we need to invest behind our capacity sites, we will continue to invest. And so far, whatever that we have seen is our revenue per site continues to grow even after making additional investments. Having said that, these opportunities, which is customer acquisition opportunity, upgrade opportunity from 2G to 3G to 4G that remains. There are two other opportunities, which is what I spoke about at an overall context, remains a very large opportunity in Nigeria, which is our fiber and our home broadband. We have deployed 5G sites in Nigeria, which gives us enough data capacity to go after home broadband business. And that is one action that we've taken and our initial results are very, very positive. Second is, as I said, B2B remains a very large opportunity, and Nigeria is first country where we very recently did our groundbreaking -- ceremony for our first very large, close to 40 kilowatt of data center because we see that this market is absolutely ready and this data center should be operational by FY ‘26. So, we remain committed to Nigeria, and we also at the same time, continue to monitor that our capital investment continues to give us returns. Now coming to the third question on mobile money or IPO, we have made a commitment that we will do an IPO within four years of our first transaction and we remain committed to that promise. We are at this point in time working towards making sure that we meet the deadline and we will share progress as we come closer to the timelines.\nMadhvendra Singh: And just one follow-up. Given the current market condition, do you think that achieving similar level of EBITDA multiple bonds, a potential IPO would be possible? Or do you see some risk to that? Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: Maddi honestly, we'll have to discuss this as we progress. This is at the very initial stage. We are from an organization, from governance compliances, where we want to list those decisions are currently under discussion at various level. So, as we progress further engagement with the bankers once we finalize everything obviously this question will be better answered. At this moment, it will be all guess. So, we would not run like to speculate on that at this moment. But yes, as we progress through the year, probably some during either quarter two or quarter three as we come closer, we'll definitely address this question.\nMadhvendra Singh: That is very helpful. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Rohit Modi of Citi. Please go ahead.\nRohit Modi : Thanks for the opportunity. Some of them have already been answered. Just three from my side. Firstly, I know you don't get the guidance on revenue, but if you can share anything around how you look at the Francophone revenue growth trajectory from here, given that has been a substantial slow down this quarter, do we expect same kind of momentum for rest of the year and Francophone, or you think things might improve from here? Secondly your sales and marketing as a percentage of -- revenue has increased and also seems like has been putting a pressure margin. Is that something that you're investing more to get that kind of revenue growth? And if that's the case, which other markets where you can sales and marketing cost is going up, particularly? Thirdly, you commented around fiber being an opportunity, you can give us any color around do you expect to invest more into fiber in future? And there any specific markets where you see this kind of opportunity shaping up? Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: Thank you, very much for asking those questions. First and foremost, let me address the point that you raised around growth slowdown in Francophone markets. The way I see it is, if you look at Francophone Markets, the underlying, some of the metrics of the business continue to point that our business remains healthy. And the reason why I'm saying this is as follows. The first and foremost, if I look at our base growth, which is a fundamental driver of growth for our business, it remains very healthy at about 10 percentage points plus. So, our base is growing at 10 percentage points. Our data consumption continues to grow at about 23 percentage points in Franco markets. So, if I look at, which is a very key indicator of how our customers are engaged with us. Having said that, despite say some of these underlying metrics, we've seen some slowdown in our growth rates in Francophone markets. This is primarily because of two reasons. First and foremost is Francophone markets are experiencing very high inflation. And what has happened is despite a 10% increase in base growth and roughly about, 23%-24% increase in data consumption, our revenues come down. It is primarily because of our ARPUs come down by about 5% at an overall level, which is which is what is flowing on the growth rate in Franco markets. And this ARPU slowdown is as I said is because of two reasons. First and foremost is the impact of inflation. Some of the Franco markets are our biggest Franco market, which is DRC, is experiencing high levels of inflation, which is resulting into some amount of titrating in consumption, and which is the impact that we are also seeing in some of the other markets. That is one. The second is there is also a market where we are seeing very high competitive activity, which is bringing the ARPUs down. So, this is what is contributing to the slowdown of growth rates in Franco markets. And if I've, the way I see it is, we would have liked for Franco to deliver better growth rates than what we've delivered in the first quarter. Having said that, I remain confident in the Franco market's ability to turn around and deliver better growth rates. And this is this confidence is primarily coming from the point of view of the fact that our underlying metrics. And one of them keeping is our base growth, which remains in double digit, which gives me enough confidence. And that is the reason we continue to stay positive on Franco, and we continue to make required investments in our network and our GTM capabilities so that we continue to acquire customers and continue to give great experience to our customers. So that's your, first question. On the, on the [Indiscernible] side, which is what you're saying is our [Indiscernible] expenses --\nJaideep Paul: So, let me address that. So, our sales and marketing cost has moved up to 12.9% of the revenue as compared to 10.3%. So, the question is why it has gone up. So first, let me address this that, as per IFRS standard, it's more of accounting thing. As per IFRS standard, every year we have to do the evaluation of the life of customer in our network. And accordingly, some of these expenditures are deferred. So, what happened last year to this year, there is a improvement in the life of customer in the system. So earlier, it was, let's say, 12 month. Now it has gone up to 18 month. Therefore, the deferment adjustment has to do every year. Once in a year, we have to do that adjustment. So that adjustment has resulted into, roughly an impact of $10 million and $11 million accounting adjustment while the cash outflow remains same. There is no change in the cash outflow. So, this onetime thing you have seen in quarter one, that impact, and that's why you are seeing the expenditure as a percentage of revenue has gone up. But that then doesn't change. Still, there is a further change in the life of customer in the network, which can only happen when the further improvement of churn happens. And it is a once-a-year activity which we do.\nSunil Taldar: And now let me just very quickly, answer your third question, which is on fiber opportunity. The way I would approach this is a home broadband and enterprise opportunity. And we remain very, very confident on what we've seen. From a home broadband point of view, what we are doing is we are testing we first start with FWA because having invested in 5G capacities, we are today able to service our customers through our FWA CPE, which is Consumer Premises Occupant, and deliver the required speeds and the experience, and the response from the market has been very, very positive. And as the demand grows, wherever we need to deploy fiber, we will deploy fiber. And the second is, from an enterprise point of view, we remain confident that this is one segment, which is very, very large and interactive. And wherever fiber investments are required, will make the requisite fiber investments to service our enterprise customers and meet their data and speed requirements. So, from an opportunity point of view, it's a large opportunity. We are right now investing in our infrastructure and also GTM capabilities to be able to service this demand and this market segment.\nOperator: The next question we have is from John Cyriac of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJohn Cyriac: Thank you, very much. Firstly, Sunil, good luck in your stewardship of Airtel Africa. Secondly, my questions first of all, in Nigeria, three months ago MTN Nigeria, as Chief Executive, said that they are facing in his word’s existential issues. And as part of that, they're also cutting that CapEx very significantly. So, my question is, have you seen any change in competitive intensity and or do you expect a change in competitive intensity given their existential issues? My second question is -- second or three, by the way, mobile money in Nigeria. I know you guys are building the business. At what point do we start putting any numbers in our Excel spreadsheets for revenue in mobile money Nigeria? Is it a quarter away, two years away, and on the wiser? So, anything you can say there would be great. And then thirdly, a question that doesn't have anything to do with the first quarter, but maybe Jaideep would oblige me as we try to get our brains more focused on the mobile money ahead of the IPO. Last time around when you gave us a pie chart of all the different services that contribute to mobile money revenue to remind you things like cash out, mobile recharges, P2P services, can you help us understand the profitability of each of those revenue streams relative to the average mobile money profitability?\nSunil Taldar: Thank you very much for those questions and also your best wishes. Let me first respond to the first question that you asked, which is, the comment that you made on the MTNs existential crisis. I will not comment on that, but let me just try and address the key question that you asked is we have not seen any reduction in competitive intensity in Nigeria be it from MTN or any other operator for that point of view. And therefore, a simple and a straight answer is there is no reduction in competition intensity. Having said that, as far as we are concerned, which is what I was responding to the other question to say, we remain focused on the opportunities that Nigeria has to offer across both our GSM as well as the mobile money business on the GSM and both the categories that are the services that we offer, as I said. There is a massive opportunity for first and foremost is a penetration opportunity. The second is an upgrade opportunity, and this opportunity of penetration, and I will talk about upgrade when I'm talking about mobile money is, what do I mean by upgrade? It means equally attractive when it comes to the mobile money business in Nigeria. Having said that, Nigeria is relatively a more mature markets when it comes to the overall mobile money market. And therefore, right now what we are focused on is making sure that we acquire customers. And we have base of 50 million customers, a large number of those customers are smartphone customers. So therefore, we have a right to win, with these customers. And what we need to do is we need to build a very strong ecosystem and make sure that our platform and our services that we offer are very attractive for our customers. We give them great experience on our platform. And that's what we are focused on. At what point in time, we start to monetizing, these services or this customer base, I think it is it is very difficult for me to put in put a number, which I guess you're expecting here, whether it is one quarter or few years. Very difficult, but our efforts are to say, there is a large opportunity. We have an existing relationship with 50 million plus customers in Nigeria. Of these customers, there is a large number of customers, 4G customers. Therefore, they are the customers. If we engage with them, give them right experience, they will give us an opportunity to serve them not only for cash out or cash in, but across the ecosystem. And that is where our focus right now is in building those capabilities and making sure that our customers remain engaged. And then we will start to help you to put some numbers as you said on an Excel sheet. That I guess is it your first two questions? And the third, I think, was what you pointed out to Jaideep, but I'll hand it over to Jaideep now.\nJaideep Paul: Yeah. So obviously, in the half year, when we come with the with the full presentation, we'll discuss about this in detail, but I give you a snapshot of what is happening. Obviously, cash out still contributes a large part of the revenue as a cash out as a bucket. So, 48% of the revenue comes out of the cash out cash out commission which yield the and the yield for that is roughly about 2%. And if I do the net of cash in commission, then obviously it comes down to approximately 1.2%,1.3%. Because cash in we don't charge anything to the customer. Cash out we do charge to the customer and pay commission to the agent. So, the net, the cash in, cash out, net off will be about 1.2%,1.3% yield. For rest of the transaction, for example, P2P, contributes roughly about 12% of the revenue. There's no cap payout for that. And the yield for P2P is roughly about 0.5%. Yield for bill payment merchant is roughly about 1.8%,1.9%, and there is no cash payout for that. And that contributes roughly about bill pay and, merchant all put together. It contributes about 14% of the revenue. And the recharge commission, because Airtel Money does a significant amount of recharge for the GSM entity, and here, 30% of their revenue comes from the recharge commission. And that yield -- and the yield for that is roughly between 6.5%,7%. So broadly and there are other revenue stream which contributes about 12%,13% of the total revenue, and the yield for that, it varies from bucket-to-bucket, but it's not very significant. But the significant portion is cash out. And over the period if you see that there's a change in the mix, the cash out has started coming down from which used to be about 60% a year and year and a half back, that has started coming down. And the bill pay merchant, that started going up because that and that therefore, you see the growth continues because there is a better yield in the merchant and bill pay ecosystem. So that that's broadly the mix, but we will definitely come back and discuss this in detail, when we come for the half year and we make the presentation to all of you.\nJohn Cyriac: That’s very kind. Thank you both very much.\nOperator: The next question we have is from [Indiscernible] Securities. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask questions. So, my first question is on your lease contract. Could you give us a percentage -- the percentage of sites that would be, renewable next year? I think, in the last financial year, I think you did mention the first quarter that, we do see some potential for contract increases in FY '26. And if you could also indicate if this, related to IHS or ATC, that would be helpful. Second, for the fuel price emphasis in Nigeria, we already saw some impact in the fourth quarter of last year. So, what was the quarter-of-quarter change in fuel prices in the country? And then the last question is on the DRC -- related expenses. If you could indicate what impact that was, if you could quantify it for on the Francophone EBITDA margin. Thank you.\nJaideep Paul: The first question, if I understood -- there was a little problem of on the voice, but if I understood it correctly, you want to know about the renewal of the lease contract in certain countries. Is that correct?\nUnidentified Analyst: Correct, yes.\nJaideep Paul: As we mentioned earlier that next year, there are about between next year and subsequent year there between, let's say 18 to 24 months, or rather, I would say, 12 to 18 months. The lease renewal is due in about four countries, four, five countries. And all these four, five countries are either ATC IHS or [Indiscernible] depending on which country is falling due when. So, a large part of this leases will be coming for renewal in this period. But the terms and condition and what will be the construct of those contract, et cetera, will be known to even us as we currently are engaging with our tower codes. We for contract renewal and obviously, the commercials will be coming out after those negotiations and we'll be better off probably in quarter four of this year to be able to communicate much better in terms of the contract construction and in more detail. Your next question was quarter on quarter fail price increase, fail price in quarter four has gone up to almost 1400 plus naira a liter in Nigeria. I'm specifically talking about Nigeria, which is now in quarter one, we are looking at in the range of 1150 to 1200. Now, as per the contract, our contract obligation, there is one quarter in lag. This impact comes. So, quarter four diesel cost increase, the impact has coming quarter one and quarter one is the average rate, which will be applicable when we get the diesel price bill or diesel bill from the tower core in quarter two, it's a one quarter lag in most of the contract. So, what we are seeing in quarter one the impact which has come in quarter four, and then there is a marginal drop in the price in quarter one, which will come in quarter two. So, if diesel price further doesn't go up in the next few weeks, then we expect to see a stability or a slight reduction probably on the diesel per cost as we go to quarter two. What will happen in quarter three, quarter four, if the price remains at this level, then we don't expect at least the rate increase impact in the OpEx as we go forward. If diesel price is stabilized at, let's say, 1150, 1200. On the MAT, MAT is -- in two countries, the MAT has triggered Minimum Alternate Tax. as you know that in these countries there is a rule or law that if the countries have become tax loss the countries are not tax profitable or tax loss, then minimum alternate tax, which is a percentage of revenue between 2% to 3% of the revenue that comes as a minimum alternate tax, which has to be paid. Unfortunately, minimum alternate tax as per accounting standard is not considered as a tax line item, but it is part of OpEx. Between DRC and Nigeria, this impact has come from January to June, so six months impact, about $5.2 million between these two countries. DRC is roughly about $2 million, and balance is Nigeria. This impact has come in quarter one, and this will continue at about $2 million, $2.5 million per quarter as we go forward between these two countries as it is not expected based on the current trend that these two countries will become or upwards will become tax profitable in this year. So, this will continue for this year. However, when these countries become tax profitable, then the minimum alternate tax will not be coming in the OpEx and then the corporate tax at the applicable corporate tax rate. This will come into in the P&L under the tax line item.\nUnidentified Analyst: That’s very clear. Thank you very much.\nSunil Taldar: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the Q&A session, and I would like to hand back to Sunil for any closing remarks.\nSunil Taldar: All right. If there are no more questions, I would like to thank you all for joining this call. And I look forward to speaking to you again and hopefully meeting with many of you later this year. Thank you once again.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "fullTranscript": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Airtel Africa's 9 month '24 Results. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I will now hand the conference over to Segun Ogunsanya. Please go ahead, sir.\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Thank you for joining us on today's call. And as always, joined by our CFO, Jaideep; and Deputy CFO and the Head of Investor Relations, Pier. We're going to be asking you a question very shortly. But first, I'd like to provide a brief overview of the performance over the last 9 months. We have reported a strong operating performance in constant currency with revenue growth of 20%, leading to reported revenues of $3.86 billion over the 9 month period. In Q3, third quarter, we saw constant currency revenue growth accelerate from 19% in Q2 to 21% in Q3, reflecting continued success in our strategy across all of our 3 regions. This strong top line performance, combined with further cost efficiencies, have driven EBITDA 21.9% in constant currency terms, leading to an industry-leading EBITDA margin of 49.4% for the group. Given the strength of this performance to date and according leverage, the board has approved a share buyback scheme of up to $100 million starting in early March 2024 over a 12-month period. On a reported currency basis, our results have been impacted by the recent currency devaluation we've seen across a number of markets, particularly in Nigeria where following the sharp devaluation in June, there was a further 22.5% devaluation over the last quarter. And in Malawi, the currency devalued by 44% in November. This has led to a decline in reported revenues of 1.4% over the 9-month period, with EBITDA largely stable over the year. This backdrop has led to a restatement of U.S. dollar liabilities in our costs, resulting in a significant increase in our finance costs, which has impacted our EPS for the period. The recent currency moves do not impact the strategy across our markets, which is maximizing the growth of our business in order to limit the impact of currency headwinds. We will continue to invest as our mission to transform lives by providing essential, reliable services at an affordable level becomes even more important. Before discussing our performance across our 2 main reporting segments, I'd like to highlight our Q3 constant currency performance on a regional basis, including both mobile services and mobile money. In Nigeria, we saw an acceleration of our growth to 24.7% in Q3, resulting in a 9-month growth of almost 23%. In East Africa, revenue growth of 25.3% was about 1 percentage point faster than the previous quarter. The Francophone Africa region also saw a similar acceleration in growth to 10.6%. Now I'll begin by focusing on the performance of the mobile services segment: our voice and data business. The strong demand for services across our footprint, combined with our focus on affordability and the current inflationary environment led to a 9.1 percentage increase in the customer base, which when combined with ARPU growth of 8.6%, resulted in constant currency revenue growth of 18.6%. In Nigeria, constant currency mobile service revenue grew 22.7% over the 9-month period. And in East Africa, it grew by 21.2%. Francophone country was up 10.3%. Trends in voice remain very encouraging, with revenue growth over by 11% in constant currency. The very low levels of SIM penetration and increased minutes across our network continue to support [ evolved ] performance. The growth this quarter is further supported by 28.5% growth in data revenues as our focus remains on increasing and improving the network coverage and capacity to drive increased data adoption. We currently have over 34 million 4G customers across the 14 countries. It has increased by almost 45% over the year and only 23% of our total customers and 55% of our data customers are currently using 4G, giving us the confidence in sustained data growth going forward. The mobile money business continue to see a very strong performance with a 3% constant currency revenue growth in Q3, which is an acceleration from the previous quarter, and it is the fastest-growing mobile money business in Africa. This strong growth was driven by continued customer growth of almost 20% and further enhancement of the mobile money ecosystem, driving transaction value almost 35% higher in constant currencies. As previously noted, the strong top line performance, combined with the continued focus on cost efficiencies, supported EBITDA growth of 21.9% in constant currency terms, resulting in a 47 basis point expansion in our EBITDA margin to 49.94% in the 9-month period. This margin improvement was particularly pleasing, given the increased energy cost and FX pressures in the period. It is a reflection of our focus on cost optimization. And as I mentioned earlier, finance costs were materially impacted by the exceptional currency devaluations seen in Nigeria in June and more recently in Malawi in November, which resulted in a $330 million after-tax charge impacting our earnings per share. After adjusting for these losses, EPS before exceptional items came in at $0.071, down 35%, reflecting the many currency headwinds, which impacted FX losses and transition impact of the currency weakness in our operating results. As many of you know, the naira continue to see further pressure in Q3, resulting in a $140 million FX loss after tax, which would not classify as an exceptional item in this quarter. If you adjust for the impact of this naira devaluation over the full 9-month period, EPS before exceptional items would have been $0.125. Briefly, in terms of the balance sheet at the end of December, our leverage ratio has reduced to 1.3x, EBITDA from 1.5x despite the impact of currency on our EBITDA. Our net debt declined to under $3.3 billion from over $3.6 billion a year ago. One of our key priorities over the last few years has been the derisking of our balance sheet by reducing Holdco debt and reducing other dollar debt. At the end of December, we had $560 million of cash at the HoldCo. This will allow us to fully repay the $550 million Holdco debt that is due for repayment in May of 2024. Our capital allocation policy remains unchanged. Our priority is to continue to invest in the business to ensure we future-proof operations for sustained growth and we therefore reiterate our previous quoted guidance of $800 million to $825 million for this financial year. The success of our balance sheet deleveraging has also enabled us to capitalize on other new opportunities such as our new data center business that we launched in December last year. Furthermore, we will continue to actually reduce our balance sheet FX exposure and continue to upstream cash from our various Holdco's to support our shareholder return priorities. As you have seen from our results, our focus has contributed to strong operational and financial performance, and we continue to demonstrate positive momentum on all of our key operating metrics. Our net time focus will remain on investing in our network and on further expanding our distribution infrastructure to be closer to our customers, at the same time, building new services for future growth. Clearly, our reported results have been impacted by the currency devaluation across the number of markets mentioned, Nigeria, Malawi, Zambia, and Kenya. But let me give you 3 ways with which we aim to limit the impact that this has on our business. First, our priority is to maximize top line growth to offset potential currency weakness. This has achieved reinvestment into improved network coverage and capacity to drive very strong subscriber growth and facilitate increased usage. All of this is underpinned by an attractive customer proposition and user experience. If you look at what we've done over the last 5 years, it will help provide some context. In constant currency, over the last 5 years, Q3 revenues have increased by more than 18% CAGR, and EBITDA by over 22% CAGR. Incorporating the latest currency movements, this has translated into reported currency 5-year CAGR of 9.6%, almost 10% in reported currency, and EBITDA of over 12%. I think this reflects the strength of the business model, despite the macro headwinds which we sometimes face. Secondly, we look to limit the impact that FX has on our operational performance by minimizing foreign exchange-based costs. Once again, over the last 5 years, despite the currency headwinds, our Q3 reported EBITDA margins have expanded 5.7 percentage points, reflecting once again the success of our strategy. And finally, we aim to reduce the amount of foreign exchange liabilities in our balance sheet. Currently, 40% of our market debt is in foreign currency. A year ago, it was 55%. However, excluding the Holdco bond which is due for repayment in May, our foreign exchange debt amounts to only 21% of total market debt. It is this strategy that we believe differentiates us. Our approach to the market, the scale of the opportunity and the willingness to invest significant capital into the market to capture this opportunity has not changed. We are confident that this approach will continue to support our investment case and further enhance shareholder value. In the light of this performance and, given the strength of our balance sheet, which is clear from the results we have published today, the board has approved the intention to launch a share buyback program of up to $100 million, beginning in early March over a 12-month period. And with that, I'd now like to open the line for questions for which I'm going to be joined by Jaideep and Pier. Operator, I now hand over to you to facilitate the Q&A session. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Karidis of Deutsche Numis.\nJohn Numis: Firstly, I wanted to thank Pier for all the help and advice he's given and wish him the best for the future. Secondly, I'd like to make a request, please, that we were going to have a roundtable discussion after the Q2 results. This couldn't happen, unfortunately. Maybe you can consider doing it now. And then 2 questions. Firstly, on the data center business, it would be really nice to get some sort of basic information about how many data centers do you have or do you plan to have, where are they, when will the next one open, please. So that's on the data center business. And then on the mobile money business, specifically in Nigeria, I understand that when customers deposit money into Airtel Money, you have to pay agents and they earn commission. So as people deposit money, you are actually having a startup loss. Is this -- how significant is this, please? And how significant has it been? And of course, the [ $6 ] million question is, when are you likely to start monetizing mobile money in Nigeria?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: I'm sure Pier is thankful for your kind words, so I'll let him relay it to you on that. On the roundtable event, my Investor Relations team would get back to you as to when we're going to have the roundtable. Let me take your data center question first. We got about 48 captive data centers across our portfolio. Those are being used by adjacent business for normal businesses. What we're talking about are telco-agnostic data centers. We put in 2, one in Nigeria, Lagos, a second one in Nairobi, Kenya. The one in Nigeria is about 36 megawatt and the one in Nairobi is going to be about 7 megawatt. So between the 2 data centers, we're looking at a capacity of over 40 megawatt. Very early days, we're going to break ground in Nigeria in the next couple of weeks, and the one in Kenya would follow soon. Construction takes about 2 years. So we're looking at them coming into operation probably sometime next year or '26. That's why it is 2 data centers. Beyond these 2 data centers, which are going to be telco-agnostic, we've got a number of cable landing stations that we're also going to have smaller data centers. These are the ones we have in Tanzania, we're also looking at 1 in DRC, 1 in Gabon. But the big data centers that are going to be commercially operated are the ones in Nigeria, massive one, that is 637 megawatt. The smaller one in Nairobi, that is going to be 7 megawatt. Those are the key stars in our portfolio. We did talk about the mobile money business, like I've said to you few quarters ago, the focus of our business in Nigeria is to just create a good base for a viable business. And the base is going to stand on 2 key pillars. One pillar is a very respectable customer base, which we keep building. And the second is agent network, not only agents, agents with cash and float that can service the market. We started this journey a few quarters ago. We continue to build on the infrastructure required to make this possible and I'm very happy with the progress we've made. Unfortunately, a few months ago, in December, we got a new direction from the Central Bank that all customer require different levels of verification. That will [cause] back a number of customers. But we're working on this to comply with all the requirements of CPA. And our focus remains on 2 things: expanding the customer base, expanding the agent base, agent float and cash balances. Those are the 2 clear priorities we're going to continue to focus on before we start thinking of monetization. And in terms of us paying money to agents, when they cash in, that's actually a feature of the mobile money business in most part of Africa anyway. Where the agents are providing the services, they're like mobile ATMs, so they collect money and once they do that, we need to pay them. We collect money from the customers when they cash out. So that's the model of mobile money business in most parts of the world, especially in Africa.\nOperator: The next question is from Rohit Modi of Citi.\nRohit Modi: Segun, I believe you will be there next quarter, but good luck for your future role. It's a couple of questions from my side. Firstly, if you could give us more color around the situation in Nigeria right now in terms of getting cash out, what rates you are getting, how easy it is now, or how difficult it is now compared to past. Secondly, on your liquidity position, you do have a refinancing coming, you do have a redemption coming, and you do have cash which you have highlighted. But just trying to understand, given most of your CapEx is in USD, would that mean that you do need a refinancing in future? And what kind of interest cost do you expect we should put in our models for following future years? Thirdly, in Nigeria, in terms of the price increase situation, are you still negotiating with the regulator, just as being follow-up or this is something which will not happen, looks unlikely in near future?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: I'm going to just answer them randomly. Let me start with the liquidity position and I'm sure Jaideep will come in and offer more light to this. We do have the $560 million cash in a bank to repay the Holdco debt which is due for payment in May. So that is done. We have enough money to pay each day if we choose to. We're going to pay [indiscernible] towards the end of summer in May. So that is settled. And Jaideep will come in at the end to just talk about that with my liquidity in general. In terms of the pricing in Nigeria. Pricing in Nigeria is regulated. You need leave of the regulator before you take price off. But like I've said numerous times, our model is quite different. We don't use price to drive the revenue accretion. We use customer addition and usage growth, all of our activities are geared towards -- on building more and more customers, given the very low level of SIM penetration in our countries. This is not different in Nigeria as well. The second thing we do is to put a lot of -- that we position out there that will drive usage. We continue to expand our 4G infrastructure, we continue to expand our normal 2G coverage. Those are the things we do to drive usage. We continue to expand our distribution infrastructure. Of course, if pricing comes, it's a sweetener, but we continue to engage the regulator on appropriate pricing, given the level of penetration in Nigeria. Is it a must have? No. Is it nice to have? Yes. And we're going to continue to work with the regulator to make sure this happens. So once again, if you look at our performance in Nigeria, we've grown about 25% in the last quarter. For the 9 months, it's about 22%, 23% for the 9 months up to December. It shows that the strategy is working, which is basically leveraging customer addition, leveraging usage to drive revenue accretion. That's a lot more sustainable than price inflation. And what was the third question? Jaideep, you want to come in and talk about liquidity management before I now come back on the issue of Nigeria, which -- this is -- I'm not an economist, but we just have too many issues we're dealing with in Nigeria, we're dealing with inflation, we're dealing with the devaluation, we're dealing with different outlook for GDP growth in the country. These are multiple challenges facing the country at the same time. But I believe that the government is looking at all these issues as well. We will continue to drive our business in a way that is delivering value to customers and to shareholders. We're not going to shy away from investing in largest country in Africa in terms of population, 220 million people. The demographics are quite good, many young people, still relatively low SIM card penetration. So despite those challenges around inflation, challenges around devaluation, challenges around low GDP growth, I still firmly believe that Nigeria is still a very attractive market to be in, long-term. Short-term, there will be temporary challenges. For long-term, we don't have any doubts that we're going to remain a big player in Nigeria for a very, very long time. Jaideep, you want to just talk about liquidity management in terms of -- I'm not sure what the gentleman wants.\nJaideep Paul: Thanks, Segun. So to answer your first question, we would not require any refinancing for paying the Holdco debt, that bond, because as Segun mentioned that -- and you have seen in our financials, that we have $560 million and we continue to upstream even in this subsequent period. That was on 31 December. So we have sufficient cash to take care of the bond repayment, number one. Number two, we have been able to upstream almost $530-plus million during the last 9 months, not only from Nigeria, of course, Nigeria volume has come down because of the scarcity, but across various geography. We are blessed to have 14 countries or diverse geographies from where we can continue to upstream money. And that's what we continue to do. From Nigeria specifically, we have been able to upstream almost about slightly short of $100 million. And this time, we have utilized this $100 million to pay off our vendor to reduce our dollar debt. So we have been using that cash to reduce our dollar liabilities in the balance sheet. And overall, I can tell you that we have taken a program for de-dollarization of the debt for last about 1 year or so. And consistently, we have been able to reduce the dollar exposure in many countries. Currently, if you look at other than the Holdco $550 million which will be paid off in May, other than that, whatever debt you are seeing at Opco level, roughly about 79% of that is in local currency. We have been able to de-dollarize it from a lower than 50% level now to about almost touching 80% level. Of course, that's why you have seen the interest cost has gone up a bit. But then the risk of devaluation, et cetera, for managing the Opco level debt has gone away. So now the earning is in local currency, debt is in local currency. There is no mismatch anymore, except that 20%. And out of that 20%, a large part is actually sitting in Nigeria, which we had to take, as we mentioned in the past, that we have to take that debt to survive the situation which we are going through for last couple of years. And now we've started repaying those debt. So broadly, that's the way and we continue to do the upstreaming and that's what -- one of the reason you have seen that board has approved the buyback of shares up to $100 million since we have that confidence. So we continue to do the upstream from all countries, wherever possible, we'll continue to do that.\nOperator: The next question is from Faisal Al Azmeh of Goldman Sachs.\nFaisal Al Azmeh: Just starting off with your comment on margins, obviously, you've been effectively working on enhancing margins and kind of partly to offset the current currency environment. As we think about the room that remains in terms of how much more you can do on the margins front, how should we think about next year and the year after? Do you feel that you've maxed out what you can do or there's more potential? And that is obviously excluding any pricing impact. So that's my first question. And then my second question just relates to 5G. Maybe if you can just give us a bit of an update. We know that you've mentioned in the past that it's still kind of a small part of what the countries have in mind. Has that changed at all?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Let me start with the margin because you know, as a policy, we don't give guidance on future EBITDA, but we've got a very clear strategy around the margins. And that is for every $1 that we add to the top line, at least minimum $0.50 should go towards the bottom line. We've met that requirement quarter after quarter. And how do we do this? By just having a very strong focus on OpEx control, by looking at all of our processes and redesigning those processes to ensure that this flow-through is maintained. The other thing we do is to continue to grow the top line anyway and we've -- quarter after quarter, we expand our top line by very high double-digit. That has supported our drive to increasing EBITDA. I must confess, the last couple of quarters we've seen major headwinds coming from fuel in a number of countries, Nigeria specifically, few countries in East Africa. We also continue to see the impact of devaluation affecting our operating margin. But despite this, we maintain an expanded EBITDA slightly this quarter. Going forward, I would talk about maintaining EBITDA. I'll talk about resilient EBITDA and the opportunity for further expansion. I'm not able to talk about it for now. All I can say is like we would continue to maintain EBITDA. Currently, as I speak now, we're probably one of the most profitable telco in Africa at 49.4%. And another thing is, we continue to work on, one, with our telco partners, we're looking for ways of converting one of our cost driver, which is diesel. We're looking at installing more solar panels, more lithium batteries, more grid connection. We're looking at converting some of our recharges from physical recharges into digital recharges through banks, through our mobile money. We're working at transmission infrastructure to reroute some transmission paths to more efficient path. All these opportunities continue to evolve and we continue to exploit them. But I'm very conscious of the ongoing challenges around diesel, ongoing challenges around devaluation, but we would do whatever it takes to maintain our EBITDA at the current margins. Your second question around 5G. We bought the spectrum a couple of years ago. We spent $280 million roughly to buy 5G spectrum in Nigeria. And across many countries, we do have the spectrum. We have launched 5G in Nigeria. We've launched 5G in Zambia. We've launched 5G in Kenya. We've launched 5G in Tanzania. These are very early days. And one clear opportunity I see for 5G is in home broadband. You know the fiber infrastructure in Africa is very little. And 1 clear pillar for driving penetration of home broadband is using the wireless. And that is one clear use case for 5G. In terms of mobility, I still believe that the opportunities for rapid expansion of 5G mobility is still limited in the short term. Medium and long-term, yes, we're going to see expansion of the devices. Devices are still very expensive in Africa and devices drive usage. When you don't have the affordable devices, it's going to be difficult for people to really consume 5G. But we are going to pursue 5G as a driver of home broadband by having routers and MiFis that are able to consume 5G for fixed broadband and usage. So that's where we are. We've deployed a number of sites in 4 countries, most of them in Nigeria, some in Zambia, some in Tanzania. We've seen some [indiscernible] of usage, but the clear use case for now will be on home broadband.\nOperator: The next question is from Jonathan Kennedy-Good of Prescient Securities.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: May I ask what percentage of your Nigerian OpEx is dollar-based? And then furthermore, in terms of the derivatives that you have to hedge your exposure in Nigeria, what proportion of those derivatives hedge OpEx versus balance sheet items? And then finally, just on your cash flow statement, I saw that there was a massive investments or, call it, investment with banks of $850 million. Is that related to margin for these derivatives or is it another item?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Okay. Let me take the OpEx first and Jaideep would come in on the derivatives and the cash flow question. In terms of OpEx, like we've done in many other calls, we've moved away from a foreign currency operating expense to mainly local currency. And in Nigeria, the percentage of expenses that are denominated in foreign currency is about 7% or less. We've done this over the last couple of years. So to a large extent, our operating expenses are more or less from FX fluctuation, given that we've got less than 7% of OpEx being denominated in foreign currency. In terms of the derivatives, Jaideep, do you want to comment on this?\nJaideep Paul: Yes. So we have a standard hedging policy, which we apply, that is applicable for both OpEx and CapEx, though not necessarily that's -- these derivatives are sometimes deliverable, delivered, not delivered. But we do take the hedging in terms of both OpEx and CapEx, if it is dollar denominated. And that we consistently apply. In terms of your second question on the cash flow, that $840 million, what you are referring to, is the trust balance. It's a trust account balance. This is the customers money which is kept in the trust account for Airtel Money. So it's not -- that's why it is a restricted cash. It's not available for us. But it is part of the cash flow as per the standard that we need to disclose as a part of the cash flow document. But that's relating to the Airtel Money trust account.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: And I presume that -- yes, okay. So there was a significant inflow of mobile money deposits, I would assume. And which markets were driving that?\nJaideep Paul: Sorry? Mobile money, what?\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: I presume there was a significant inflow of mobile money deposits then, or am I incorrect?\nJaideep Paul: See, almost all the markets of mobile money, you can see the transaction volume growth which has been reported. So there is a significant jump in the transaction volume over the last one year. And that transaction volume is an indicative factor that how much additional cash is coming in the trust accounts. So both are linked.\nOperator: The next question is Madhvendra Singh from HSBC.\nMadhvendra Singh: A couple of questions from my side and one clarification also. So the first question is on your revenue growth profile. So another quarter where voice growth has really surprised positively, while data growth kind of remains in the similar territory. So if you could explain what is driving this resurgence in voice growth. Is there any specific commercial offers, campaigns which you're running on the voice side? Are you setting up more towers? Are you expanding your coverage? So just want to understand this voice growth. Second question is around your CapEx plan. I understand it is a bit too early, but given how naira rate is evolving, if you could talk whether you would take the new naira rates into account for your future CapEx plans. Are you going to be focusing on the CapEx to sales ratios, maintaining that at certain levels? If you could talk about that, that will be great. And finally, if you could just talk about what's going on in the FX market in Nigeria right now and whether you have done -- participated in any FX transactions recently, like any extremes recently at the new rates which are flagging in the market right now, like NGN 1,400 and so on. And what would be your rate of -- is that the rate you will be translating the earnings for the period going forward if this rate stays around this level? Is that the relevant rate we are looking at?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Let me start with the question on voice. In my opening remarks, I did mention the very low unique SIM card penetration in Africa and most of our territory is still very low. And if you combine it with the low levels of voice consumption, let me give you some figures, on the average, the voice consumption is about 290 minutes per month for every person -- there is like 290 minutes in our footprint in Africa. In India, comparatively, it's about 600 minutes, more than twice. That shows the many opportunity available for a lot more people to talk a lot more in Africa. So if you combine these two metrics, the very low level of unique SIM card penetration, the very low level of voice minutes consumption, that explains why we continue to grow voice quarter after quarter. And on top of this, we continue to expand our distribution infrastructure, our reach into rural areas, our more efficient distribution in urban areas to really drive penetration of our SIM cards., availability of recharges through digital means, through mobile money. These are clear drivers that bring a lot more people to the franchise. And that's why you see -- going to continue to see increase in voice revenue quarter after quarter, year after year in our footprint in Africa. And we're very bullish about capturing this growth by continuing to invest in capacity in our territories. On the average, we roll out almost 3,000 sites every year to drive additional coverage in many parts of our footprint. Nigeria, which is one of the largest markets in Africa, we've done only 82% coverage. That shows the opportunity available to bring a lot more people into the digital world [indiscernible] our coverage. And the first thing you do is to talk on the phone. So we're very bullish about capturing this growth. We're going to continue to invest in our territories. We're going to continue to invest in Nigeria despite the FX challenges. Jaideep will give you more color on the CapEx plan. Our CapEx intensity will remain around 14% to 15%. That's what we've done. We've given guidance of between $800 million and $825 million for this year. We'll stay within that guidance. We're not in a position to share what the future CapEx plan would be, therefore now we say very clear that this year we'll be between $800 million and $825 million [indiscernible] for the full year. For the FX market in Nigeria, it's a difficult thing to predict or to really -- it's constantly evolving. Last week was a different market. Two days ago, it was something different, yesterday was something different as well. So you really need a crystal ball to be able to predict what FX would be on a particular day. One thing I can say, we comply with our regulations. We don't go out of any regulations and we just run our business within the rules of the game. Yes, it's been slightly more difficult assessing foreign exchange despite the price in the country. We continue to work with our banks, we continue to look for ways of assessing the FX required. And one thing we've said is like this illiquidity will not affect our investment appetite for Nigeria. We're still going to find ways of importing the right equipment to expand the network, to offer Nigerians the opportunity to be part of the digital world. Jaideep, anything you want to add on the CapEx piece?\nJaideep Paul: No, Segun, I don't have to add anything on the CapEx side. Only thing is that we will probably be able to give a guidance as we complete the full year and go for the full year announcement. At that time, we will give the guidance for the next year for CapEx. On the last question of forex and translating rate, et cetera, we always use the NAFEX rate as our translation rate. So it's like a daily restatement of the book based on the applicable rate of that date. Right? So as we progress to quarter 4, and if this rate, what is there NGN 1,400-plus, which is there in the NAFEX window, if that is still continuing at that rate, so every day it gets restated at that particular rate. If it changes, then we'll apply that changes for those days. So for us, every -- all our business cases, all our books, everything is getting recalculated based on the applicable rate all the time. So I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: The next question is from Oluwaseun Arambada of FBNQuest.\nOluwaseun Arambada: Some of my questions have been asked partly, but the first one still on your deleveraging strategy. I know you said earlier that you're not looking at a situation where you refinance, so I guess that means you're paying down the USD debt outrightly. But I'm also thinking, given your plans for over the next 12 months, over the next 12 months, you intend to do a share buyback [Audio Gap].\nJaideep Paul: Sorry, we could not hear the question.\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: I think we lost him.\nOluwaseun Arambada: Hello, can you hear me?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Okay.\nOluwaseun Arambada: Okay, sorry, you lost me. So I was speaking about your deleveraging strategy. I know you said earlier that you're not looking at a situation where you refinance, that you'll be paying down your Holdco U.S. debt outrightly, but considering the plans that you have for the next 12 months, thereabouts, you plan on doing a share buyback. And I know you're also ever committed to investing in your network infrastructure and investments generally. So I'm just concerned about how [Audio Gap]\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: I guess I'll probably answer this if you can hear me. If you can see from the results we have announced today and from the ones we announced in the past, we have a very strong ability to generate cash and upstream the cash to the Holdco. Jaideep just mentioned $530 million we upstreamed in the 9 months ended December. So our ability to generate and to upstream cash is not significantly impacted by what is happening in Nigeria. That's number 1. Number 2, over the last number of quarters too, we've improved our leverage to 1.3x from almost 2-point-something few years ago. That is significant improvement. So I really don't see any major headwind to pay down the debt, which we have the cash to pay almost now, and also returning some money to shareholders in the form of this share buyback. At the same time, we still reiterate our dividend policy that we described many times, that we continue to grow dividend single to -- single-digit -- mid to high single-digit. Those are the things we're going to continue to do without having significant impact on our borrowing capacity.\nOperator: The next question is from Cesar Tiron of Bank of America.\nCesar Tiron: Sorry, if they've been asked already. I have 2 questions. Can you please talk about your efforts to get those price increases and where do you stand with your discussions with the regulator? And then can you please clarify the exact cash impact of the derivative losses which you've recorded in the P&L?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: On the derivative issue, Jaideep is going to stick to it. For the pricing increase, like I said earlier, we need to engage with the regulator about what price to take, when to take it, voice and data, but it's not really an imperative for us. You've seen in our Nigerian results as well. We've grown voice revenue, we've grown data revenue. We've done this basically by driving 2 things: customer numbers and consumption, letting them consume more megabytes, consume more minutes and hopefully we let them use their mobile wallet for financial activities. That's what is completely within our control. As a sweetener, we continue to engage the regulator for appropriate pricing, given the level of inflation, given devaluation in the country. Don't know when this would fully resolve. Therefore now we continue to run the business by just driving consumption, by onboarding more customers, by expanding the network, by making sure we have the right distribution infrastructure to onboard customer more efficiently. Those are the things that are completely within our control. But as a sweetener, we're still talking to the regulator for the right pricing in Nigeria.\nJaideep Paul: On the second question, on the cash impact on derivative loss. So firstly, let's understand how we do it. So, derivative instrument -- outstanding derivative instruments are always marked to market. So every month, every quarter, we restate that liability based on the mark-to-market. But that's not a cash loss, that's a provision which we create in the books. Now, at the time of unwinding of those derivative instrument, whatever is the applicable rate at which it will be unwinded, that will be the actual difference between the derivative booking and the loss. So if I have restated the derivative, let's hypothetically say at, let's say, up to this, originally it was booked and now it has come down by, let's say, it has dropped by NGN 400 naira or NGN 500, that then will be the cash impact when we unwind the derivative instrument on the due date. And that is the real cash impact, but not necessary that whatever we are providing, that will be the cash impact because it can improve also in the subsequent month. So it is not settled every month or daily or quarterly basis.\nOperator: Our last question is from Linet Muriungi of Absa Bank Kenya.\nLinet Muriungi: I'd appreciate a bit more color on CapEx. So the CapEx spend as at Q3 was about 60%, 63% of the targeted. Could you please share why CapEx spend is sort of trailing behind and is there a catalyst that would influence the aggressive [Technical Difficulty] in Q4? And thanks for sharing the targeted CapEx sales ratio at the group level, but could you please give us a breakdown per region?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Jaideep, you want to handle this?\nJaideep Paul: Yes. The first question was CapEx spend is high in Q3, Q4. See, that's -- historically also, if you look around, Q3, Q4 will be the higher one because of the ordering cycle, then receipt of material. And it's a long gestation period we have between just placing the order and getting the material and getting it deployed. Because keep in mind that some of our countries are landlocked and you have to take it through road infrastructure, some of the material passing 2, 3 countries and then reach at the destination. So it takes longer period of time for the delivery and installation of the equipment. So generally, we'll see quarter 3 and quarter 4 will be always, CapEx-wise, on a higher side, and quarter 1 and 2 will be relatively lower, number 1. Number 2, your second question was region-wise CapEx, is it?\nLinet Muriungi: Yes, please.\nJaideep Paul: Okay, so region-wise CapEx, we have already given in our trading update. If you see the Nigeria CapEx, for 9 month, we have spent $178 million. East Africa, we spend almost same amount, $177 million. And for Franco Africa, we spend about $109 million. That's total of $464 million, which we spent on the mobile service. And mobile money CapEx is about $17 million. That is primarily spent on the platform infrastructure and so on and so forth, and cybersecurity and related items.\nLinet Muriungi: Sorry, just to confirm, should we expect the allocation per region, or perhaps the CapEx to sales ratio to change, especially in light of the FX headwinds that are being experienced in particular markets?\nJaideep Paul: See, our CapEx spend is not based on really a percentage of that region or that. It is all based on -- we spend CapEx based on our revenue growth projection and the potential where we have. So that's the way we allocate CapEx to each of the country and each of the region. So it's very difficult for me to say what will be the share of allocation or if there is any change. So if a country has the potential to grow revenue, we'll put CapEx there, and there, actually, we generally do not consider the devaluation or forex sensitivity because -- and that's the reason Segun has already mentioned that in Nigeria, in spite of such a sharp devaluation, we continue to hold our investment and continue to invest in Nigeria. Because, don't forget that Nigeria, in a constant currency, is growing at 24%. Quarter 3 growth was 24%, which is a very, very good growth. Same is for some of the other countries. So CapEx is allocated based on where we have the opportunity, where we have need, and where we need to build our infrastructure and network for future.\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: And also, just to be very clear, devaluation is not a permanent feature of any of our countries. It happens over 1 or 2 years and the currency stabilizes. But you need to invest in them at the right time, otherwise you're going to be caught far behind. So if you own investment, because you are waiting for currency to recover, you're going to be far, far behind the curve. That is where we don't want to be. So we know that these are very tough times in Nigeria, tough times in Malawi, a few other countries, but our philosophy remains unchanged. We're investing behind growth. The growth will return. And if you average some of these changes, we're talking about our 5-year, which is why I gave you the 5-year CAGR. The 5-year CAGR for revenue growth is more or less at 10%. The 5-year CAGR for EBITDA is also about 10%. So if you remove all those highs and lows, on a straight line curve, we see doing well in most of the countries, despite one-off devaluations that really create a busyness in the investment profile of some companies.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen. That is all that we have time for questions and I would like to hand back to Segun for some closing remarks.\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Yes, I'd just like to thank all of you for joining us, today's call. I look forward to speaking to all of you again, hopefully towards -- sometime May, June, when we discuss our full year results with all of you. Thank you. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that then concludes today's event. And you may now disconnect your lines.",

      "transcript": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Airtel Africa's 9 month '24 Results. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I will now hand the conference over to Segun Ogunsanya. Please go ahead, sir.\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Thank you for joining us on today's call. And as always, joined by our CFO, Jaideep; and Deputy CFO and the Head of Investor Relations, Pier. We're going to be asking you a question very shortly. But first, I'd like to provide a brief overview of the performance over the last 9 months. We have reported a strong operating performance in constant currency with revenue growth of 20%, leading to reported revenues of $3.86 billion over the 9 month period. In Q3, third quarter, we saw constant currency revenue growth accelerate from 19% in Q2 to 21% in Q3, reflecting continued success in our strategy across all of our 3 regions. This strong top line performance, combined with further cost efficiencies, have driven EBITDA 21.9% in constant currency terms, leading to an industry-leading EBITDA margin of 49.4% for the group. Given the strength of this performance to date and according leverage, the board has approved a share buyback scheme of up to $100 million starting in early March 2024 over a 12-month period. On a reported currency basis, our results have been impacted by the recent currency devaluation we've seen across a number of markets, particularly in Nigeria where following the sharp devaluation in June, there was a further 22.5% devaluation over the last quarter. And in Malawi, the currency devalued by 44% in November. This has led to a decline in reported revenues of 1.4% over the 9-month period, with EBITDA largely stable over the year. This backdrop has led to a restatement of U.S. dollar liabilities in our costs, resulting in a significant increase in our finance costs, which has impacted our EPS for the period. The recent currency moves do not impact the strategy across our markets, which is maximizing the growth of our business in order to limit the impact of currency headwinds. We will continue to invest as our mission to transform lives by providing essential, reliable services at an affordable level becomes even more important. Before discussing our performance across our 2 main reporting segments, I'd like to highlight our Q3 constant currency performance on a regional basis, including both mobile services and mobile money. In Nigeria, we saw an acceleration of our growth to 24.7% in Q3, resulting in a 9-month growth of almost 23%. In East Africa, revenue growth of 25.3% was about 1 percentage point faster than the previous quarter. The Francophone Africa region also saw a similar acceleration in growth to 10.6%. Now I'll begin by focusing on the performance of the mobile services segment: our voice and data business. The strong demand for services across our footprint, combined with our focus on affordability and the current inflationary environment led to a 9.1 percentage increase in the customer base, which when combined with ARPU growth of 8.6%, resulted in constant currency revenue growth of 18.6%. In Nigeria, constant currency mobile service revenue grew 22.7% over the 9-month period. And in East Africa, it grew by 21.2%. Francophone country was up 10.3%. Trends in voice remain very encouraging, with revenue growth over by 11% in constant currency. The very low levels of SIM penetration and increased minutes across our network continue to support [ evolved ] performance. The growth this quarter is further supported by 28.5% growth in data revenues as our focus remains on increasing and improving the network coverage and capacity to drive increased data adoption. We currently have over 34 million 4G customers across the 14 countries. It has increased by almost 45% over the year and only 23% of our total customers and 55% of our data customers are currently using 4G, giving us the confidence in sustained data growth going forward. The mobile money business continue to see a very strong performance with a 3% constant currency revenue growth in Q3, which is an acceleration from the previous quarter, and it is the fastest-growing mobile money business in Africa. This strong growth was driven by continued customer growth of almost 20% and further enhancement of the mobile money ecosystem, driving transaction value almost 35% higher in constant currencies. As previously noted, the strong top line performance, combined with the continued focus on cost efficiencies, supported EBITDA growth of 21.9% in constant currency terms, resulting in a 47 basis point expansion in our EBITDA margin to 49.94% in the 9-month period. This margin improvement was particularly pleasing, given the increased energy cost and FX pressures in the period. It is a reflection of our focus on cost optimization. And as I mentioned earlier, finance costs were materially impacted by the exceptional currency devaluations seen in Nigeria in June and more recently in Malawi in November, which resulted in a $330 million after-tax charge impacting our earnings per share. After adjusting for these losses, EPS before exceptional items came in at $0.071, down 35%, reflecting the many currency headwinds, which impacted FX losses and transition impact of the currency weakness in our operating results. As many of you know, the naira continue to see further pressure in Q3, resulting in a $140 million FX loss after tax, which would not classify as an exceptional item in this quarter. If you adjust for the impact of this naira devaluation over the full 9-month period, EPS before exceptional items would have been $0.125. Briefly, in terms of the balance sheet at the end of December, our leverage ratio has reduced to 1.3x, EBITDA from 1.5x despite the impact of currency on our EBITDA. Our net debt declined to under $3.3 billion from over $3.6 billion a year ago. One of our key priorities over the last few years has been the derisking of our balance sheet by reducing Holdco debt and reducing other dollar debt. At the end of December, we had $560 million of cash at the HoldCo. This will allow us to fully repay the $550 million Holdco debt that is due for repayment in May of 2024. Our capital allocation policy remains unchanged. Our priority is to continue to invest in the business to ensure we future-proof operations for sustained growth and we therefore reiterate our previous quoted guidance of $800 million to $825 million for this financial year. The success of our balance sheet deleveraging has also enabled us to capitalize on other new opportunities such as our new data center business that we launched in December last year. Furthermore, we will continue to actually reduce our balance sheet FX exposure and continue to upstream cash from our various Holdco's to support our shareholder return priorities. As you have seen from our results, our focus has contributed to strong operational and financial performance, and we continue to demonstrate positive momentum on all of our key operating metrics. Our net time focus will remain on investing in our network and on further expanding our distribution infrastructure to be closer to our customers, at the same time, building new services for future growth. Clearly, our reported results have been impacted by the currency devaluation across the number of markets mentioned, Nigeria, Malawi, Zambia, and Kenya. But let me give you 3 ways with which we aim to limit the impact that this has on our business. First, our priority is to maximize top line growth to offset potential currency weakness. This has achieved reinvestment into improved network coverage and capacity to drive very strong subscriber growth and facilitate increased usage. All of this is underpinned by an attractive customer proposition and user experience. If you look at what we've done over the last 5 years, it will help provide some context. In constant currency, over the last 5 years, Q3 revenues have increased by more than 18% CAGR, and EBITDA by over 22% CAGR. Incorporating the latest currency movements, this has translated into reported currency 5-year CAGR of 9.6%, almost 10% in reported currency, and EBITDA of over 12%. I think this reflects the strength of the business model, despite the macro headwinds which we sometimes face. Secondly, we look to limit the impact that FX has on our operational performance by minimizing foreign exchange-based costs. Once again, over the last 5 years, despite the currency headwinds, our Q3 reported EBITDA margins have expanded 5.7 percentage points, reflecting once again the success of our strategy. And finally, we aim to reduce the amount of foreign exchange liabilities in our balance sheet. Currently, 40% of our market debt is in foreign currency. A year ago, it was 55%. However, excluding the Holdco bond which is due for repayment in May, our foreign exchange debt amounts to only 21% of total market debt. It is this strategy that we believe differentiates us. Our approach to the market, the scale of the opportunity and the willingness to invest significant capital into the market to capture this opportunity has not changed. We are confident that this approach will continue to support our investment case and further enhance shareholder value. In the light of this performance and, given the strength of our balance sheet, which is clear from the results we have published today, the board has approved the intention to launch a share buyback program of up to $100 million, beginning in early March over a 12-month period. And with that, I'd now like to open the line for questions for which I'm going to be joined by Jaideep and Pier. Operator, I now hand over to you to facilitate the Q&A session. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Karidis of Deutsche Numis.\nJohn Numis: Firstly, I wanted to thank Pier for all the help and advice he's given and wish him the best for the future. Secondly, I'd like to make a request, please, that we were going to have a roundtable discussion after the Q2 results. This couldn't happen, unfortunately. Maybe you can consider doing it now. And then 2 questions. Firstly, on the data center business, it would be really nice to get some sort of basic information about how many data centers do you have or do you plan to have, where are they, when will the next one open, please. So that's on the data center business. And then on the mobile money business, specifically in Nigeria, I understand that when customers deposit money into Airtel Money, you have to pay agents and they earn commission. So as people deposit money, you are actually having a startup loss. Is this -- how significant is this, please? And how significant has it been? And of course, the [ $6 ] million question is, when are you likely to start monetizing mobile money in Nigeria?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: I'm sure Pier is thankful for your kind words, so I'll let him relay it to you on that. On the roundtable event, my Investor Relations team would get back to you as to when we're going to have the roundtable. Let me take your data center question first. We got about 48 captive data centers across our portfolio. Those are being used by adjacent business for normal businesses. What we're talking about are telco-agnostic data centers. We put in 2, one in Nigeria, Lagos, a second one in Nairobi, Kenya. The one in Nigeria is about 36 megawatt and the one in Nairobi is going to be about 7 megawatt. So between the 2 data centers, we're looking at a capacity of over 40 megawatt. Very early days, we're going to break ground in Nigeria in the next couple of weeks, and the one in Kenya would follow soon. Construction takes about 2 years. So we're looking at them coming into operation probably sometime next year or '26. That's why it is 2 data centers. Beyond these 2 data centers, which are going to be telco-agnostic, we've got a number of cable landing stations that we're also going to have smaller data centers. These are the ones we have in Tanzania, we're also looking at 1 in DRC, 1 in Gabon. But the big data centers that are going to be commercially operated are the ones in Nigeria, massive one, that is 637 megawatt. The smaller one in Nairobi, that is going to be 7 megawatt. Those are the key stars in our portfolio. We did talk about the mobile money business, like I've said to you few quarters ago, the focus of our business in Nigeria is to just create a good base for a viable business. And the base is going to stand on 2 key pillars. One pillar is a very respectable customer base, which we keep building. And the second is agent network, not only agents, agents with cash and float that can service the market. We started this journey a few quarters ago. We continue to build on the infrastructure required to make this possible and I'm very happy with the progress we've made. Unfortunately, a few months ago, in December, we got a new direction from the Central Bank that all customer require different levels of verification. That will [cause] back a number of customers. But we're working on this to comply with all the requirements of CPA. And our focus remains on 2 things: expanding the customer base, expanding the agent base, agent float and cash balances. Those are the 2 clear priorities we're going to continue to focus on before we start thinking of monetization. And in terms of us paying money to agents, when they cash in, that's actually a feature of the mobile money business in most part of Africa anyway. Where the agents are providing the services, they're like mobile ATMs, so they collect money and once they do that, we need to pay them. We collect money from the customers when they cash out. So that's the model of mobile money business in most parts of the world, especially in Africa.\nOperator: The next question is from Rohit Modi of Citi.\nRohit Modi: Segun, I believe you will be there next quarter, but good luck for your future role. It's a couple of questions from my side. Firstly, if you could give us more color around the situation in Nigeria right now in terms of getting cash out, what rates you are getting, how easy it is now, or how difficult it is now compared to past. Secondly, on your liquidity position, you do have a refinancing coming, you do have a redemption coming, and you do have cash which you have highlighted. But just trying to understand, given most of your CapEx is in USD, would that mean that you do need a refinancing in future? And what kind of interest cost do you expect we should put in our models for following future years? Thirdly, in Nigeria, in terms of the price increase situation, are you still negotiating with the regulator, just as being follow-up or this is something which will not happen, looks unlikely in near future?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: I'm going to just answer them randomly. Let me start with the liquidity position and I'm sure Jaideep will come in and offer more light to this. We do have the $560 million cash in a bank to repay the Holdco debt which is due for payment in May. So that is done. We have enough money to pay each day if we choose to. We're going to pay [indiscernible] towards the end of summer in May. So that is settled. And Jaideep will come in at the end to just talk about that with my liquidity in general. In terms of the pricing in Nigeria. Pricing in Nigeria is regulated. You need leave of the regulator before you take price off. But like I've said numerous times, our model is quite different. We don't use price to drive the revenue accretion. We use customer addition and usage growth, all of our activities are geared towards -- on building more and more customers, given the very low level of SIM penetration in our countries. This is not different in Nigeria as well. The second thing we do is to put a lot of -- that we position out there that will drive usage. We continue to expand our 4G infrastructure, we continue to expand our normal 2G coverage. Those are the things we do to drive usage. We continue to expand our distribution infrastructure. Of course, if pricing comes, it's a sweetener, but we continue to engage the regulator on appropriate pricing, given the level of penetration in Nigeria. Is it a must have? No. Is it nice to have? Yes. And we're going to continue to work with the regulator to make sure this happens. So once again, if you look at our performance in Nigeria, we've grown about 25% in the last quarter. For the 9 months, it's about 22%, 23% for the 9 months up to December. It shows that the strategy is working, which is basically leveraging customer addition, leveraging usage to drive revenue accretion. That's a lot more sustainable than price inflation. And what was the third question? Jaideep, you want to come in and talk about liquidity management before I now come back on the issue of Nigeria, which -- this is -- I'm not an economist, but we just have too many issues we're dealing with in Nigeria, we're dealing with inflation, we're dealing with the devaluation, we're dealing with different outlook for GDP growth in the country. These are multiple challenges facing the country at the same time. But I believe that the government is looking at all these issues as well. We will continue to drive our business in a way that is delivering value to customers and to shareholders. We're not going to shy away from investing in largest country in Africa in terms of population, 220 million people. The demographics are quite good, many young people, still relatively low SIM card penetration. So despite those challenges around inflation, challenges around devaluation, challenges around low GDP growth, I still firmly believe that Nigeria is still a very attractive market to be in, long-term. Short-term, there will be temporary challenges. For long-term, we don't have any doubts that we're going to remain a big player in Nigeria for a very, very long time. Jaideep, you want to just talk about liquidity management in terms of -- I'm not sure what the gentleman wants.\nJaideep Paul: Thanks, Segun. So to answer your first question, we would not require any refinancing for paying the Holdco debt, that bond, because as Segun mentioned that -- and you have seen in our financials, that we have $560 million and we continue to upstream even in this subsequent period. That was on 31 December. So we have sufficient cash to take care of the bond repayment, number one. Number two, we have been able to upstream almost $530-plus million during the last 9 months, not only from Nigeria, of course, Nigeria volume has come down because of the scarcity, but across various geography. We are blessed to have 14 countries or diverse geographies from where we can continue to upstream money. And that's what we continue to do. From Nigeria specifically, we have been able to upstream almost about slightly short of $100 million. And this time, we have utilized this $100 million to pay off our vendor to reduce our dollar debt. So we have been using that cash to reduce our dollar liabilities in the balance sheet. And overall, I can tell you that we have taken a program for de-dollarization of the debt for last about 1 year or so. And consistently, we have been able to reduce the dollar exposure in many countries. Currently, if you look at other than the Holdco $550 million which will be paid off in May, other than that, whatever debt you are seeing at Opco level, roughly about 79% of that is in local currency. We have been able to de-dollarize it from a lower than 50% level now to about almost touching 80% level. Of course, that's why you have seen the interest cost has gone up a bit. But then the risk of devaluation, et cetera, for managing the Opco level debt has gone away. So now the earning is in local currency, debt is in local currency. There is no mismatch anymore, except that 20%. And out of that 20%, a large part is actually sitting in Nigeria, which we had to take, as we mentioned in the past, that we have to take that debt to survive the situation which we are going through for last couple of years. And now we've started repaying those debt. So broadly, that's the way and we continue to do the upstreaming and that's what -- one of the reason you have seen that board has approved the buyback of shares up to $100 million since we have that confidence. So we continue to do the upstream from all countries, wherever possible, we'll continue to do that.\nOperator: The next question is from Faisal Al Azmeh of Goldman Sachs.\nFaisal Al Azmeh: Just starting off with your comment on margins, obviously, you've been effectively working on enhancing margins and kind of partly to offset the current currency environment. As we think about the room that remains in terms of how much more you can do on the margins front, how should we think about next year and the year after? Do you feel that you've maxed out what you can do or there's more potential? And that is obviously excluding any pricing impact. So that's my first question. And then my second question just relates to 5G. Maybe if you can just give us a bit of an update. We know that you've mentioned in the past that it's still kind of a small part of what the countries have in mind. Has that changed at all?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Let me start with the margin because you know, as a policy, we don't give guidance on future EBITDA, but we've got a very clear strategy around the margins. And that is for every $1 that we add to the top line, at least minimum $0.50 should go towards the bottom line. We've met that requirement quarter after quarter. And how do we do this? By just having a very strong focus on OpEx control, by looking at all of our processes and redesigning those processes to ensure that this flow-through is maintained. The other thing we do is to continue to grow the top line anyway and we've -- quarter after quarter, we expand our top line by very high double-digit. That has supported our drive to increasing EBITDA. I must confess, the last couple of quarters we've seen major headwinds coming from fuel in a number of countries, Nigeria specifically, few countries in East Africa. We also continue to see the impact of devaluation affecting our operating margin. But despite this, we maintain an expanded EBITDA slightly this quarter. Going forward, I would talk about maintaining EBITDA. I'll talk about resilient EBITDA and the opportunity for further expansion. I'm not able to talk about it for now. All I can say is like we would continue to maintain EBITDA. Currently, as I speak now, we're probably one of the most profitable telco in Africa at 49.4%. And another thing is, we continue to work on, one, with our telco partners, we're looking for ways of converting one of our cost driver, which is diesel. We're looking at installing more solar panels, more lithium batteries, more grid connection. We're looking at converting some of our recharges from physical recharges into digital recharges through banks, through our mobile money. We're working at transmission infrastructure to reroute some transmission paths to more efficient path. All these opportunities continue to evolve and we continue to exploit them. But I'm very conscious of the ongoing challenges around diesel, ongoing challenges around devaluation, but we would do whatever it takes to maintain our EBITDA at the current margins. Your second question around 5G. We bought the spectrum a couple of years ago. We spent $280 million roughly to buy 5G spectrum in Nigeria. And across many countries, we do have the spectrum. We have launched 5G in Nigeria. We've launched 5G in Zambia. We've launched 5G in Kenya. We've launched 5G in Tanzania. These are very early days. And one clear opportunity I see for 5G is in home broadband. You know the fiber infrastructure in Africa is very little. And 1 clear pillar for driving penetration of home broadband is using the wireless. And that is one clear use case for 5G. In terms of mobility, I still believe that the opportunities for rapid expansion of 5G mobility is still limited in the short term. Medium and long-term, yes, we're going to see expansion of the devices. Devices are still very expensive in Africa and devices drive usage. When you don't have the affordable devices, it's going to be difficult for people to really consume 5G. But we are going to pursue 5G as a driver of home broadband by having routers and MiFis that are able to consume 5G for fixed broadband and usage. So that's where we are. We've deployed a number of sites in 4 countries, most of them in Nigeria, some in Zambia, some in Tanzania. We've seen some [indiscernible] of usage, but the clear use case for now will be on home broadband.\nOperator: The next question is from Jonathan Kennedy-Good of Prescient Securities.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: May I ask what percentage of your Nigerian OpEx is dollar-based? And then furthermore, in terms of the derivatives that you have to hedge your exposure in Nigeria, what proportion of those derivatives hedge OpEx versus balance sheet items? And then finally, just on your cash flow statement, I saw that there was a massive investments or, call it, investment with banks of $850 million. Is that related to margin for these derivatives or is it another item?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Okay. Let me take the OpEx first and Jaideep would come in on the derivatives and the cash flow question. In terms of OpEx, like we've done in many other calls, we've moved away from a foreign currency operating expense to mainly local currency. And in Nigeria, the percentage of expenses that are denominated in foreign currency is about 7% or less. We've done this over the last couple of years. So to a large extent, our operating expenses are more or less from FX fluctuation, given that we've got less than 7% of OpEx being denominated in foreign currency. In terms of the derivatives, Jaideep, do you want to comment on this?\nJaideep Paul: Yes. So we have a standard hedging policy, which we apply, that is applicable for both OpEx and CapEx, though not necessarily that's -- these derivatives are sometimes deliverable, delivered, not delivered. But we do take the hedging in terms of both OpEx and CapEx, if it is dollar denominated. And that we consistently apply. In terms of your second question on the cash flow, that $840 million, what you are referring to, is the trust balance. It's a trust account balance. This is the customers money which is kept in the trust account for Airtel Money. So it's not -- that's why it is a restricted cash. It's not available for us. But it is part of the cash flow as per the standard that we need to disclose as a part of the cash flow document. But that's relating to the Airtel Money trust account.\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: And I presume that -- yes, okay. So there was a significant inflow of mobile money deposits, I would assume. And which markets were driving that?\nJaideep Paul: Sorry? Mobile money, what?\nJonathan Kennedy-Good: I presume there was a significant inflow of mobile money deposits then, or am I incorrect?\nJaideep Paul: See, almost all the markets of mobile money, you can see the transaction volume growth which has been reported. So there is a significant jump in the transaction volume over the last one year. And that transaction volume is an indicative factor that how much additional cash is coming in the trust accounts. So both are linked.\nOperator: The next question is Madhvendra Singh from HSBC.\nMadhvendra Singh: A couple of questions from my side and one clarification also. So the first question is on your revenue growth profile. So another quarter where voice growth has really surprised positively, while data growth kind of remains in the similar territory. So if you could explain what is driving this resurgence in voice growth. Is there any specific commercial offers, campaigns which you're running on the voice side? Are you setting up more towers? Are you expanding your coverage? So just want to understand this voice growth. Second question is around your CapEx plan. I understand it is a bit too early, but given how naira rate is evolving, if you could talk whether you would take the new naira rates into account for your future CapEx plans. Are you going to be focusing on the CapEx to sales ratios, maintaining that at certain levels? If you could talk about that, that will be great. And finally, if you could just talk about what's going on in the FX market in Nigeria right now and whether you have done -- participated in any FX transactions recently, like any extremes recently at the new rates which are flagging in the market right now, like NGN 1,400 and so on. And what would be your rate of -- is that the rate you will be translating the earnings for the period going forward if this rate stays around this level? Is that the relevant rate we are looking at?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Let me start with the question on voice. In my opening remarks, I did mention the very low unique SIM card penetration in Africa and most of our territory is still very low. And if you combine it with the low levels of voice consumption, let me give you some figures, on the average, the voice consumption is about 290 minutes per month for every person -- there is like 290 minutes in our footprint in Africa. In India, comparatively, it's about 600 minutes, more than twice. That shows the many opportunity available for a lot more people to talk a lot more in Africa. So if you combine these two metrics, the very low level of unique SIM card penetration, the very low level of voice minutes consumption, that explains why we continue to grow voice quarter after quarter. And on top of this, we continue to expand our distribution infrastructure, our reach into rural areas, our more efficient distribution in urban areas to really drive penetration of our SIM cards., availability of recharges through digital means, through mobile money. These are clear drivers that bring a lot more people to the franchise. And that's why you see -- going to continue to see increase in voice revenue quarter after quarter, year after year in our footprint in Africa. And we're very bullish about capturing this growth by continuing to invest in capacity in our territories. On the average, we roll out almost 3,000 sites every year to drive additional coverage in many parts of our footprint. Nigeria, which is one of the largest markets in Africa, we've done only 82% coverage. That shows the opportunity available to bring a lot more people into the digital world [indiscernible] our coverage. And the first thing you do is to talk on the phone. So we're very bullish about capturing this growth. We're going to continue to invest in our territories. We're going to continue to invest in Nigeria despite the FX challenges. Jaideep will give you more color on the CapEx plan. Our CapEx intensity will remain around 14% to 15%. That's what we've done. We've given guidance of between $800 million and $825 million for this year. We'll stay within that guidance. We're not in a position to share what the future CapEx plan would be, therefore now we say very clear that this year we'll be between $800 million and $825 million [indiscernible] for the full year. For the FX market in Nigeria, it's a difficult thing to predict or to really -- it's constantly evolving. Last week was a different market. Two days ago, it was something different, yesterday was something different as well. So you really need a crystal ball to be able to predict what FX would be on a particular day. One thing I can say, we comply with our regulations. We don't go out of any regulations and we just run our business within the rules of the game. Yes, it's been slightly more difficult assessing foreign exchange despite the price in the country. We continue to work with our banks, we continue to look for ways of assessing the FX required. And one thing we've said is like this illiquidity will not affect our investment appetite for Nigeria. We're still going to find ways of importing the right equipment to expand the network, to offer Nigerians the opportunity to be part of the digital world. Jaideep, anything you want to add on the CapEx piece?\nJaideep Paul: No, Segun, I don't have to add anything on the CapEx side. Only thing is that we will probably be able to give a guidance as we complete the full year and go for the full year announcement. At that time, we will give the guidance for the next year for CapEx. On the last question of forex and translating rate, et cetera, we always use the NAFEX rate as our translation rate. So it's like a daily restatement of the book based on the applicable rate of that date. Right? So as we progress to quarter 4, and if this rate, what is there NGN 1,400-plus, which is there in the NAFEX window, if that is still continuing at that rate, so every day it gets restated at that particular rate. If it changes, then we'll apply that changes for those days. So for us, every -- all our business cases, all our books, everything is getting recalculated based on the applicable rate all the time. So I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: The next question is from Oluwaseun Arambada of FBNQuest.\nOluwaseun Arambada: Some of my questions have been asked partly, but the first one still on your deleveraging strategy. I know you said earlier that you're not looking at a situation where you refinance, so I guess that means you're paying down the USD debt outrightly. But I'm also thinking, given your plans for over the next 12 months, over the next 12 months, you intend to do a share buyback [Audio Gap].\nJaideep Paul: Sorry, we could not hear the question.\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: I think we lost him.\nOluwaseun Arambada: Hello, can you hear me?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Okay.\nOluwaseun Arambada: Okay, sorry, you lost me. So I was speaking about your deleveraging strategy. I know you said earlier that you're not looking at a situation where you refinance, that you'll be paying down your Holdco U.S. debt outrightly, but considering the plans that you have for the next 12 months, thereabouts, you plan on doing a share buyback. And I know you're also ever committed to investing in your network infrastructure and investments generally. So I'm just concerned about how [Audio Gap]\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: I guess I'll probably answer this if you can hear me. If you can see from the results we have announced today and from the ones we announced in the past, we have a very strong ability to generate cash and upstream the cash to the Holdco. Jaideep just mentioned $530 million we upstreamed in the 9 months ended December. So our ability to generate and to upstream cash is not significantly impacted by what is happening in Nigeria. That's number 1. Number 2, over the last number of quarters too, we've improved our leverage to 1.3x from almost 2-point-something few years ago. That is significant improvement. So I really don't see any major headwind to pay down the debt, which we have the cash to pay almost now, and also returning some money to shareholders in the form of this share buyback. At the same time, we still reiterate our dividend policy that we described many times, that we continue to grow dividend single to -- single-digit -- mid to high single-digit. Those are the things we're going to continue to do without having significant impact on our borrowing capacity.\nOperator: The next question is from Cesar Tiron of Bank of America.\nCesar Tiron: Sorry, if they've been asked already. I have 2 questions. Can you please talk about your efforts to get those price increases and where do you stand with your discussions with the regulator? And then can you please clarify the exact cash impact of the derivative losses which you've recorded in the P&L?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: On the derivative issue, Jaideep is going to stick to it. For the pricing increase, like I said earlier, we need to engage with the regulator about what price to take, when to take it, voice and data, but it's not really an imperative for us. You've seen in our Nigerian results as well. We've grown voice revenue, we've grown data revenue. We've done this basically by driving 2 things: customer numbers and consumption, letting them consume more megabytes, consume more minutes and hopefully we let them use their mobile wallet for financial activities. That's what is completely within our control. As a sweetener, we continue to engage the regulator for appropriate pricing, given the level of inflation, given devaluation in the country. Don't know when this would fully resolve. Therefore now we continue to run the business by just driving consumption, by onboarding more customers, by expanding the network, by making sure we have the right distribution infrastructure to onboard customer more efficiently. Those are the things that are completely within our control. But as a sweetener, we're still talking to the regulator for the right pricing in Nigeria.\nJaideep Paul: On the second question, on the cash impact on derivative loss. So firstly, let's understand how we do it. So, derivative instrument -- outstanding derivative instruments are always marked to market. So every month, every quarter, we restate that liability based on the mark-to-market. But that's not a cash loss, that's a provision which we create in the books. Now, at the time of unwinding of those derivative instrument, whatever is the applicable rate at which it will be unwinded, that will be the actual difference between the derivative booking and the loss. So if I have restated the derivative, let's hypothetically say at, let's say, up to this, originally it was booked and now it has come down by, let's say, it has dropped by NGN 400 naira or NGN 500, that then will be the cash impact when we unwind the derivative instrument on the due date. And that is the real cash impact, but not necessary that whatever we are providing, that will be the cash impact because it can improve also in the subsequent month. So it is not settled every month or daily or quarterly basis.\nOperator: Our last question is from Linet Muriungi of Absa Bank Kenya.\nLinet Muriungi: I'd appreciate a bit more color on CapEx. So the CapEx spend as at Q3 was about 60%, 63% of the targeted. Could you please share why CapEx spend is sort of trailing behind and is there a catalyst that would influence the aggressive [Technical Difficulty] in Q4? And thanks for sharing the targeted CapEx sales ratio at the group level, but could you please give us a breakdown per region?\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Jaideep, you want to handle this?\nJaideep Paul: Yes. The first question was CapEx spend is high in Q3, Q4. See, that's -- historically also, if you look around, Q3, Q4 will be the higher one because of the ordering cycle, then receipt of material. And it's a long gestation period we have between just placing the order and getting the material and getting it deployed. Because keep in mind that some of our countries are landlocked and you have to take it through road infrastructure, some of the material passing 2, 3 countries and then reach at the destination. So it takes longer period of time for the delivery and installation of the equipment. So generally, we'll see quarter 3 and quarter 4 will be always, CapEx-wise, on a higher side, and quarter 1 and 2 will be relatively lower, number 1. Number 2, your second question was region-wise CapEx, is it?\nLinet Muriungi: Yes, please.\nJaideep Paul: Okay, so region-wise CapEx, we have already given in our trading update. If you see the Nigeria CapEx, for 9 month, we have spent $178 million. East Africa, we spend almost same amount, $177 million. And for Franco Africa, we spend about $109 million. That's total of $464 million, which we spent on the mobile service. And mobile money CapEx is about $17 million. That is primarily spent on the platform infrastructure and so on and so forth, and cybersecurity and related items.\nLinet Muriungi: Sorry, just to confirm, should we expect the allocation per region, or perhaps the CapEx to sales ratio to change, especially in light of the FX headwinds that are being experienced in particular markets?\nJaideep Paul: See, our CapEx spend is not based on really a percentage of that region or that. It is all based on -- we spend CapEx based on our revenue growth projection and the potential where we have. So that's the way we allocate CapEx to each of the country and each of the region. So it's very difficult for me to say what will be the share of allocation or if there is any change. So if a country has the potential to grow revenue, we'll put CapEx there, and there, actually, we generally do not consider the devaluation or forex sensitivity because -- and that's the reason Segun has already mentioned that in Nigeria, in spite of such a sharp devaluation, we continue to hold our investment and continue to invest in Nigeria. Because, don't forget that Nigeria, in a constant currency, is growing at 24%. Quarter 3 growth was 24%, which is a very, very good growth. Same is for some of the other countries. So CapEx is allocated based on where we have the opportunity, where we have need, and where we need to build our infrastructure and network for future.\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: And also, just to be very clear, devaluation is not a permanent feature of any of our countries. It happens over 1 or 2 years and the currency stabilizes. But you need to invest in them at the right time, otherwise you're going to be caught far behind. So if you own investment, because you are waiting for currency to recover, you're going to be far, far behind the curve. That is where we don't want to be. So we know that these are very tough times in Nigeria, tough times in Malawi, a few other countries, but our philosophy remains unchanged. We're investing behind growth. The growth will return. And if you average some of these changes, we're talking about our 5-year, which is why I gave you the 5-year CAGR. The 5-year CAGR for revenue growth is more or less at 10%. The 5-year CAGR for EBITDA is also about 10%. So if you remove all those highs and lows, on a straight line curve, we see doing well in most of the countries, despite one-off devaluations that really create a busyness in the investment profile of some companies.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen. That is all that we have time for questions and I would like to hand back to Segun for some closing remarks.\nOlusegun Ogunsanya: Yes, I'd just like to thank all of you for joining us, today's call. I look forward to speaking to all of you again, hopefully towards -- sometime May, June, when we discuss our full year results with all of you. Thank you. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that then concludes today's event. And you may now disconnect your lines.",

    "fullTranscript": "Lee Yuan Siong: Good morning and a warm welcome to AIA's annual results presentation. I am delighted to report that AIA has delivered an excellent financial performance in 2024. We achieved double-digit growth across our key metrics for new business, earnings and cash generation, demonstrating the benefits of our growth strategy. Let me now take you through the highlights. Value of new business was up by 18% to a record high of $4.7 billion, building on the strong momentum we have generated in previous years. EV equity increased to $71.6 billion, up by 9% per share after returning $6.5 billion to shareholders. Operating profit after tax also reached a record high, up by 12% per share, and underlying free surplus generation, our key operating measure of cash generation, grew by 10% per share. Following our capital management policy, the Board has recommended an increase of 10% in the final dividend per share and announced a new share buyback of $1.6 billion. As you can see, we are delivering profitable new business growth which is driving both strong earnings and cash flow generation. In this way, we create a virtuous circle, funding further capital investment in organic new business, growing our large stock of future earnings and delivering cash returns to shareholders. Premier agency is the main driver of profitable growth for the group, contributing 74% of our VONB. We have the world's leading agency, which has ranked number one globally by MDRT members for the last 10 years, and we hold the top position in nine markets. In 2024, agency delivered 16% VONB growth, driven by higher activity and productivity, combined with an increase in VONB margin. Recruitment was also up by 18% with positive growth across the vast majority of our markets. These strong results are the direct outcome of AIA's Premier Agency strategy, designed to enhance both customer satisfaction and agent performance. We attract high-quality and motivated individuals, equipping them with extensive training and leading digital tools to support their long-term career growth with AIA. A highly professional agency enables AIA to advise sophisticated and affluent customers on their more complex needs, improving customer experience and increasing demand for our services. In turn, this attracts more high-caliber agents to join AIA, creating a self-reinforcing cycle, contributing to our industry leadership and delivering high-quality new business growth at attractive returns for shareholders. This is what sets AIA apart. Our fast-growing profitable partnerships also present a valuable growth opportunity for AIA and our partners. In 2024, VONB was up by 28% to $1.3 billion driven by an excellent performance in bancassurance, which grew by 39%. We have a proven model of partnering with leading banks for the long-term, reflecting the aligned growth ambitions of both partners. Integrating AIA's leading technology enables us to run advanced analytics models that better target customers, making our professional insurance specialists even more productive. In this way, we drive long-term regular premium business with attractive margins and returns. As a result, over the last three years, VONB through our bancassurance channel has more than doubled, with an increase in margin to more than 40%. AIA's extensive network of high-quality strategic partners significantly extends our reach, creating opportunities to engage with more than 100 million target customers across Asia, providing a growing source of profitable new business. Our twin distribution engines drive growth across the Group and I will now take you through the highlights of our performance by market segment. AIA Hong Kong was again the largest contributor to the group's VONB in 2024, delivering a record $1.8 billion, up 23%. Demand was very strong across both domestic and Mainland Chinese visitor customer segments, with broadly equal VONB contributions from each, reflecting our diversified and growing customer base. AIA's Premier Agency is the leader in Hong Kong and Macau and our main source of new business in this market. The 23% increase in VONB from agency was supported by both growth in active agents and higher productivity. New recruits were up by 16% as we add greater capacity to meet the growing demand for AIA's products and services. Our agency also achieved strong sales from Mainland Chinese visitors, with the fourth quarter recording the highest VONB since cross-border travel resumed in early 2023. VONB from our partnerships grew by 25%, following double-digit growth in our bancassurance as well as IFA and broker channels. Overall, the combination of our leading distribution platform and attractive products keeps us well positioned for future growth in this important market. AIA China achieved 20% growth in VONB to over $1.2 billion, driven by higher volumes and profitability. Our ability to achieve substantial growth in a challenging local environment, marked by low interest rates, demonstrates the resilience of our strategy and the quality of our business model. AIA China's Premier Agency is the world leader in MDRT members and at the heart of our growth strategy. Our agents are highly professional with incomes double the industry average, enabling us to attract and retain the best candidates. As a result, new recruits grew by 18% and active agent numbers increased by 9%, demonstrating the health of our business. AIA is uniquely focused on meeting the needs of middle class and affluent customers in Mainland China, with professional advice and high-quality personalized products. Long-term customer relationships help sustain full-time careers for our agents and, in turn, help more customers to achieve their protection, long-term savings and retirement goals. This is demonstrated by our middle-class customers holding over six policies on average and a 9% increase in the number of new customers in 2024, providing additional future growth opportunities for our agency. Highly-selective bancassurance partnerships accelerate AIA China's growth and we delivered a significant uplift in new business and VONB margin in 2024. This was achieved through our focus on meeting the needs of the most affluent customers, with average case sizes above $20,000. Taken in combination with our world-leading Premier Agency, we have the right model to capture future value in this market. The high-quality new business that we are able to generate through our Premier Agency differentiates AIA in Mainland China. We have a well-balanced product mix with traditional protection delivering close to half of our agency VONB. Nearly all our agents sold a protection policy in 2024 and demand remains strong with a 26% year-on-year VONB increase. Protection is an essential part of financial planning and provides an important source of diversified earnings. AIA also leads the market in tax-incentivized products, targeted at affluent customers, and we broadened our range of products further during the year. By repricing our long-term savings products, withdrawing certain products early and shifting our focus towards participating products, we are proactively navigating the low-interest rate environment. In the first two months of the year, our agency has already successfully shifted the vast majority of our new business savings portfolio to par products, as shown here. These offer policyholders a higher expected return from a broader range of assets and are more resilient to interest rate movements. Our comprehensive suite of products, supported by a powerful ecosystem of value-added services and leveraging our distribution strength, enables us to deepen customer engagement, expand our potential customer base and drive long-term growth. And there is significant headroom for AIA to grow in Mainland China. We continue to deepen our reach within our established geographies of Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Shenzhen where just 3% of our target base of 140 million are existing AIA customers. Since 2019, we have established branches in five additional regions, bringing a further 100 million accessible customers within our reach. We are rapidly growing these operations and, in 2024, we launched in three new major cities in Sichuan and Hubei provinces. As we replicate our premier agency model in these recently established geographies, growth remains strong with VONB up by 27%. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we received approvals for four new branches in Anhui, Shandong, Chongqing and Zhejiang. These add another 100 million to our addressable market and all four regions have now received approval to commence operations. As you can see, our geographical expansion has more than doubled our target customers to over 340 million across 14 geographies in Mainland China. We are still in the early stages of replicating our platform and I am confident that AIA's scalable model ensures that we will capitalize on growth opportunities while maintaining our business resilience through changing economic conditions. Turning now to ASEAN, where AIA is the leading life and health insurer. This region is an important growth engine and generated more than one third of the group's VONB. In aggregate, ASEAN delivered over $1.7 billion of VONB in 2024, up 15%. Our performance was broad-based with double-digit growth from Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia and the other ASEAN operations grew by 30%. Across ASEAN, AIA's powerful multi-channel distribution is exceptionally placed to meet the growing customer needs across the region. We have the world's leading agency and our long-term strategic partnerships are a key asset, helping AIA bridge the huge protection gap for a growing population of more than 600 million people. Finally, onto our joint venture in India, Tata AIA Life. As you will recall, new business in the first quarter of 2023 was distorted by strong sales ahead of personal tax changes. VONB was up by over 20% excluding the first quarter of 2024 and reported VONB growth was still positive with this tax effect. Our leading agency contributes more than half of our VONB and we are the most productive in the market. We were again the number one MDRT company and our focus on agency quality has delivered consistent outperformance compared with the industry. Our agency is complemented by high-quality bank and broker partners extending our customer reach. Through its multi-distribution platform, Tata AIA Life has cemented its position as the market leader in retail protection. We also rank number one for persistency and we are the third largest private life insurer in the industry. Our protection-focused strategy, quality distribution and proven execution ensure that Tata AIA Life is well on its way to capturing India's vast potential. Today's excellent results are the outcome of executing a clear growth strategy that plays to our core strengths. We are uniquely positioned in Asia, the world's most dynamic insurance market and the fastest growing region globally. Our focus is clear, capturing the immense opportunities from rising populations, increasing wealth and an ageing demographic, with limited social welfare coverage. Despite strong economic expansion, private insurance remains low, driving an urgent and growing demand for quality life and health insurance. AIA is at the forefront of meeting these evolving needs backed by the right products, services and distribution capabilities. In 2024, we welcomed over 2 million new customers to AIA and repeat sales within our existing customer base grew by 15% as we continue to nurture long-term relationships through professional advice and best-in-class service. Our integrated product ecosystems are a key differentiator, empowering consumers to achieve their financial security, health, and wellness goals in ways that are more relevant, personalized and impactful than ever before. At the core of our success is AIA's highly-productive and growing distribution platform, bringing unrivalled expertise and a scalable way to address individual customer needs with compelling propositions. These strengths enable us to generate high-quality new business, deliver sustainable earnings growth and generate strong surplus cash flows, creating long-term value for shareholders. The execution of our strategy is powered by market-leading technology, digital capabilities and advanced analytics that enhance efficiency, scalability and customer engagement. Modern infrastructure, applications and high automation accelerate the adoption of digital tools and emerging technologies, boosting productivity while strengthening risk management. Rich and structured data provides the foundation for deploying advanced analytics and AI, enabling better decision-making and deeper insights. Our investment in TDA has already achieved recurring expense and claims efficiencies of more than $180 million. Digital tools power our unrivalled distribution, expanding our reach and bringing high quality advice and services across Asia. More than 21 million customers actively engage with AIA through digital channels, including AIA+, our flagship customer app, contributing to higher Net Promoter Scores. Amplify Health achieved major milestones in 2024 including the launch of AI powered solutions, transforming health claims management, payment integrity and provider management, reinforcing our Integrated Healthcare Strategy. AIA has invested heavily in foundational technology upgrades, process optimization and data integrity, ensuring that, as we integrate AI, it delivers maximum impact and seamless functionality across the business. I firmly believe that Gen AI will reshape the future of insurance, achieving better outcomes for customers, agents and our business. To date, we have already deployed over 50 use cases and we are realizing significant gains in key parts of our operations. In distribution, our AI-driven training tool simulates real customer interactions, sharpening our agents' engagement skills and boosting productivity. In our contact centers, AI-powered co-pilots summarize customer enquiries, reducing response times by over 50% and streamlining service. Gen AI document processing cuts review times in half, enhancing both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. More than 3,000 software developers benefit from our proprietary software engineering AI platform, reducing development time by 55% and accelerating speed to market. Our investment in Gen AI is not just about operational efficiency, it's about delivering substantial benefits across the business, building on the significant claims savings and productivity uplifts already achieved through our TDA program. I am confident that our continued expansion of Gen AI will strengthen our market leadership and accelerate AIA's growth strategy in the years ahead. In closing, today's financial performance reiterates our confidence in AIA's strategy and business model. With our clear priorities and strong competitive advantages, we are well-placed to fully capture the immense opportunities ahead. Our excellent VONB growth builds on the momentum generated in prior years, with successive layers of profitable new business, growing our large stock of future earnings and delivering future cash to shareholders. AIA's enhanced capital management policy and OPAT per share growth target introduced in 2024 reflect both our ambition and our proven ability to execute. Importantly, our financial flexibility provides the resilience to navigate market challenges and support long-term value creation. I am certain that AIA is exceptionally well-positioned to achieve our objectives in 2025 and beyond. Thank you.\nGarth Jones : Good morning, everyone. I'll now take you through the highlights of our financial performance. As you've heard, AIA has delivered an excellent set of results across growth, earnings, and capital and cash. VONB was up 18% to a record $4.7 billion, which drove EV operating profit to more than $10 billion and Operating ROEV up to 14.9%. EV equity increased by 9% per share and ended the year at $71.6 billion after we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders. OPAT grew by 12% per share, supporting an increase in operating ROE of 130 basis points and comprehensive equity of $87.6 billion was up 10% per share. UFSG, our key operating measure of cash generation, increased by 10% per share. Given these excellent results, the Board has recommended a 10% increase in the final dividend per share. The Board has also announced a new share buyback of $1.6 billion, following our capital management policy. This increased dividend and new share buyback reflects our confidence in the future prospects of the group. Let me now take you through more details beginning with growth. Our excellent VONB performance, with 18% growth overall, was driven by double-digit increases across all of our reportable segments. Hong Kong delivered 23% VONB growth to a record $1.8 billion. AIA China was up 20% from growth in active agents, a step-up in bancassurance VONB, and a 4.9 percentage point increase in VONB margin. I would remind you that, in the first quarter of 2024, AIA China saw 38% growth, which is a very high comparative for the first quarter of this year. And as Yuan Siong mentioned, our agency has successfully shifted the vast majority of our new business savings portfolio to par products. While the reported VONB margin for par products is lower, they are more resilient to lower interest rates, and we expect AIA China's VONB margin to remain over 50% in the first quarter. Thailand grew VONB by 15% to $816 million, driven by both our market-leading agency and our strategic partnership with Bangkok Bank. AIA Singapore was also up by 15%, with strong performances across both our agency and partnership channels, while Malaysia was 10% higher. Other markets grew by 18% to $467 million, with all markets delivering positive growth and Tata AIA Life contributing more than a quarter of the total. Our new business generates attractive returns, with an IRR on capital invested consistently above 20% and short payback periods. We delivered improvements in new business capital efficiency and higher margins overall, supported by a more favorable product mix and repricing actions. Overall, PVNBP margin increased to 11% and VONB margin grew to 54.5%. Our ability to write large-scale, high-quality, and profitable new business, with a very attractive financial profile, is a key differentiator for AIA and a major factor in our confidence in the group's future growth. EV operating profit per share grew by 19%. The increase in operating profit included $700 million of VONB, above the 2023 level. Operating variances improved by $171 million, supported by disciplined expense control, improved persistency variances and our proactive medical business management. Since IPO, we have achieved positive operating variances every single year and, in total, these have added $4.1 billion to EV equity, demonstrating the ongoing prudence in our assumptions. Together with a higher expected return that reflects higher US interest rates, EV operating profit exceeded $10 billion for the first time. EV operating profit is a key driver of the increase in EV equity over the year and resulted in a 200 basis points increase in operating return on EV to 14.9%. Investment return variances were small, as favorable equity market movements broadly offset lower Chinese and Thai interest rates. Currency translation into a stronger US dollar for reporting purposes and other non-operating items reduced EV equity by $2 billion. After returns to shareholders through dividends and share buyback, EV equity finished the year at $71.6 billion, up 9% per share. A direct result of AIA's financial discipline is our resilience to market movements. As you can see on the left hand side, embedded value sensitivities to equity and interest rate movements remained small for the Group. And for AIA China, a further 50 basis point reduction in Chinese Government Bond yields is just 0.8% reduction to the group EV. I'll now explain the prudence within our EV methodology, as it is important to understand some crucial differences when comparing with peers. First, we use actual yields to maturity on existing fixed income assets. This is in line with how we invest in practice using an ALM-driven investment strategy and holding long-dated fixed income assets to match our insurance liabilities. The second difference is the treatment of new investments. Here the assumed yield varies according to when the investment is made. We start at current spot market rates in year one and grade over many years to our ultimate long-term assumption. This approach is applied across each of our businesses. For example, new investments into 10-year Chinese government bonds start at earning 1.68%, the current market spot yield. Only by year 30 do we invest at our long-term assumption of 2.7% and we have reduced this assumption by 80 basis points at the end of 2024. An important point to note is that, after reflecting current market conditions and assumption changes, and post remittances to the group, AIA China's EV continued to grow in 2024. We believe this prudent and realistic approach sets AIA apart from the industry and provides confidence in the robustness of our VONB and embedded value. Now moving to IFRS earnings. Operating profit after tax was up 12% per share. The main driver of this was the 12% increase in the insurance service result. The CSM release was up by 7% to $5.6 billion, reflecting the compounding of large scale profitable new business each year. Operating variances improved by $172 million, benefitting from management actions on our medical business. Adjusting for the impact of the share buyback, the net investment result increased by 6% on an underlying basis. Other revenue and expenses, including finance costs, remained broadly stable compared with 2023. Overall, operating margin remained strong at 16%. The contractual service margin represents our stock of expected future IFRS earnings. This growth in CSM came from $7.7 billion added by new business and $2.8 billion from expected return on in-force. The CSM release rate was stable at 9.4%, with the resulting CSM release up by 7%, providing a $5.6 billion contribution to OPAT. Variances and others were mainly driven by the effect of higher US interest rates on our Hong Kong participating business, and some modelling refinements. Exchange rates reflect the strengthening of our US dollar reporting currency relative to Asian currencies. Ending CSM was $56.2 billion, with a strong underlying growth rate of 9.1%. Shareholders' allocated equity remained broadly flat over the year as $6.5 billion in returns to shareholders balanced out our strong net profit. Higher OPAT helped drive a 130 basis points increase in operating ROE to 14.8%. Net Profit was slightly higher than OPAT at $6.8 billion, with a small impact from non-operating items. Comprehensive equity, which provides a more economic view of equity by including net CSM, increased to $87.6 billion, up by 10% per share. I have great confidence that we are on track to achieve our earnings target. As I said earlier, the strong new business performance in 2024 builds on the momentum from prior years and adds another substantial layer of recurring earnings to our in-force business and the CSM. Underlying CSM growth, after the release into earnings, was 9.1%. Combined with our effective management of the in-force portfolio, this supported strong growth in the insurance service result and OPAT per share, both up 12%. We've made an excellent start towards our three-year OPAT per share growth target. Our confidence in delivering this target is underpinned by our strong business fundamentals, consistent execution and financial discipline. Finally, turning to capital and cash. UFSG is our key operating measure of cash generation after tax and is shown before reinvestment in new business and central costs. There are four components that make up UFSG. First, $4.3 billion of expected distributable earnings from our large in-force book that delivers recurring releases year-on-year. Next is the expected return on assets backing free surplus and medium term notes, which added $1.4 billion. Third, the addition of new business further diversifies our in-force portfolio, leading to a reduction in reserves and required capital. This item recurs each year and increased broadly in line with VONB growth. Other operating variances improved by more than $350 million compared to 2023 levels due to effective management of our in-force business. Overall, UFSG grew to $6.3 billion, up by 10% per share in 2024. Over the next 10 years, our large in-force portfolio is expected to generate close to $47 billion of distributable earnings before allowing for any future new business. During 2024, the profitable new business we added supported an increase in the 10 year total of $3.7 billion. Since these projections are consistent with EV, they already reflect current market spot yields in Mainland China. The key driver of future UFSG growth is successive cohorts of profitable new business, adding to our large in-force book. You can see this on the right of the slide, as layers of profitable new business compound over time to drive UFSG growth. This is why VONB growth is such an important focus for AIA. The Group's financial position remained very strong with free surplus increasing by 19% over the year to $19 billion, before returns to shareholders. We reinvested $1.5 billion of UFSG into profitable new business, up by 17%. After deducting central costs, net free surplus generation was $4.0 billion. Investment return variances and other non-operating items include interest rate and foreign exchange movements as well as changes to regulatory capital requirements in South Korea. After returning $6.5 billion of capital to shareholders, closing free surplus was $12.6 billion. This is the first year that we have applied our enhanced capital management policy. The annual payout target based on net free surplus generation amounts to $3 billion for 2024. Based on our excellent financial performance, the Board has declared a 10% increase in the final dividend per share, which results in total dividends of $2.4 billion for the year. This leaves a balance of $600 million in the form of a share buyback. Following a review of our capital position, the Board has announced an additional $1 billion share buyback. In aggregate, this will result in $4 billion dollars returned to shareholders in respect of 2024's financial results. Our enhanced capital management policy introduced a shareholder view of the group's capital. Shareholder total capital resources comprises Free Surplus plus eligible debt and required capital, as stated in our EV report. Required capital includes the prescribed capital levels for our various businesses as set out by our regulators. Allowing for the new share buyback announced today, the pro forma free surplus was $10.3 billion and shareholder capital ratio was 223% at 31 December, comfortably above 200%. AIA's financial discipline and commitment to shareholder value creation set us apart. Our prudent, sustainable and progressive dividend policy has seen total dividend per share increase progressively over time to more than 5 times the 2011 level. And through proactive capital management, we have returned $12 billion in the form of share buyback since March 2022, reducing the share count by 11.7%. Over 2022 to 2024, through our capital management actions and dividends, we have returned a total $18.2 billion. In summary, the Group delivered an excellent financial performance in 2024 with double-digit growth in our key financial metrics. EV equity of $71.6 billion was up by 9% per share after returning $6.5 billion to shareholders, powered by VONB growth of 18%. Our performance in 2024 and AIA's unparalleled competitive advantages provide us with confidence in meeting our OPAT per share growth target. Operating returns increased with ROEV up to 14.9%, and ROE up to 14.8%. Our capital management policy delivers a total yield of 6% with a 10% increase in the final dividend per share and a new $1.6 billion share buyback. There are substantial opportunities for AIA to continue to deliver attractive returns for shareholders well into the future and I have every confidence that we will do so. Thank you.\nLance Burbidge: Good morning from AIA Central in Hong Kong, and welcome to our 2024 Annual Results Analyst briefing. I'm Lance Burbidge, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Together with me on stage, we have Lee Yuan Siong, our Group Chief Executive and President; Garth Jones, our Chief Financial Officer; and our Regional Chief Executives, Jacky Chan, Fisher Zhang, Hak Leh Tan and Leo Grepin, and last, but not least, our Group Technology Officer, Biswa Misra. We also have the other members of our group executive committee with us in the room. With that, we will now begin our Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Charles Zhou of UBS Securities.\nCharles Zhou: Congratulations. I think it's a very good results as expected, and OPAT is also well on track. So, I have three questions. First, it's about China. The reported value of new business growth was 20% last year, and on a like-for-like basis, what's the growth rate? Is this significantly higher? And also, with the strong growth in the past two years, what would be the sustainability? And I also noticed that you obtained four new licenses last year versus your target, about one to two licenses per year. What is the pace going forward? The second question. I want to talk about the technology. I think Yuan Siong just mentioned about that one during the presentation. So, what is your technology, especially AI CapEx over the past three to five years? And how much will your investment be for the next three to five years? And I think Yuan Siong mentioned about the AI use case is at 50? So, can you maybe elaborate this a little bit, and can you maybe also quantify the financial outcome and the ROI for tech investments? Lastly, I have a question for Garth. I know that your shareholder capital ratio is 236% at the end of last year, and I remember you showed a shareholder capital ratio of 242% pro forma in the first half results after the $3.1 billion buyback. I think the actual buyback in the second half of last year is smaller than $3.1 billion, and also the equity market was doing well in China and Thailand. So, what is causing this lower than expected ratio? I also noticed the required capital increased very rapidly. I think 12% half-on-half. What's the reason? And what caused this reduced free surplus.\nLee Yuan Siong: Okay, thank you, Charles for your three probing questions. First on China. China is a huge growth opportunity for AIA, and we are uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity. Our headroom for growth in the original five geographies, the new provincial operations and future new provinces is tremendous. Our differentiated model ensures that we are best placed to service the needs of affluent families in the major cities, and the demand for our products and services remain robust. I will hand over to Fisher, who is here with us today to elaborate.\nFisher Zhang: Regarding the like-for-like basis, I think as you already expected, it will be significantly higher than the current reporting basis of 20%. So that's the answer for the first question. You're talking about the growth potential, I think, again, Yuan Siong pointed out, we are quite confident in the long-term growth. Let me elaborate a little bit about the agent channel. For agency, as you can see from the result, our growth momentum, recruitment momentum is very good. Number of recruits increased by 18%. Number of active agents increased by 9%. I think it's quite sustainable. Normally, the recruitment is driven by three key things. If we talk about the supply, actually the supply is often from very good quality talent in Mainland China, is not an issue. The demand side, I think, is mainly driven by three key factors – the willingness of the leader, the capability of the leader, and the confidence of the leader. For willingness of the leader. I think we have a very young and energetic leader group. Our average age of the leader is only early 40. So that is a very demanding group. Secondly, for the capability of the leader, I think we are quite capable of leveraging our leading digital platform. As for the confidence of the leader, we give a very special focus on the new agent development. We have additional resources, additional capability building up for the new agent groups. The new agent development and the quality gradually are back to the pre-COVID level. So, in summary, we think our premier agency is well positioned in this market and has lots of the growth potential for AIA China. As for bancassurance, I think our model is a highly selective model. We cooperate with selected partners, focusing on the affluent and high net worth segment, leveraging our digital capability and also the customer relationship management capability. I think so far we have viewed a lot of new innovation in this channel. We saw early success, but it's still at early stage. I'm sure it has very high growth potential. So, that's about the two channels. I'm very confident we can deliver long-term sustainable growth. For the expansion, we are very pleased to have four new licenses in this year. I think there is a couple of factors. Number one, this is a good demonstration of the government to the high quality opening up. And number two, this is also the demonstration of the government's high recognition to AIA China. But I also want to point out, in 2023, there is suspension in the approval of the new, provincial license and also the subbranch in a certain period. I think that that's also one of the reasons we can have four new licenses in 2024. Our expectation of the expansion remains unchanged, one to two new provincial licenses per year.\nLee Yuan Siong: On your second question about technology and digital analytics, I recalled in my first term, we invested close to $1 billion in TDA, over and above normal technology spend. We delivered a cloud based, modernized, scalable, highly digital, and data-rich technology platform. The investment has paid dividends and delivered material benefits as we have reported previously. It is also essential for our next phase, which is to leverage AI and other new emerging technologies to transform our business. I'm excited about the potential benefits we can unlock through the use of this technology. I'll hand over to Biswa to elaborate.\nBiswa Misra: Firstly, I am happy and excited about how our significant TDA investments over the last four years have helped transformed our business. Our cloud adoption today is at 90%. Straight through processing over 85%. Same-day turnaround of transactions over 85%. The data richness and data availability has grown tenfold over the last four years, and we have delivered more than 330 analytics use cases over this period. All of this has also powered digital adoption of our platforms, and today we have 21 million members who are using our digital platforms. As a result of all this, we have provided excellent experience to our consumers, customers and distribution. Our number one NPS ranking in multiple markets, our average in-app rating for agents who use our platforms which is 4.7 on 5 are a testament to the deliberate focus that we have put on providing the world class experience using our powerful technology. On efficiency, we are realizing annual benefits to the tune of $180 million on claims and operational efficiencies. And as a result of this, our unit costs over the period of last four years have significantly reduced to the tune of 43%. This robust cloud infrastructure, high level of automation, performing platforms and huge quality data set that we have, sets us up to use the immense potential that generative AI presents. We moved seamlessly to the use of generative AI last year and today – we delivered more than 50 use cases – I'm just going to walk you through four select use cases, which will give you an idea of the breadth of usage of generative AI within AIA and the different facets of our business that we are looking to address using this potential power. The first one, we have used the Alibaba LLM to launch a personalized training tool for agents, which simulates customer interaction scenarios, enhancing the agents' customer engagement skills. And initial results show an uplift of 10 points on assessment scores for the agents who are using this tool. We have implemented customer servicing Copilot using OpenAI LLM, which helps our customer services representatives answer queries seamlessly and summarizing interactions, and we have seen a decrease in 50% in wrap up times. The third example. We have implemented an extraction solution for medical documents using again OpenAI LLM saving up to 55% time for claims assessors and underwriters while analyzing the documents that come through. Last, but not least, which is quite fascinating and useful. I mean, this is the DeepSeek revolution, that we all are on the cusp of. Actually, we have been using this since March 2024, the earlier version of DeepSeek. We have developed a proprietary software engineering platform using the earlier versions of DeepSeek and now migrated to R3, which significantly reduces our coding time and code review time by up to 55%. And you can imagine, Yuan Siong touched upon our massive investments on TDA, the workhorse of a lot of these systems and platforms that we have placed in over the years is a result of this significant benefits that we are seeing from these platforms. As you can see through this sprinkling of examples, our approach to implementing Generative AI spans across new business underwriting, claims and software development, and many other areas. Over the next three years, a significant part of our technology investment will be focused on embedding Generative AI across all aspects of our business and help us scale our business further.\nLee Yuan Siong: On capital, previously, we have clearly communicated our capital management framework. We have acted in accordance with this framework. Since 2022, we have returned over $18 billion to shareholders and bought back more than 11% of outstanding shares. We will continue to implement this framework. On your detailed questions, I'll hand over to Garth.\nGarth Jones: Clearly, the biggest change in the shareholder capital ratio was the buyback program that that reduced the ratio by 38 points, so that was the most significant. The rest of it was largely due to the required capital increase, as you noted. More than half of that is due to the increased new business and the increase was proportionate. So, that's part of it. And, obviously, on that new business, we are getting returns of over 20%. So it remains a very attractive investment. In the second half compared with the first half, there are some forex and interest rate differences that come through. That's probably where your numbers are a little different.\nOperator: The next question comes from MW Kim of J.P. Morgan.\nMW Kim: Congratulations on the good result. I have three questions. Firstly, on the company's enhanced capital management policy, I guess net free surplus generation has become a more important metric to wider stakeholders. Do you have any plans to adjust the weighting over short-term management KPIs to place a greater emphasis on the net free surplus generation? Secondly, the Hong Kong business continues to perform strongly. Could you elaborate on the potential implications of new guidance related to the par policies in Hong Kong, including GL34, for both for the industry and the company? Lastly, it appears that the India business is doing very well. However, we still lack separate disclosure for this segment. When can you expect to see the separate disclosure for the India operation, even without the composite license progress?\nLee Yuan Siong: On the question of net free surplus generation, now net free surplus generation is UFSG less new business investment. Clearly, in terms of new business investment, because of the attractive returns that we can generate from new business, clearly, I think our shareholders would appreciate if we invest more and more, even more in new business. So, the metric that we reflect in our incentive schemes is the UFSG for each year. And the UFSG metric is actually, in the STI, which is the short-term incentive program, and also incorporated in the LTI of the management. So, that shows the emphasis that we place on UFSG, and that is very aligned with the interests of our shareholders. Now on Hong Kong. I think in Hong Kong, we are the most respected insurance brand in Hong Kong. Our loyal customer base stays with us through their lifetimes because of the trust they have in our professional agents, and the advice they get from our professional agency force. And our premier agents in Hong Kong, we are the most professional. We've been MDRT for 22 years already. And in 2024, we delivered very strong growth both in the domestic and MCV segments. I'll hand over to Jacky to elaborate.\nJacky Chan: I'm very pleased to report that Hong Kong and Macau delivered a set of excellent result in the year 2024, VONB growth by 23%, and it's a broad-based growth across both the agency channel and the partnership distribution channel, and also broad-based growth across both domestic customer segment and the Mainland Chinese visitor customer segment. And as you know, AIA Hong Kong has been very innovative in rolling out leading innovative, long-term protection and long-term saving products for our customers. Most of their products sold in Hong Kong market, they are participating products. And you mentioned two recent guidance notes from the Insurance Authority. In fact, AIA Hong Kong, we are very supportive of those guidance notes. On the first one, it is about par product illustration guidelines, and it put a cap on Hong Kong dollar par product on the IRR to the customer at 6%. Non-Hong Kong dollar product, the cap is 6.5%. We are supportive, and we believe a healthy competition in the market actually is beneficial to the customer. And this par guideline product will be well implemented effective from July 1st, and we believe it has no major impact to the business. And in fact, as Hong Kong is selling majority US dollar product, we invest globally. Our product in Hong Kong remain very attractive with very flexible features and benefits to both domestic and MCV customers. As to the second guidance note which was, you mentioned, is GL34. In fact, AIA Hong Kong has been employing a very robust par product management policy well before this issuance of the guidelines GL34. We have clearly identified and also segregated asset investment for par product. We have been doing this for years, and we have a robust ALM on the par product. And we have also a very robust dividend and bonus declaration policy over the years. And we put policyholder reasonable expectation in an important principle in our policy. And we always give a very fair treatment of our customers. And over the years, our participating product dividend bonus fulfilment ratio has been on average between 90% to 110%. So we are well positioned to implement this GL34.\nLee Yuan Siong: On your third question, I think I just remind you, we have a diversified pan- Asian platform and our key growth markets are the best markets for life and health insurance, offering ample growth headroom at attractive new business returns. Our portfolio of businesses is well balanced with Hong Kong, which is USD based, as Jacky mentioned, contributing one third; Mainland China, one quarter; Southeast Asia, 35%; and India is growing rapidly. And I'll hand over to Leo to talk about India.\nLeo Grepin: As you've mentioned, we're very pleased with the performance of Tata AIA. As you know, we've got tremendous partnership with Tata Sons and that partnership has delivered very strong performance. Last year, we delivered growth in both ANP and VONB, and if you look at the last two year CAGR growth, Tata AIA delivered over 20% over that period in both ANP and VONB. That now places us as the third largest private insurer in India, and that's on the back of a strong strategy with multi distribution channel. Distribution, in particular, we've got a strong focus on our agency distribution, which is now the number one MDRT agency in the country. That's also complemented with very strong partnership distribution, where we are associated with the highest quality banks and brokers in the country. We're very pleased with that performance in terms of growth, but we've also got a very strong focus on quality. We've been focused on protection, in particular. And we now rank number one in the country in terms of retail sum assured across both public and private insurance companies. That's also resulted in very high persistency where we have the leading persistency in the country across four of five persistency cohorts. So, as you can see and as you've highlighted, very strong performance for Tata AIA, and we've got great confidence in the performance of that business going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Thomas Wang of Goldman Sachs.\nThomas Wang: A couple of questions. I think, first, if I can just follow up on that free surplus generation, there's a $1.3 billion negative investment return variances and other items. I think there's a few drivers that mentioned, Hong Kong MPF, Korea and China risk. Is it possible to give a little bit more color in terms of what the size of each of those factors that contributed to this $1.3 billion negative variance item. Second question, if I kind of looking forward to 2025 VONB growth, just thinking about how you calculate your VONB. This is mainly for Mainland China. My understanding is that the bond yield at December 31st will be used in the 2025, at least part of the 2025 VONB. How should we think about that? Is that going to be a headwind to VONB growth just because of the way it's calculated?\nGarth Jones: On the free surplus, there's a reduction because of the Chinese and Thai interest rates. That's about $1.5 billion. And then there's equities. Performance was strong actually. And the strong equity performance is about half a billion the other way. And then there was the regulatory changes in Korea. They updated the ICS factors. That's about $200 million. Then there's some FX effects which is the balance.\nLee Yuan Siong: On your question about China VONB growth. Before I hand over to Fisher, I just again reiterate that China presents a huge opportunity for AIA. I elaborated just now. I think any short term headwinds should be looked at, in the context of the huge opportunity for growth in the long-term that we have in China.\nFisher Zhang: I think, as Yuan Siong points out, we are very confident in the long-term sustainable growth. I think premier agency force, our target segment at the middle class and affluent, our leading digital technology, and also the geographical expansion opportunity, I think, make AIA China well-placed to capture the growth opportunity in Mainland China. So, considering the low interest rate, we have revised assumption for the 2025 VONB. And we also proactively reprice our product and shift our long-term saving to the participating product. I think with all of these, although there are some margin pressure, we are still very confident in our growth driver, growth potential, our unique agency, and also the complimentary bancassurance growth potential.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Xu of Morgan Stanley.\nRichard Xu: First of all on China, seems like the VONB growth has slowed a little bit. We've done our calculation. Obviously, there's probably a number of impacts in fourth quarter. Just wondering whether there is any breakdown or details on some of the basically fourth quarter trends in China. Going forward, obviously, there are a lot of opportunities, but just want to see, any of the headwinds are still going to be persist in first quarter? When do we expect some improvement from that on China? Secondly, maybe on Hong Kong a little bit, if there's any guidance on the competitive landscape at the moment? Obviously, AIA has continued to be doing well in Hong Kong, but competition continue to increase. What are some of the outlook maybe pricing as well as competitive landscape for Hong Kong in 2025?\nFisher Zhang: Talking about the last year, the fourth quarter, the second half, I think from the reporting basis, so you may notice it's a bit lower. I think a couple of factors. Firstly, it's because, in 2023, there was a surge of business because of the first round of the PIR cut. But in 2024, we early withdraw the product trying to avoid those unhealthy fire sale. So, secondly, it's also because, last year, the bancassurance contributed a lot to the growth, but mainly, it comes in the first half which is in line with the market practice. And thirdly, I think very importantly in the second half, especially the fourth quarter, we shifted our focus to the customer acquisition, to the recruitment, and very importantly, train the agents sell more participating product, shift more to the par development. So, I think that's a key reason. Another reason is also we use a reported basis. If like-for-like basis, it will be more positive and it will look much better. So, that is about the fourth quarter in the last year. As for this year, the first quarter, as usual, we launched the jump start in last November, and also we began to receive the premium in January. I think for agency, the momentum is quite good. We maintained a good momentum in both sales and recruitment. I think we maintain our well balanced product strategy. Our strategy actually is to fulfill the customer needs at the different life stages. So, we sell protection, we sell the tax incentive products, and also the long-term savings. But in the jump start stage, our top priority is still try to shift to more participating products in the long-term savings. So, so far, the momentum is quite good. For bancassurance, we saw the increased competition in the market because of the relaxation of the 1 to 3, and also the increase emphasis from the competitors in the bancassurance. Please note, we obviously said, we are not managing the business quarter by quarter. We manage the business in the long-term view. As we said, we have full confidence in the long-term potential of the China market. And we think, AIA China is well positioned to capture the great opportunity in Mainland China. And also, we have full confidence in delivering the long-term sustainable growth.\nJacky Chan: Richard, on your question on Hong Kong competition. Yes, this is a very competitive market, but I have to say, AIA always welcomes competition if it really works out beneficial to the customers. And therefore, at the same time, AIA always employs sound financial discipline. And let me address this competition through the channel lens. Because in AIA, we are always very proud of our premier agency. AIA Hong Kong and Macau is a good example. We are MDRT number one in the last 22 years out of 24 years. And we have very high-quality agents. You can see our MCV business growth since the border reopened. It grows quarter by quarter. And our premier well-trained professional agency force is a key differentiation for AIA Hong Kong to address the competition issue. And our partnership channel also grew by 25% in the year 2024. And we have very good exclusive bank partners, Citibank and BEA. Both of them actually achieved very excellent growth in last year. The IFA/broker channel might be the channel that are more open to competition because it is not proprietary, but you see we also delivered double-digit growth in our IFA/broker channel in last year. While it is very competitive in the broker channel, but AIA, as I said, we really want to write quality sustainable business. Therefore, we partner with selected brokers who really align with our way of quality business. We launch a more stringent compliance requirement, inviting MCV business from the broker channel. And those IFA/brokers partner with us, they employ/implement the same to ensure a quality business going forward. And we continue to employ our financial discipline in driving sustainable quality business. While, yes, there is competition, we continue to innovate our products and services, etc.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kailesh Mistry of HSBC.\nKailesh Mistry: The first one is on slide 31. Within the UFSG roll forward, there's a negative variance of $127 million. I think there was a positive 310 in the first half. So just wanted to understand what's happened there? Second question is on required capital, just a follow up from Charles' question. So in your model, is it fair to say that you assume a required capital growth rate of around 5% to 6%, given 13% growth this year, half of which was new business, half was market movements, basically? So just if you could confirm that. Third question is on the medical provision, how much of the $400 million is remaining at the end of this year? And then the last one, just coming back to Hong Kong if I may. Some of my colleagues internally and also some of the clients are very excited about the Hong Kong offshore market, in particular the wealth management flows, etc. Could you just talk about the type of business you're willing to not do and the business that you have raised your focus on, I guess, to sort of cover that point.\nGarth Jones: The $1.3 billion, Kailesh, is mainly due to the interest rate movements and equities, as I described earlier. And that impacts free surplus more than embedded value because you have the dollar for dollar in the free surplus. And then that money comes back, the required capital comes back. So it's the time value of money that you see in the embedded value. The second question was on UFSG, the 5% or 6%. I think that depends on the reserves, but typically they would be around that level. Some of that is the business that is participating and so on. It's not just guaranteed parts of the reserves and so on. And then you have the diversification benefit as well coming in, of course. So, I think you can sort of project that out based on the past history. That will give you a good idea of how that will move.\nLance Burbidge: I would look at these things on an annual basis rather than on the first half or second half split. There's some seasonality in the way things emerge, particularly in UFSG.\nGarth Jones: Yes. And that diversification benefit, really, you can see that's roughly proportionate to the new business. The required capital growth, again, we said that was due to the new business increase that you saw. The majority was due to the new business increase. Some of it was due to forex and interest rate movements. The majority was due to the increase in the new business. The medical provisions, we've used a substantial amount of the medical provisions. So, you saw that the experience and the variances improved over the year. It was broadly in line with what we expected. We did keep some back for Thailand where we saw an extended flu season. And a little bit for Malaysia given the regulatory movements, but the majority of it has been used as we expected, and is broadly in line with our expectations when we set the provision up.\nJacky Chan: Hong Kong obviously is an international financial hub. And of course, the wealth management business in Hong Kong is flourishing, so many high net worth customers who come to Hong Kong. In fact, AIA pioneer to launch our Club Alta and we established high net worth wealth center, and also a wellness center for our customers. So it is both health and wellness. And right now, we really are doing a lot of high net worth business. But we are only issuing onshore policies, meaning those policies are issued by AIA in Hong Kong. We continue to have our options open to review the development of this high net worth market. And also let me remind you, in fact, Singapore is also one of the major financial hub in Asia, and in Singapore, we are also writing a lot of high end policies.\nKailesh Mistry: Just one outstanding. On slide 31, I think it's the 4th column along, the minus $0.1 billion. That was the one that was plus $0.3 billion at the first half. Just trying to understand what moved in the second half there.\nLance Burbidge: I think that was my point that I was trying to say. Maybe I wasn't clear enough that you should look at this more on an annual basis rather than – because there's things like expenses that are quite seasonal between the first and the second half. So, we tend to have a positive expense variance in the first half that turned negative in the second half. So, quite a lot of that is actually that happening. So, if you look at it more over the year, that gives you a better impression as to what has been happening, and so the plus $355 million year-on-year is more about the improvement in managing the claims.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michelle Ma from Citi.\nMichelle Ma: I have three questions. And the first on China. China again. So, it's nice to have another four new licenses last year. So I wonder this is kind of non-COVID period new licenses, just wonder how will we handle those new regions differently to build up the team because we notice AIA China actually start to hire some top managers, top agents from some competitors and, just wondering, this time, any different to build up a new branch. So, this is the first question. The second question is on the way of thinking shareholders' view of capital. Because in the presentation, we basically have a static view, so we deduct the newly announced share buyback from last year's capital position. Just wondering whether this is too conservative because the new buyback will actually be conducted in 2025, and so there will be new free surplus generation in 2025. If we just use, like the end of the 2024 position to think about the capital position, it will be very low, like 223. But if we also consider the new generation during 2025, it should be much higher, so should we think about the shareholders capital from a more dynamic way. So, that's my second question to discuss with the management team. The third question is on the total shareholders' return. I think we already offer very generous shareholders return, $600 million already completed in buyback year-to-date, $1.6 billion newly added, and another $2.4 billion in terms of the dividends. So, my question is, given currently the trading valuation is already above 1 times P/EV, should we consider actually more dividend from here and less buyback, given some domestic funds, especially southbound funds, most of them, they value the dividend yield as a critical threshold for stock picking. So, if we all do it in the form of the dividend, that will bring our dividend yield like 5.5% which is really attractive. Just want to discuss the format of shareholders return to hear about management thoughts.\nLee Yuan Siong: On China one, I am not surprised. Now I want to just start off by saying that, myself and actually the whole group, the board of directors are very pleased with the fact that we received approvals for four new provinces in October last year, and also for the fact that we received approval to launch all four provinces within the first quarter of 2025. I think that is really in record time. So, we are very pleased with the local team led by Fisher in delivering this excellent result for us. Just a reminder that, since 2019, we have expanded our geography in China from five geographies, Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Shenzhen, now to 14 geographies. So, we are definitely very excited about opportunities there in China. And I hand over to Fisher to talk about how we are progressing when it comes to new operations.\nFisher Zhang: As Yuan Siong said, we are very pleased to get four new licenses. As you said, there was some disruption there in the COVID period. But after the COVID period, we saw very good progress in the new five regions. Normally, for the expansion, we see that there are three key success factors. The first one is a proven business model, which is our premier agency. I think we have quite a lot of successful stories and accumulate very good experience in the past two years, and actually we can leverage in our current very high-quality agency force. Just to give you some color, like in Zhejiang, quite a lot of our agent leaders in Jiangsu and in Shanghai are willing to refer their friends in Zhejiang, and some of them are actually from Zhejiang. They can consider to relocate back to Zhejiang. So, I think we are quite confident in this business model. We can definitely replicate the success in the new regions. And the second success factor is scalable operating model. Since subsidization in 2020, we have established two share service offices in Guangdong and in Jiangsu. They are working very well to support the nationwide operation, and you know in AIA China, we have leading digital technology. So, I think that is very helpful. The third one is a key, the talents. We need to have enough talents, fit our culture, understand our model, following our operating principle. I think that that's a key for their success. Since 2019, we have built a solid pipeline of the talents. So I think, to combine all these three key success factors, and also we have accumulated very good experience in the past years, for the five to establish new branches. We are very confident we can ensure the long-term success of the new BUs. By the way, we are also very strategic and disciplined in the pace of the development. We need to ensure, the initial staff, the first batch of the leaders and agents are very solid, adding that they are key for the future success. This is a quick introduction of our expansion.\nLee Yuan Siong: On your two questions around capital and shareholder return, we have communicated our capital management framework. We are implementing it. We've returned significant amounts of capital to shareholders over the past three years. We've improved our metrics significantly. Our return on equity has increased significantly, now close to 15%. We have also increased our final dividend per share to 10%. So, I'll hand over to Garth.\nGarth Jones: We set out the capital management policy, Michelle, as you know. And we target to return 75% of net free surplus generation. I think the other element of this really is the prudent, sustainable, progressive dividend policy that we have. You saw, again, a substantial increase in the final dividend, 10% increase, but I think it's also important to remember that we've increased the dividend during COVID. And you can see that progressively over the years, we've increased the dividend. So, it's not just about the level. It's the prospects for future growth in that dividend that, I think, are also very important. In terms of the yields, quite rightly you say 6%, and we think that's very compelling proposition for shareholders. In terms of the shareholder capital ratio, as we set out in the capital management policy, we expect that will reduce progressively over time due to the 75% of net free surplus generation, plus anything addition that we had above that. You saw the additional $1 billion of buyback that we announced today, so making $1.6 billion in total. We see tremendous growth opportunities for the business. Fisher has outlined the growth opportunities in China, but we have growth opportunities right across the portfolio. We saw that in the results in ASEAN, for example, very strong growth, and in India. So, we think that the prospects are very good and we don't want the business to ever be constrained in terms of its organic growth in particular. There is a slide in the appendix.\nLance Burbidge: This also goes back to one of Charles' questions on the movement in this shareholder capital ratio. We understand that it's hard to see, perhaps, from some of the disclosures. So slide 57 gives you the numerator and the denominator movements, and this hopefully confirms what we said earlier in terms of – it's actually the new business growth, the $1.3 billion, you can see in terms of the required capital at the bottom, and that you would expect to continue. And then don't forget that we hold currently 236% of it, so it gets multiplied in terms of how it impacts on the shareholder capital ratio. The generation of in-force capital is more than sufficient to cover that growth, as you can see, but that may be helpful in terms of understanding, and you can see that investment variance and other, which includes the interest rate movement and the FX across the year. So hopefully, that will answer more of your questions in terms of the movement, but come back to me and investor relations if you want any more on it.\nMichelle Ma: Also, on the format of the buyback versus dividend?\nGarth Jones: I think, importantly, Michelle, is we've targeted 75% of net free surplus generation. You've seen the dividend increase by 10%. and as I said, we increased the dividend during COVID at a faster rate than OPAT growth. I think it's not only about the level of dividend. It's also the prospects for future growth in the dividend that are important, and then we also have the additional buyback to top up. So in some ways, looking at 75% of net free surplus generation may be a more appropriate way to look at it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Chang of CGSI Securities.\nMichael Chang: I've got a few questions on my side. Firstly, appreciate the buyback program, the $1.6 billion. But taking a look at some of your peers, maybe investors are a bit greedy here. Some of your peers have announced reinsurance or potential spinoffs to return more capital to shareholders and capital management is clearly the flavor of the month. I was actually wondering, on a slightly different topic, for leverage ratios, because tier-2 debt is a component of your capital. What are your target leverage ratios? And in terms of your credit rating, how much are you willing to expand that. Say, if you were to do more on that front, whether more capital could be returned to shareholders? Second question is, while we appreciate that you do have a very strong confidence on the long-term outlook for Mainland China, I think it's fair to say that a lot of the global investors, of which AIA does have a fairly high mix of shareholders, some of them are probably a bit more uncertain about the outlook. So, as AIA did in the first quarter and the second quarter last year, which investors highly appreciated based on the share price reaction, would management feel confident about, say, giving more clarity into the future by giving outlook statements or at least target, say, like new business CSM growth rates or VONB growth rates like some of your peers do because that will actually help reduce uncertainties. The third one is possibly on the new business CSM because that grew by 11% year-on-year on a CER basis. VONB was up 18% year-on-year. Now we do appreciate that, obviously, these are different metrics. One is accounting, one is actuarial, different things that go into it, tax, critical illness and so on. But I try to actually understand why has it been consistently slower over the last one to two years compared to VONB growth and how should we think about this, if interest rates move or given where your product mix is shifting, say, in the case of Mainland China, more towards par. Does that mean we should, under such a situation, given those assumptions, therefore expect slower new business CSM versus VONB? And maybe just lastly, I think it was asked by Thomas indirectly just now, but insofar that Garth did say that, 1Q, very strong growth in Mainland China last year, so take that into account, when considering the near term prospects for Mainland China, Hong Kong also showed high growth, but it was seemingly only was that Mainland China was singled out as having a high base. One thing that's different about Mainland China is the assumption changes. So I know AIA will not disclose like-for-like, but in terms of setting expectations, how should we think about the assumption changes and how it by itself just impacts FY 2025 growth numbers for VONB.\nLee Yuan Siong: I think if I can summarize your first three questions. I think your first question is about target leverage ratio. Your second question is about whether we should be giving new business growth targets. And your third question is about the trajectory of new business CSM growth, so I'll just hand over to Garth to talk about it.\nGarth Jones: On leverage, clearly, we look at ways that we can optimize returns for shareholders on a long-term basis. We do look at our capital management, we do look at the structure of the balance sheet and so on, and we look to continue to optimize our balance sheet. We do have capacity and financial flexibility from the debt capacity we have. And clearly, if you look at our leverage ratios within our ratings, we could increase our leverage, but that also gives us great flexibility and we're very comfortable with the ratings where they are. So we continue to look at that on an ongoing basis. In terms of the new business CSM and so on, I think you should remember that the group business has a different CSM from the individual business because it's one year business and so on and that goes into PAA profits. As you know, we would broadly expect that they move in line with each other over time. And I think if you look at our target of 9% to 11% growth that we expect to meet or beat, particularly given the excellent performance in 2024, then there's a level of new business CSM growth that you might expect within that. In terms of China, the margin in China, we highlighted the strong new business growth in China in Q1 last year. In Q1 last year, China was around 40% of the value of new business. As was said earlier, we will be using our revised economic assumptions for China, going into Q1, and that will have an impact on margin. But we do expect our margins to be above 50% overall for Q1. So, hopefully, that gives you enough guidance.\nLee Yuan Siong: Again, I'd like to reiterate my point that at the beginning well, any short term headwinds, we should really look at it in the context of the tremendous growth opportunity that we see for AIA in Mainland China over the medium and long-term.\nOperator: The last question comes from Michael Li of BofA Securities.\nMichael Li: Three questions from me. The first question is about ASEAN markets. So we saw strong margin in Thailand. We saw strong volume growth in Singapore. So could you talk about your strategy on some other markets in ASEAN countries, whether you could follow the example of Thailand or the example of Singapore to boost the VONB growth in 2025 or 2026? Second question is about India. So we saw news about Tata AIA life. It's not keen to get listed in India. So any rationale you could explain to investors why you made this decision. And the third question is about the long-term outlook of the company growth. So, some investors say that AIA now is a 10% company, so everything is about 10% growth, OPAT, EV before buyback, EPS. So any kind of game changers or drivers that could make AIA a 15% growth in the next five years.\nTan Hak Leh: AIA Thailand continued to achieve excellent growth. In 2024, we achieved 15% VONB growth, supported by both our agency and bancassurance channels. As you're probably aware, we are the clear market leader in Thailand, we're number one in most major product lines, number one unit-linked, critical illness, health, corporate solution, and overall protection business. And because our focus on protection business, we are able to sustain the high margin while delivering valuable solutions to our customers. Our agency force is our single biggest distribution channel. Agency force grew by 17% last year, both in productivity gains as well as headcount, and the growth of our agency force in Thailand was supported by the excellent contribution from our financial advisor program, where the number of new recruits of FA increased by 21%, and we've been able to obtain number one MDRT position in Thailand every year since IPO. In addition, we also saw very strong growth from our strategy partner, Bangkok Bank, largely from the success of our more segmented approach in serving the large and diverse market segment of Bangkok Bank. With our strong track record of execution in Thailand, as well as our market leading distribution channel proposition and digital platform, we believe AIA Thailand is well placed to continue the growth into the future. Singapore, in 2024, achieved 15% growth supported by both agency and partnership channels. Our strategic focus in the wealth opportunity in Singapore contributed to very strong growth in long-term savings products in Singapore. However, our overall product mix remain diverse. Traditional product is our largest and growing product segment, accounting for about 41% of our VONB. Sales momentum in Singapore continued throughout the year, which is more than offset the lower overall portfolio margin. Singapore continues to grow our agency force very strongly. The number of new active recruits grew by 15%. The number one MDRT in Singapore for 10 years. And our focus on the affluent and high net worth segment through our partnership distribution has yielded a very strong growth in 2024. And we also retain our clear market leading position in the corporate solution business. So, as you can see, in each market, we always strive to deliver the best solution to the respective segment. In Singapore, we are seeing a lot more growth from the wealth segment, which has generated huge increase in ANP. While the margin has gone down in 2024, the VONB continued to grow very strongly. Whereas in Thailand, the opportunity for protection, especially critical illness, life protection and health protection remain extremely strong, and that continued to support the significantly higher VONB margin that we have in Thailand.\nLee Yuan Siong: I think it really reflects our very customer focused approach to our propositions development in our markets.\nLeo Grepin: On your question on India, what I would say simply is, obviously, we won't comment on market rumors, but as you know, we've got an outstanding partnership with Tata Sons that has delivered very strong performance for our joint venture, Tata AIA. And the partners are consistently reviewing all of our options to maximize shareholder value, and we will continue to do so in the future.\nLee Yuan Siong: On your final question regarding the growth prospects of AIA, I'll take this question. As I said, we are in the best region for life and health insurance globally. I think there's no better region to be in for life and health insurance than in the markets that we currently operate in. We are also in the best position with our quality sales force, our very differentiated model to capture the growth opportunities in this region. So, I really don't see that we are a 10% growth company.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks for everybody who participated on the call and for your questions. And if you have any follow ups, obviously, come through to investor relations during the day, and I think we'll see some of you later on today. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes AIA's 2024 annual results Q&A session. Thank you for your participation.",

      "transcript": "Lee Yuan Siong: Good morning and a warm welcome to AIA's annual results presentation. I am delighted to report that AIA has delivered an excellent financial performance in 2024. We achieved double-digit growth across our key metrics for new business, earnings and cash generation, demonstrating the benefits of our growth strategy. Let me now take you through the highlights. Value of new business was up by 18% to a record high of $4.7 billion, building on the strong momentum we have generated in previous years. EV equity increased to $71.6 billion, up by 9% per share after returning $6.5 billion to shareholders. Operating profit after tax also reached a record high, up by 12% per share, and underlying free surplus generation, our key operating measure of cash generation, grew by 10% per share. Following our capital management policy, the Board has recommended an increase of 10% in the final dividend per share and announced a new share buyback of $1.6 billion. As you can see, we are delivering profitable new business growth which is driving both strong earnings and cash flow generation. In this way, we create a virtuous circle, funding further capital investment in organic new business, growing our large stock of future earnings and delivering cash returns to shareholders. Premier agency is the main driver of profitable growth for the group, contributing 74% of our VONB. We have the world's leading agency, which has ranked number one globally by MDRT members for the last 10 years, and we hold the top position in nine markets. In 2024, agency delivered 16% VONB growth, driven by higher activity and productivity, combined with an increase in VONB margin. Recruitment was also up by 18% with positive growth across the vast majority of our markets. These strong results are the direct outcome of AIA's Premier Agency strategy, designed to enhance both customer satisfaction and agent performance. We attract high-quality and motivated individuals, equipping them with extensive training and leading digital tools to support their long-term career growth with AIA. A highly professional agency enables AIA to advise sophisticated and affluent customers on their more complex needs, improving customer experience and increasing demand for our services. In turn, this attracts more high-caliber agents to join AIA, creating a self-reinforcing cycle, contributing to our industry leadership and delivering high-quality new business growth at attractive returns for shareholders. This is what sets AIA apart. Our fast-growing profitable partnerships also present a valuable growth opportunity for AIA and our partners. In 2024, VONB was up by 28% to $1.3 billion driven by an excellent performance in bancassurance, which grew by 39%. We have a proven model of partnering with leading banks for the long-term, reflecting the aligned growth ambitions of both partners. Integrating AIA's leading technology enables us to run advanced analytics models that better target customers, making our professional insurance specialists even more productive. In this way, we drive long-term regular premium business with attractive margins and returns. As a result, over the last three years, VONB through our bancassurance channel has more than doubled, with an increase in margin to more than 40%. AIA's extensive network of high-quality strategic partners significantly extends our reach, creating opportunities to engage with more than 100 million target customers across Asia, providing a growing source of profitable new business. Our twin distribution engines drive growth across the Group and I will now take you through the highlights of our performance by market segment. AIA Hong Kong was again the largest contributor to the group's VONB in 2024, delivering a record $1.8 billion, up 23%. Demand was very strong across both domestic and Mainland Chinese visitor customer segments, with broadly equal VONB contributions from each, reflecting our diversified and growing customer base. AIA's Premier Agency is the leader in Hong Kong and Macau and our main source of new business in this market. The 23% increase in VONB from agency was supported by both growth in active agents and higher productivity. New recruits were up by 16% as we add greater capacity to meet the growing demand for AIA's products and services. Our agency also achieved strong sales from Mainland Chinese visitors, with the fourth quarter recording the highest VONB since cross-border travel resumed in early 2023. VONB from our partnerships grew by 25%, following double-digit growth in our bancassurance as well as IFA and broker channels. Overall, the combination of our leading distribution platform and attractive products keeps us well positioned for future growth in this important market. AIA China achieved 20% growth in VONB to over $1.2 billion, driven by higher volumes and profitability. Our ability to achieve substantial growth in a challenging local environment, marked by low interest rates, demonstrates the resilience of our strategy and the quality of our business model. AIA China's Premier Agency is the world leader in MDRT members and at the heart of our growth strategy. Our agents are highly professional with incomes double the industry average, enabling us to attract and retain the best candidates. As a result, new recruits grew by 18% and active agent numbers increased by 9%, demonstrating the health of our business. AIA is uniquely focused on meeting the needs of middle class and affluent customers in Mainland China, with professional advice and high-quality personalized products. Long-term customer relationships help sustain full-time careers for our agents and, in turn, help more customers to achieve their protection, long-term savings and retirement goals. This is demonstrated by our middle-class customers holding over six policies on average and a 9% increase in the number of new customers in 2024, providing additional future growth opportunities for our agency. Highly-selective bancassurance partnerships accelerate AIA China's growth and we delivered a significant uplift in new business and VONB margin in 2024. This was achieved through our focus on meeting the needs of the most affluent customers, with average case sizes above $20,000. Taken in combination with our world-leading Premier Agency, we have the right model to capture future value in this market. The high-quality new business that we are able to generate through our Premier Agency differentiates AIA in Mainland China. We have a well-balanced product mix with traditional protection delivering close to half of our agency VONB. Nearly all our agents sold a protection policy in 2024 and demand remains strong with a 26% year-on-year VONB increase. Protection is an essential part of financial planning and provides an important source of diversified earnings. AIA also leads the market in tax-incentivized products, targeted at affluent customers, and we broadened our range of products further during the year. By repricing our long-term savings products, withdrawing certain products early and shifting our focus towards participating products, we are proactively navigating the low-interest rate environment. In the first two months of the year, our agency has already successfully shifted the vast majority of our new business savings portfolio to par products, as shown here. These offer policyholders a higher expected return from a broader range of assets and are more resilient to interest rate movements. Our comprehensive suite of products, supported by a powerful ecosystem of value-added services and leveraging our distribution strength, enables us to deepen customer engagement, expand our potential customer base and drive long-term growth. And there is significant headroom for AIA to grow in Mainland China. We continue to deepen our reach within our established geographies of Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Shenzhen where just 3% of our target base of 140 million are existing AIA customers. Since 2019, we have established branches in five additional regions, bringing a further 100 million accessible customers within our reach. We are rapidly growing these operations and, in 2024, we launched in three new major cities in Sichuan and Hubei provinces. As we replicate our premier agency model in these recently established geographies, growth remains strong with VONB up by 27%. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we received approvals for four new branches in Anhui, Shandong, Chongqing and Zhejiang. These add another 100 million to our addressable market and all four regions have now received approval to commence operations. As you can see, our geographical expansion has more than doubled our target customers to over 340 million across 14 geographies in Mainland China. We are still in the early stages of replicating our platform and I am confident that AIA's scalable model ensures that we will capitalize on growth opportunities while maintaining our business resilience through changing economic conditions. Turning now to ASEAN, where AIA is the leading life and health insurer. This region is an important growth engine and generated more than one third of the group's VONB. In aggregate, ASEAN delivered over $1.7 billion of VONB in 2024, up 15%. Our performance was broad-based with double-digit growth from Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia and the other ASEAN operations grew by 30%. Across ASEAN, AIA's powerful multi-channel distribution is exceptionally placed to meet the growing customer needs across the region. We have the world's leading agency and our long-term strategic partnerships are a key asset, helping AIA bridge the huge protection gap for a growing population of more than 600 million people. Finally, onto our joint venture in India, Tata AIA Life. As you will recall, new business in the first quarter of 2023 was distorted by strong sales ahead of personal tax changes. VONB was up by over 20% excluding the first quarter of 2024 and reported VONB growth was still positive with this tax effect. Our leading agency contributes more than half of our VONB and we are the most productive in the market. We were again the number one MDRT company and our focus on agency quality has delivered consistent outperformance compared with the industry. Our agency is complemented by high-quality bank and broker partners extending our customer reach. Through its multi-distribution platform, Tata AIA Life has cemented its position as the market leader in retail protection. We also rank number one for persistency and we are the third largest private life insurer in the industry. Our protection-focused strategy, quality distribution and proven execution ensure that Tata AIA Life is well on its way to capturing India's vast potential. Today's excellent results are the outcome of executing a clear growth strategy that plays to our core strengths. We are uniquely positioned in Asia, the world's most dynamic insurance market and the fastest growing region globally. Our focus is clear, capturing the immense opportunities from rising populations, increasing wealth and an ageing demographic, with limited social welfare coverage. Despite strong economic expansion, private insurance remains low, driving an urgent and growing demand for quality life and health insurance. AIA is at the forefront of meeting these evolving needs backed by the right products, services and distribution capabilities. In 2024, we welcomed over 2 million new customers to AIA and repeat sales within our existing customer base grew by 15% as we continue to nurture long-term relationships through professional advice and best-in-class service. Our integrated product ecosystems are a key differentiator, empowering consumers to achieve their financial security, health, and wellness goals in ways that are more relevant, personalized and impactful than ever before. At the core of our success is AIA's highly-productive and growing distribution platform, bringing unrivalled expertise and a scalable way to address individual customer needs with compelling propositions. These strengths enable us to generate high-quality new business, deliver sustainable earnings growth and generate strong surplus cash flows, creating long-term value for shareholders. The execution of our strategy is powered by market-leading technology, digital capabilities and advanced analytics that enhance efficiency, scalability and customer engagement. Modern infrastructure, applications and high automation accelerate the adoption of digital tools and emerging technologies, boosting productivity while strengthening risk management. Rich and structured data provides the foundation for deploying advanced analytics and AI, enabling better decision-making and deeper insights. Our investment in TDA has already achieved recurring expense and claims efficiencies of more than $180 million. Digital tools power our unrivalled distribution, expanding our reach and bringing high quality advice and services across Asia. More than 21 million customers actively engage with AIA through digital channels, including AIA+, our flagship customer app, contributing to higher Net Promoter Scores. Amplify Health achieved major milestones in 2024 including the launch of AI powered solutions, transforming health claims management, payment integrity and provider management, reinforcing our Integrated Healthcare Strategy. AIA has invested heavily in foundational technology upgrades, process optimization and data integrity, ensuring that, as we integrate AI, it delivers maximum impact and seamless functionality across the business. I firmly believe that Gen AI will reshape the future of insurance, achieving better outcomes for customers, agents and our business. To date, we have already deployed over 50 use cases and we are realizing significant gains in key parts of our operations. In distribution, our AI-driven training tool simulates real customer interactions, sharpening our agents' engagement skills and boosting productivity. In our contact centers, AI-powered co-pilots summarize customer enquiries, reducing response times by over 50% and streamlining service. Gen AI document processing cuts review times in half, enhancing both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. More than 3,000 software developers benefit from our proprietary software engineering AI platform, reducing development time by 55% and accelerating speed to market. Our investment in Gen AI is not just about operational efficiency, it's about delivering substantial benefits across the business, building on the significant claims savings and productivity uplifts already achieved through our TDA program. I am confident that our continued expansion of Gen AI will strengthen our market leadership and accelerate AIA's growth strategy in the years ahead. In closing, today's financial performance reiterates our confidence in AIA's strategy and business model. With our clear priorities and strong competitive advantages, we are well-placed to fully capture the immense opportunities ahead. Our excellent VONB growth builds on the momentum generated in prior years, with successive layers of profitable new business, growing our large stock of future earnings and delivering future cash to shareholders. AIA's enhanced capital management policy and OPAT per share growth target introduced in 2024 reflect both our ambition and our proven ability to execute. Importantly, our financial flexibility provides the resilience to navigate market challenges and support long-term value creation. I am certain that AIA is exceptionally well-positioned to achieve our objectives in 2025 and beyond. Thank you.\nGarth Jones : Good morning, everyone. I'll now take you through the highlights of our financial performance. As you've heard, AIA has delivered an excellent set of results across growth, earnings, and capital and cash. VONB was up 18% to a record $4.7 billion, which drove EV operating profit to more than $10 billion and Operating ROEV up to 14.9%. EV equity increased by 9% per share and ended the year at $71.6 billion after we returned $6.5 billion to shareholders. OPAT grew by 12% per share, supporting an increase in operating ROE of 130 basis points and comprehensive equity of $87.6 billion was up 10% per share. UFSG, our key operating measure of cash generation, increased by 10% per share. Given these excellent results, the Board has recommended a 10% increase in the final dividend per share. The Board has also announced a new share buyback of $1.6 billion, following our capital management policy. This increased dividend and new share buyback reflects our confidence in the future prospects of the group. Let me now take you through more details beginning with growth. Our excellent VONB performance, with 18% growth overall, was driven by double-digit increases across all of our reportable segments. Hong Kong delivered 23% VONB growth to a record $1.8 billion. AIA China was up 20% from growth in active agents, a step-up in bancassurance VONB, and a 4.9 percentage point increase in VONB margin. I would remind you that, in the first quarter of 2024, AIA China saw 38% growth, which is a very high comparative for the first quarter of this year. And as Yuan Siong mentioned, our agency has successfully shifted the vast majority of our new business savings portfolio to par products. While the reported VONB margin for par products is lower, they are more resilient to lower interest rates, and we expect AIA China's VONB margin to remain over 50% in the first quarter. Thailand grew VONB by 15% to $816 million, driven by both our market-leading agency and our strategic partnership with Bangkok Bank. AIA Singapore was also up by 15%, with strong performances across both our agency and partnership channels, while Malaysia was 10% higher. Other markets grew by 18% to $467 million, with all markets delivering positive growth and Tata AIA Life contributing more than a quarter of the total. Our new business generates attractive returns, with an IRR on capital invested consistently above 20% and short payback periods. We delivered improvements in new business capital efficiency and higher margins overall, supported by a more favorable product mix and repricing actions. Overall, PVNBP margin increased to 11% and VONB margin grew to 54.5%. Our ability to write large-scale, high-quality, and profitable new business, with a very attractive financial profile, is a key differentiator for AIA and a major factor in our confidence in the group's future growth. EV operating profit per share grew by 19%. The increase in operating profit included $700 million of VONB, above the 2023 level. Operating variances improved by $171 million, supported by disciplined expense control, improved persistency variances and our proactive medical business management. Since IPO, we have achieved positive operating variances every single year and, in total, these have added $4.1 billion to EV equity, demonstrating the ongoing prudence in our assumptions. Together with a higher expected return that reflects higher US interest rates, EV operating profit exceeded $10 billion for the first time. EV operating profit is a key driver of the increase in EV equity over the year and resulted in a 200 basis points increase in operating return on EV to 14.9%. Investment return variances were small, as favorable equity market movements broadly offset lower Chinese and Thai interest rates. Currency translation into a stronger US dollar for reporting purposes and other non-operating items reduced EV equity by $2 billion. After returns to shareholders through dividends and share buyback, EV equity finished the year at $71.6 billion, up 9% per share. A direct result of AIA's financial discipline is our resilience to market movements. As you can see on the left hand side, embedded value sensitivities to equity and interest rate movements remained small for the Group. And for AIA China, a further 50 basis point reduction in Chinese Government Bond yields is just 0.8% reduction to the group EV. I'll now explain the prudence within our EV methodology, as it is important to understand some crucial differences when comparing with peers. First, we use actual yields to maturity on existing fixed income assets. This is in line with how we invest in practice using an ALM-driven investment strategy and holding long-dated fixed income assets to match our insurance liabilities. The second difference is the treatment of new investments. Here the assumed yield varies according to when the investment is made. We start at current spot market rates in year one and grade over many years to our ultimate long-term assumption. This approach is applied across each of our businesses. For example, new investments into 10-year Chinese government bonds start at earning 1.68%, the current market spot yield. Only by year 30 do we invest at our long-term assumption of 2.7% and we have reduced this assumption by 80 basis points at the end of 2024. An important point to note is that, after reflecting current market conditions and assumption changes, and post remittances to the group, AIA China's EV continued to grow in 2024. We believe this prudent and realistic approach sets AIA apart from the industry and provides confidence in the robustness of our VONB and embedded value. Now moving to IFRS earnings. Operating profit after tax was up 12% per share. The main driver of this was the 12% increase in the insurance service result. The CSM release was up by 7% to $5.6 billion, reflecting the compounding of large scale profitable new business each year. Operating variances improved by $172 million, benefitting from management actions on our medical business. Adjusting for the impact of the share buyback, the net investment result increased by 6% on an underlying basis. Other revenue and expenses, including finance costs, remained broadly stable compared with 2023. Overall, operating margin remained strong at 16%. The contractual service margin represents our stock of expected future IFRS earnings. This growth in CSM came from $7.7 billion added by new business and $2.8 billion from expected return on in-force. The CSM release rate was stable at 9.4%, with the resulting CSM release up by 7%, providing a $5.6 billion contribution to OPAT. Variances and others were mainly driven by the effect of higher US interest rates on our Hong Kong participating business, and some modelling refinements. Exchange rates reflect the strengthening of our US dollar reporting currency relative to Asian currencies. Ending CSM was $56.2 billion, with a strong underlying growth rate of 9.1%. Shareholders' allocated equity remained broadly flat over the year as $6.5 billion in returns to shareholders balanced out our strong net profit. Higher OPAT helped drive a 130 basis points increase in operating ROE to 14.8%. Net Profit was slightly higher than OPAT at $6.8 billion, with a small impact from non-operating items. Comprehensive equity, which provides a more economic view of equity by including net CSM, increased to $87.6 billion, up by 10% per share. I have great confidence that we are on track to achieve our earnings target. As I said earlier, the strong new business performance in 2024 builds on the momentum from prior years and adds another substantial layer of recurring earnings to our in-force business and the CSM. Underlying CSM growth, after the release into earnings, was 9.1%. Combined with our effective management of the in-force portfolio, this supported strong growth in the insurance service result and OPAT per share, both up 12%. We've made an excellent start towards our three-year OPAT per share growth target. Our confidence in delivering this target is underpinned by our strong business fundamentals, consistent execution and financial discipline. Finally, turning to capital and cash. UFSG is our key operating measure of cash generation after tax and is shown before reinvestment in new business and central costs. There are four components that make up UFSG. First, $4.3 billion of expected distributable earnings from our large in-force book that delivers recurring releases year-on-year. Next is the expected return on assets backing free surplus and medium term notes, which added $1.4 billion. Third, the addition of new business further diversifies our in-force portfolio, leading to a reduction in reserves and required capital. This item recurs each year and increased broadly in line with VONB growth. Other operating variances improved by more than $350 million compared to 2023 levels due to effective management of our in-force business. Overall, UFSG grew to $6.3 billion, up by 10% per share in 2024. Over the next 10 years, our large in-force portfolio is expected to generate close to $47 billion of distributable earnings before allowing for any future new business. During 2024, the profitable new business we added supported an increase in the 10 year total of $3.7 billion. Since these projections are consistent with EV, they already reflect current market spot yields in Mainland China. The key driver of future UFSG growth is successive cohorts of profitable new business, adding to our large in-force book. You can see this on the right of the slide, as layers of profitable new business compound over time to drive UFSG growth. This is why VONB growth is such an important focus for AIA. The Group's financial position remained very strong with free surplus increasing by 19% over the year to $19 billion, before returns to shareholders. We reinvested $1.5 billion of UFSG into profitable new business, up by 17%. After deducting central costs, net free surplus generation was $4.0 billion. Investment return variances and other non-operating items include interest rate and foreign exchange movements as well as changes to regulatory capital requirements in South Korea. After returning $6.5 billion of capital to shareholders, closing free surplus was $12.6 billion. This is the first year that we have applied our enhanced capital management policy. The annual payout target based on net free surplus generation amounts to $3 billion for 2024. Based on our excellent financial performance, the Board has declared a 10% increase in the final dividend per share, which results in total dividends of $2.4 billion for the year. This leaves a balance of $600 million in the form of a share buyback. Following a review of our capital position, the Board has announced an additional $1 billion share buyback. In aggregate, this will result in $4 billion dollars returned to shareholders in respect of 2024's financial results. Our enhanced capital management policy introduced a shareholder view of the group's capital. Shareholder total capital resources comprises Free Surplus plus eligible debt and required capital, as stated in our EV report. Required capital includes the prescribed capital levels for our various businesses as set out by our regulators. Allowing for the new share buyback announced today, the pro forma free surplus was $10.3 billion and shareholder capital ratio was 223% at 31 December, comfortably above 200%. AIA's financial discipline and commitment to shareholder value creation set us apart. Our prudent, sustainable and progressive dividend policy has seen total dividend per share increase progressively over time to more than 5 times the 2011 level. And through proactive capital management, we have returned $12 billion in the form of share buyback since March 2022, reducing the share count by 11.7%. Over 2022 to 2024, through our capital management actions and dividends, we have returned a total $18.2 billion. In summary, the Group delivered an excellent financial performance in 2024 with double-digit growth in our key financial metrics. EV equity of $71.6 billion was up by 9% per share after returning $6.5 billion to shareholders, powered by VONB growth of 18%. Our performance in 2024 and AIA's unparalleled competitive advantages provide us with confidence in meeting our OPAT per share growth target. Operating returns increased with ROEV up to 14.9%, and ROE up to 14.8%. Our capital management policy delivers a total yield of 6% with a 10% increase in the final dividend per share and a new $1.6 billion share buyback. There are substantial opportunities for AIA to continue to deliver attractive returns for shareholders well into the future and I have every confidence that we will do so. Thank you.\nLance Burbidge: Good morning from AIA Central in Hong Kong, and welcome to our 2024 Annual Results Analyst briefing. I'm Lance Burbidge, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Together with me on stage, we have Lee Yuan Siong, our Group Chief Executive and President; Garth Jones, our Chief Financial Officer; and our Regional Chief Executives, Jacky Chan, Fisher Zhang, Hak Leh Tan and Leo Grepin, and last, but not least, our Group Technology Officer, Biswa Misra. We also have the other members of our group executive committee with us in the room. With that, we will now begin our Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Charles Zhou of UBS Securities.\nCharles Zhou: Congratulations. I think it's a very good results as expected, and OPAT is also well on track. So, I have three questions. First, it's about China. The reported value of new business growth was 20% last year, and on a like-for-like basis, what's the growth rate? Is this significantly higher? And also, with the strong growth in the past two years, what would be the sustainability? And I also noticed that you obtained four new licenses last year versus your target, about one to two licenses per year. What is the pace going forward? The second question. I want to talk about the technology. I think Yuan Siong just mentioned about that one during the presentation. So, what is your technology, especially AI CapEx over the past three to five years? And how much will your investment be for the next three to five years? And I think Yuan Siong mentioned about the AI use case is at 50? So, can you maybe elaborate this a little bit, and can you maybe also quantify the financial outcome and the ROI for tech investments? Lastly, I have a question for Garth. I know that your shareholder capital ratio is 236% at the end of last year, and I remember you showed a shareholder capital ratio of 242% pro forma in the first half results after the $3.1 billion buyback. I think the actual buyback in the second half of last year is smaller than $3.1 billion, and also the equity market was doing well in China and Thailand. So, what is causing this lower than expected ratio? I also noticed the required capital increased very rapidly. I think 12% half-on-half. What's the reason? And what caused this reduced free surplus.\nLee Yuan Siong: Okay, thank you, Charles for your three probing questions. First on China. China is a huge growth opportunity for AIA, and we are uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity. Our headroom for growth in the original five geographies, the new provincial operations and future new provinces is tremendous. Our differentiated model ensures that we are best placed to service the needs of affluent families in the major cities, and the demand for our products and services remain robust. I will hand over to Fisher, who is here with us today to elaborate.\nFisher Zhang: Regarding the like-for-like basis, I think as you already expected, it will be significantly higher than the current reporting basis of 20%. So that's the answer for the first question. You're talking about the growth potential, I think, again, Yuan Siong pointed out, we are quite confident in the long-term growth. Let me elaborate a little bit about the agent channel. For agency, as you can see from the result, our growth momentum, recruitment momentum is very good. Number of recruits increased by 18%. Number of active agents increased by 9%. I think it's quite sustainable. Normally, the recruitment is driven by three key things. If we talk about the supply, actually the supply is often from very good quality talent in Mainland China, is not an issue. The demand side, I think, is mainly driven by three key factors – the willingness of the leader, the capability of the leader, and the confidence of the leader. For willingness of the leader. I think we have a very young and energetic leader group. Our average age of the leader is only early 40. So that is a very demanding group. Secondly, for the capability of the leader, I think we are quite capable of leveraging our leading digital platform. As for the confidence of the leader, we give a very special focus on the new agent development. We have additional resources, additional capability building up for the new agent groups. The new agent development and the quality gradually are back to the pre-COVID level. So, in summary, we think our premier agency is well positioned in this market and has lots of the growth potential for AIA China. As for bancassurance, I think our model is a highly selective model. We cooperate with selected partners, focusing on the affluent and high net worth segment, leveraging our digital capability and also the customer relationship management capability. I think so far we have viewed a lot of new innovation in this channel. We saw early success, but it's still at early stage. I'm sure it has very high growth potential. So, that's about the two channels. I'm very confident we can deliver long-term sustainable growth. For the expansion, we are very pleased to have four new licenses in this year. I think there is a couple of factors. Number one, this is a good demonstration of the government to the high quality opening up. And number two, this is also the demonstration of the government's high recognition to AIA China. But I also want to point out, in 2023, there is suspension in the approval of the new, provincial license and also the subbranch in a certain period. I think that that's also one of the reasons we can have four new licenses in 2024. Our expectation of the expansion remains unchanged, one to two new provincial licenses per year.\nLee Yuan Siong: On your second question about technology and digital analytics, I recalled in my first term, we invested close to $1 billion in TDA, over and above normal technology spend. We delivered a cloud based, modernized, scalable, highly digital, and data-rich technology platform. The investment has paid dividends and delivered material benefits as we have reported previously. It is also essential for our next phase, which is to leverage AI and other new emerging technologies to transform our business. I'm excited about the potential benefits we can unlock through the use of this technology. I'll hand over to Biswa to elaborate.\nBiswa Misra: Firstly, I am happy and excited about how our significant TDA investments over the last four years have helped transformed our business. Our cloud adoption today is at 90%. Straight through processing over 85%. Same-day turnaround of transactions over 85%. The data richness and data availability has grown tenfold over the last four years, and we have delivered more than 330 analytics use cases over this period. All of this has also powered digital adoption of our platforms, and today we have 21 million members who are using our digital platforms. As a result of all this, we have provided excellent experience to our consumers, customers and distribution. Our number one NPS ranking in multiple markets, our average in-app rating for agents who use our platforms which is 4.7 on 5 are a testament to the deliberate focus that we have put on providing the world class experience using our powerful technology. On efficiency, we are realizing annual benefits to the tune of $180 million on claims and operational efficiencies. And as a result of this, our unit costs over the period of last four years have significantly reduced to the tune of 43%. This robust cloud infrastructure, high level of automation, performing platforms and huge quality data set that we have, sets us up to use the immense potential that generative AI presents. We moved seamlessly to the use of generative AI last year and today – we delivered more than 50 use cases – I'm just going to walk you through four select use cases, which will give you an idea of the breadth of usage of generative AI within AIA and the different facets of our business that we are looking to address using this potential power. The first one, we have used the Alibaba LLM to launch a personalized training tool for agents, which simulates customer interaction scenarios, enhancing the agents' customer engagement skills. And initial results show an uplift of 10 points on assessment scores for the agents who are using this tool. We have implemented customer servicing Copilot using OpenAI LLM, which helps our customer services representatives answer queries seamlessly and summarizing interactions, and we have seen a decrease in 50% in wrap up times. The third example. We have implemented an extraction solution for medical documents using again OpenAI LLM saving up to 55% time for claims assessors and underwriters while analyzing the documents that come through. Last, but not least, which is quite fascinating and useful. I mean, this is the DeepSeek revolution, that we all are on the cusp of. Actually, we have been using this since March 2024, the earlier version of DeepSeek. We have developed a proprietary software engineering platform using the earlier versions of DeepSeek and now migrated to R3, which significantly reduces our coding time and code review time by up to 55%. And you can imagine, Yuan Siong touched upon our massive investments on TDA, the workhorse of a lot of these systems and platforms that we have placed in over the years is a result of this significant benefits that we are seeing from these platforms. As you can see through this sprinkling of examples, our approach to implementing Generative AI spans across new business underwriting, claims and software development, and many other areas. Over the next three years, a significant part of our technology investment will be focused on embedding Generative AI across all aspects of our business and help us scale our business further.\nLee Yuan Siong: On capital, previously, we have clearly communicated our capital management framework. We have acted in accordance with this framework. Since 2022, we have returned over $18 billion to shareholders and bought back more than 11% of outstanding shares. We will continue to implement this framework. On your detailed questions, I'll hand over to Garth.\nGarth Jones: Clearly, the biggest change in the shareholder capital ratio was the buyback program that that reduced the ratio by 38 points, so that was the most significant. The rest of it was largely due to the required capital increase, as you noted. More than half of that is due to the increased new business and the increase was proportionate. So, that's part of it. And, obviously, on that new business, we are getting returns of over 20%. So it remains a very attractive investment. In the second half compared with the first half, there are some forex and interest rate differences that come through. That's probably where your numbers are a little different.\nOperator: The next question comes from MW Kim of J.P. Morgan.\nMW Kim: Congratulations on the good result. I have three questions. Firstly, on the company's enhanced capital management policy, I guess net free surplus generation has become a more important metric to wider stakeholders. Do you have any plans to adjust the weighting over short-term management KPIs to place a greater emphasis on the net free surplus generation? Secondly, the Hong Kong business continues to perform strongly. Could you elaborate on the potential implications of new guidance related to the par policies in Hong Kong, including GL34, for both for the industry and the company? Lastly, it appears that the India business is doing very well. However, we still lack separate disclosure for this segment. When can you expect to see the separate disclosure for the India operation, even without the composite license progress?\nLee Yuan Siong: On the question of net free surplus generation, now net free surplus generation is UFSG less new business investment. Clearly, in terms of new business investment, because of the attractive returns that we can generate from new business, clearly, I think our shareholders would appreciate if we invest more and more, even more in new business. So, the metric that we reflect in our incentive schemes is the UFSG for each year. And the UFSG metric is actually, in the STI, which is the short-term incentive program, and also incorporated in the LTI of the management. So, that shows the emphasis that we place on UFSG, and that is very aligned with the interests of our shareholders. Now on Hong Kong. I think in Hong Kong, we are the most respected insurance brand in Hong Kong. Our loyal customer base stays with us through their lifetimes because of the trust they have in our professional agents, and the advice they get from our professional agency force. And our premier agents in Hong Kong, we are the most professional. We've been MDRT for 22 years already. And in 2024, we delivered very strong growth both in the domestic and MCV segments. I'll hand over to Jacky to elaborate.\nJacky Chan: I'm very pleased to report that Hong Kong and Macau delivered a set of excellent result in the year 2024, VONB growth by 23%, and it's a broad-based growth across both the agency channel and the partnership distribution channel, and also broad-based growth across both domestic customer segment and the Mainland Chinese visitor customer segment. And as you know, AIA Hong Kong has been very innovative in rolling out leading innovative, long-term protection and long-term saving products for our customers. Most of their products sold in Hong Kong market, they are participating products. And you mentioned two recent guidance notes from the Insurance Authority. In fact, AIA Hong Kong, we are very supportive of those guidance notes. On the first one, it is about par product illustration guidelines, and it put a cap on Hong Kong dollar par product on the IRR to the customer at 6%. Non-Hong Kong dollar product, the cap is 6.5%. We are supportive, and we believe a healthy competition in the market actually is beneficial to the customer. And this par guideline product will be well implemented effective from July 1st, and we believe it has no major impact to the business. And in fact, as Hong Kong is selling majority US dollar product, we invest globally. Our product in Hong Kong remain very attractive with very flexible features and benefits to both domestic and MCV customers. As to the second guidance note which was, you mentioned, is GL34. In fact, AIA Hong Kong has been employing a very robust par product management policy well before this issuance of the guidelines GL34. We have clearly identified and also segregated asset investment for par product. We have been doing this for years, and we have a robust ALM on the par product. And we have also a very robust dividend and bonus declaration policy over the years. And we put policyholder reasonable expectation in an important principle in our policy. And we always give a very fair treatment of our customers. And over the years, our participating product dividend bonus fulfilment ratio has been on average between 90% to 110%. So we are well positioned to implement this GL34.\nLee Yuan Siong: On your third question, I think I just remind you, we have a diversified pan- Asian platform and our key growth markets are the best markets for life and health insurance, offering ample growth headroom at attractive new business returns. Our portfolio of businesses is well balanced with Hong Kong, which is USD based, as Jacky mentioned, contributing one third; Mainland China, one quarter; Southeast Asia, 35%; and India is growing rapidly. And I'll hand over to Leo to talk about India.\nLeo Grepin: As you've mentioned, we're very pleased with the performance of Tata AIA. As you know, we've got tremendous partnership with Tata Sons and that partnership has delivered very strong performance. Last year, we delivered growth in both ANP and VONB, and if you look at the last two year CAGR growth, Tata AIA delivered over 20% over that period in both ANP and VONB. That now places us as the third largest private insurer in India, and that's on the back of a strong strategy with multi distribution channel. Distribution, in particular, we've got a strong focus on our agency distribution, which is now the number one MDRT agency in the country. That's also complemented with very strong partnership distribution, where we are associated with the highest quality banks and brokers in the country. We're very pleased with that performance in terms of growth, but we've also got a very strong focus on quality. We've been focused on protection, in particular. And we now rank number one in the country in terms of retail sum assured across both public and private insurance companies. That's also resulted in very high persistency where we have the leading persistency in the country across four of five persistency cohorts. So, as you can see and as you've highlighted, very strong performance for Tata AIA, and we've got great confidence in the performance of that business going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Thomas Wang of Goldman Sachs.\nThomas Wang: A couple of questions. I think, first, if I can just follow up on that free surplus generation, there's a $1.3 billion negative investment return variances and other items. I think there's a few drivers that mentioned, Hong Kong MPF, Korea and China risk. Is it possible to give a little bit more color in terms of what the size of each of those factors that contributed to this $1.3 billion negative variance item. Second question, if I kind of looking forward to 2025 VONB growth, just thinking about how you calculate your VONB. This is mainly for Mainland China. My understanding is that the bond yield at December 31st will be used in the 2025, at least part of the 2025 VONB. How should we think about that? Is that going to be a headwind to VONB growth just because of the way it's calculated?\nGarth Jones: On the free surplus, there's a reduction because of the Chinese and Thai interest rates. That's about $1.5 billion. And then there's equities. Performance was strong actually. And the strong equity performance is about half a billion the other way. And then there was the regulatory changes in Korea. They updated the ICS factors. That's about $200 million. Then there's some FX effects which is the balance.\nLee Yuan Siong: On your question about China VONB growth. Before I hand over to Fisher, I just again reiterate that China presents a huge opportunity for AIA. I elaborated just now. I think any short term headwinds should be looked at, in the context of the huge opportunity for growth in the long-term that we have in China.\nFisher Zhang: I think, as Yuan Siong points out, we are very confident in the long-term sustainable growth. I think premier agency force, our target segment at the middle class and affluent, our leading digital technology, and also the geographical expansion opportunity, I think, make AIA China well-placed to capture the growth opportunity in Mainland China. So, considering the low interest rate, we have revised assumption for the 2025 VONB. And we also proactively reprice our product and shift our long-term saving to the participating product. I think with all of these, although there are some margin pressure, we are still very confident in our growth driver, growth potential, our unique agency, and also the complimentary bancassurance growth potential.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Xu of Morgan Stanley.\nRichard Xu: First of all on China, seems like the VONB growth has slowed a little bit. We've done our calculation. Obviously, there's probably a number of impacts in fourth quarter. Just wondering whether there is any breakdown or details on some of the basically fourth quarter trends in China. Going forward, obviously, there are a lot of opportunities, but just want to see, any of the headwinds are still going to be persist in first quarter? When do we expect some improvement from that on China? Secondly, maybe on Hong Kong a little bit, if there's any guidance on the competitive landscape at the moment? Obviously, AIA has continued to be doing well in Hong Kong, but competition continue to increase. What are some of the outlook maybe pricing as well as competitive landscape for Hong Kong in 2025?\nFisher Zhang: Talking about the last year, the fourth quarter, the second half, I think from the reporting basis, so you may notice it's a bit lower. I think a couple of factors. Firstly, it's because, in 2023, there was a surge of business because of the first round of the PIR cut. But in 2024, we early withdraw the product trying to avoid those unhealthy fire sale. So, secondly, it's also because, last year, the bancassurance contributed a lot to the growth, but mainly, it comes in the first half which is in line with the market practice. And thirdly, I think very importantly in the second half, especially the fourth quarter, we shifted our focus to the customer acquisition, to the recruitment, and very importantly, train the agents sell more participating product, shift more to the par development. So, I think that's a key reason. Another reason is also we use a reported basis. If like-for-like basis, it will be more positive and it will look much better. So, that is about the fourth quarter in the last year. As for this year, the first quarter, as usual, we launched the jump start in last November, and also we began to receive the premium in January. I think for agency, the momentum is quite good. We maintained a good momentum in both sales and recruitment. I think we maintain our well balanced product strategy. Our strategy actually is to fulfill the customer needs at the different life stages. So, we sell protection, we sell the tax incentive products, and also the long-term savings. But in the jump start stage, our top priority is still try to shift to more participating products in the long-term savings. So, so far, the momentum is quite good. For bancassurance, we saw the increased competition in the market because of the relaxation of the 1 to 3, and also the increase emphasis from the competitors in the bancassurance. Please note, we obviously said, we are not managing the business quarter by quarter. We manage the business in the long-term view. As we said, we have full confidence in the long-term potential of the China market. And we think, AIA China is well positioned to capture the great opportunity in Mainland China. And also, we have full confidence in delivering the long-term sustainable growth.\nJacky Chan: Richard, on your question on Hong Kong competition. Yes, this is a very competitive market, but I have to say, AIA always welcomes competition if it really works out beneficial to the customers. And therefore, at the same time, AIA always employs sound financial discipline. And let me address this competition through the channel lens. Because in AIA, we are always very proud of our premier agency. AIA Hong Kong and Macau is a good example. We are MDRT number one in the last 22 years out of 24 years. And we have very high-quality agents. You can see our MCV business growth since the border reopened. It grows quarter by quarter. And our premier well-trained professional agency force is a key differentiation for AIA Hong Kong to address the competition issue. And our partnership channel also grew by 25% in the year 2024. And we have very good exclusive bank partners, Citibank and BEA. Both of them actually achieved very excellent growth in last year. The IFA/broker channel might be the channel that are more open to competition because it is not proprietary, but you see we also delivered double-digit growth in our IFA/broker channel in last year. While it is very competitive in the broker channel, but AIA, as I said, we really want to write quality sustainable business. Therefore, we partner with selected brokers who really align with our way of quality business. We launch a more stringent compliance requirement, inviting MCV business from the broker channel. And those IFA/brokers partner with us, they employ/implement the same to ensure a quality business going forward. And we continue to employ our financial discipline in driving sustainable quality business. While, yes, there is competition, we continue to innovate our products and services, etc.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kailesh Mistry of HSBC.\nKailesh Mistry: The first one is on slide 31. Within the UFSG roll forward, there's a negative variance of $127 million. I think there was a positive 310 in the first half. So just wanted to understand what's happened there? Second question is on required capital, just a follow up from Charles' question. So in your model, is it fair to say that you assume a required capital growth rate of around 5% to 6%, given 13% growth this year, half of which was new business, half was market movements, basically? So just if you could confirm that. Third question is on the medical provision, how much of the $400 million is remaining at the end of this year? And then the last one, just coming back to Hong Kong if I may. Some of my colleagues internally and also some of the clients are very excited about the Hong Kong offshore market, in particular the wealth management flows, etc. Could you just talk about the type of business you're willing to not do and the business that you have raised your focus on, I guess, to sort of cover that point.\nGarth Jones: The $1.3 billion, Kailesh, is mainly due to the interest rate movements and equities, as I described earlier. And that impacts free surplus more than embedded value because you have the dollar for dollar in the free surplus. And then that money comes back, the required capital comes back. So it's the time value of money that you see in the embedded value. The second question was on UFSG, the 5% or 6%. I think that depends on the reserves, but typically they would be around that level. Some of that is the business that is participating and so on. It's not just guaranteed parts of the reserves and so on. And then you have the diversification benefit as well coming in, of course. So, I think you can sort of project that out based on the past history. That will give you a good idea of how that will move.\nLance Burbidge: I would look at these things on an annual basis rather than on the first half or second half split. There's some seasonality in the way things emerge, particularly in UFSG.\nGarth Jones: Yes. And that diversification benefit, really, you can see that's roughly proportionate to the new business. The required capital growth, again, we said that was due to the new business increase that you saw. The majority was due to the new business increase. Some of it was due to forex and interest rate movements. The majority was due to the increase in the new business. The medical provisions, we've used a substantial amount of the medical provisions. So, you saw that the experience and the variances improved over the year. It was broadly in line with what we expected. We did keep some back for Thailand where we saw an extended flu season. And a little bit for Malaysia given the regulatory movements, but the majority of it has been used as we expected, and is broadly in line with our expectations when we set the provision up.\nJacky Chan: Hong Kong obviously is an international financial hub. And of course, the wealth management business in Hong Kong is flourishing, so many high net worth customers who come to Hong Kong. In fact, AIA pioneer to launch our Club Alta and we established high net worth wealth center, and also a wellness center for our customers. So it is both health and wellness. And right now, we really are doing a lot of high net worth business. But we are only issuing onshore policies, meaning those policies are issued by AIA in Hong Kong. We continue to have our options open to review the development of this high net worth market. And also let me remind you, in fact, Singapore is also one of the major financial hub in Asia, and in Singapore, we are also writing a lot of high end policies.\nKailesh Mistry: Just one outstanding. On slide 31, I think it's the 4th column along, the minus $0.1 billion. That was the one that was plus $0.3 billion at the first half. Just trying to understand what moved in the second half there.\nLance Burbidge: I think that was my point that I was trying to say. Maybe I wasn't clear enough that you should look at this more on an annual basis rather than – because there's things like expenses that are quite seasonal between the first and the second half. So, we tend to have a positive expense variance in the first half that turned negative in the second half. So, quite a lot of that is actually that happening. So, if you look at it more over the year, that gives you a better impression as to what has been happening, and so the plus $355 million year-on-year is more about the improvement in managing the claims.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michelle Ma from Citi.\nMichelle Ma: I have three questions. And the first on China. China again. So, it's nice to have another four new licenses last year. So I wonder this is kind of non-COVID period new licenses, just wonder how will we handle those new regions differently to build up the team because we notice AIA China actually start to hire some top managers, top agents from some competitors and, just wondering, this time, any different to build up a new branch. So, this is the first question. The second question is on the way of thinking shareholders' view of capital. Because in the presentation, we basically have a static view, so we deduct the newly announced share buyback from last year's capital position. Just wondering whether this is too conservative because the new buyback will actually be conducted in 2025, and so there will be new free surplus generation in 2025. If we just use, like the end of the 2024 position to think about the capital position, it will be very low, like 223. But if we also consider the new generation during 2025, it should be much higher, so should we think about the shareholders capital from a more dynamic way. So, that's my second question to discuss with the management team. The third question is on the total shareholders' return. I think we already offer very generous shareholders return, $600 million already completed in buyback year-to-date, $1.6 billion newly added, and another $2.4 billion in terms of the dividends. So, my question is, given currently the trading valuation is already above 1 times P/EV, should we consider actually more dividend from here and less buyback, given some domestic funds, especially southbound funds, most of them, they value the dividend yield as a critical threshold for stock picking. So, if we all do it in the form of the dividend, that will bring our dividend yield like 5.5% which is really attractive. Just want to discuss the format of shareholders return to hear about management thoughts.\nLee Yuan Siong: On China one, I am not surprised. Now I want to just start off by saying that, myself and actually the whole group, the board of directors are very pleased with the fact that we received approvals for four new provinces in October last year, and also for the fact that we received approval to launch all four provinces within the first quarter of 2025. I think that is really in record time. So, we are very pleased with the local team led by Fisher in delivering this excellent result for us. Just a reminder that, since 2019, we have expanded our geography in China from five geographies, Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Shenzhen, now to 14 geographies. So, we are definitely very excited about opportunities there in China. And I hand over to Fisher to talk about how we are progressing when it comes to new operations.\nFisher Zhang: As Yuan Siong said, we are very pleased to get four new licenses. As you said, there was some disruption there in the COVID period. But after the COVID period, we saw very good progress in the new five regions. Normally, for the expansion, we see that there are three key success factors. The first one is a proven business model, which is our premier agency. I think we have quite a lot of successful stories and accumulate very good experience in the past two years, and actually we can leverage in our current very high-quality agency force. Just to give you some color, like in Zhejiang, quite a lot of our agent leaders in Jiangsu and in Shanghai are willing to refer their friends in Zhejiang, and some of them are actually from Zhejiang. They can consider to relocate back to Zhejiang. So, I think we are quite confident in this business model. We can definitely replicate the success in the new regions. And the second success factor is scalable operating model. Since subsidization in 2020, we have established two share service offices in Guangdong and in Jiangsu. They are working very well to support the nationwide operation, and you know in AIA China, we have leading digital technology. So, I think that is very helpful. The third one is a key, the talents. We need to have enough talents, fit our culture, understand our model, following our operating principle. I think that that's a key for their success. Since 2019, we have built a solid pipeline of the talents. So I think, to combine all these three key success factors, and also we have accumulated very good experience in the past years, for the five to establish new branches. We are very confident we can ensure the long-term success of the new BUs. By the way, we are also very strategic and disciplined in the pace of the development. We need to ensure, the initial staff, the first batch of the leaders and agents are very solid, adding that they are key for the future success. This is a quick introduction of our expansion.\nLee Yuan Siong: On your two questions around capital and shareholder return, we have communicated our capital management framework. We are implementing it. We've returned significant amounts of capital to shareholders over the past three years. We've improved our metrics significantly. Our return on equity has increased significantly, now close to 15%. We have also increased our final dividend per share to 10%. So, I'll hand over to Garth.\nGarth Jones: We set out the capital management policy, Michelle, as you know. And we target to return 75% of net free surplus generation. I think the other element of this really is the prudent, sustainable, progressive dividend policy that we have. You saw, again, a substantial increase in the final dividend, 10% increase, but I think it's also important to remember that we've increased the dividend during COVID. And you can see that progressively over the years, we've increased the dividend. So, it's not just about the level. It's the prospects for future growth in that dividend that, I think, are also very important. In terms of the yields, quite rightly you say 6%, and we think that's very compelling proposition for shareholders. In terms of the shareholder capital ratio, as we set out in the capital management policy, we expect that will reduce progressively over time due to the 75% of net free surplus generation, plus anything addition that we had above that. You saw the additional $1 billion of buyback that we announced today, so making $1.6 billion in total. We see tremendous growth opportunities for the business. Fisher has outlined the growth opportunities in China, but we have growth opportunities right across the portfolio. We saw that in the results in ASEAN, for example, very strong growth, and in India. So, we think that the prospects are very good and we don't want the business to ever be constrained in terms of its organic growth in particular. There is a slide in the appendix.\nLance Burbidge: This also goes back to one of Charles' questions on the movement in this shareholder capital ratio. We understand that it's hard to see, perhaps, from some of the disclosures. So slide 57 gives you the numerator and the denominator movements, and this hopefully confirms what we said earlier in terms of – it's actually the new business growth, the $1.3 billion, you can see in terms of the required capital at the bottom, and that you would expect to continue. And then don't forget that we hold currently 236% of it, so it gets multiplied in terms of how it impacts on the shareholder capital ratio. The generation of in-force capital is more than sufficient to cover that growth, as you can see, but that may be helpful in terms of understanding, and you can see that investment variance and other, which includes the interest rate movement and the FX across the year. So hopefully, that will answer more of your questions in terms of the movement, but come back to me and investor relations if you want any more on it.\nMichelle Ma: Also, on the format of the buyback versus dividend?\nGarth Jones: I think, importantly, Michelle, is we've targeted 75% of net free surplus generation. You've seen the dividend increase by 10%. and as I said, we increased the dividend during COVID at a faster rate than OPAT growth. I think it's not only about the level of dividend. It's also the prospects for future growth in the dividend that are important, and then we also have the additional buyback to top up. So in some ways, looking at 75% of net free surplus generation may be a more appropriate way to look at it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Chang of CGSI Securities.\nMichael Chang: I've got a few questions on my side. Firstly, appreciate the buyback program, the $1.6 billion. But taking a look at some of your peers, maybe investors are a bit greedy here. Some of your peers have announced reinsurance or potential spinoffs to return more capital to shareholders and capital management is clearly the flavor of the month. I was actually wondering, on a slightly different topic, for leverage ratios, because tier-2 debt is a component of your capital. What are your target leverage ratios? And in terms of your credit rating, how much are you willing to expand that. Say, if you were to do more on that front, whether more capital could be returned to shareholders? Second question is, while we appreciate that you do have a very strong confidence on the long-term outlook for Mainland China, I think it's fair to say that a lot of the global investors, of which AIA does have a fairly high mix of shareholders, some of them are probably a bit more uncertain about the outlook. So, as AIA did in the first quarter and the second quarter last year, which investors highly appreciated based on the share price reaction, would management feel confident about, say, giving more clarity into the future by giving outlook statements or at least target, say, like new business CSM growth rates or VONB growth rates like some of your peers do because that will actually help reduce uncertainties. The third one is possibly on the new business CSM because that grew by 11% year-on-year on a CER basis. VONB was up 18% year-on-year. Now we do appreciate that, obviously, these are different metrics. One is accounting, one is actuarial, different things that go into it, tax, critical illness and so on. But I try to actually understand why has it been consistently slower over the last one to two years compared to VONB growth and how should we think about this, if interest rates move or given where your product mix is shifting, say, in the case of Mainland China, more towards par. Does that mean we should, under such a situation, given those assumptions, therefore expect slower new business CSM versus VONB? And maybe just lastly, I think it was asked by Thomas indirectly just now, but insofar that Garth did say that, 1Q, very strong growth in Mainland China last year, so take that into account, when considering the near term prospects for Mainland China, Hong Kong also showed high growth, but it was seemingly only was that Mainland China was singled out as having a high base. One thing that's different about Mainland China is the assumption changes. So I know AIA will not disclose like-for-like, but in terms of setting expectations, how should we think about the assumption changes and how it by itself just impacts FY 2025 growth numbers for VONB.\nLee Yuan Siong: I think if I can summarize your first three questions. I think your first question is about target leverage ratio. Your second question is about whether we should be giving new business growth targets. And your third question is about the trajectory of new business CSM growth, so I'll just hand over to Garth to talk about it.\nGarth Jones: On leverage, clearly, we look at ways that we can optimize returns for shareholders on a long-term basis. We do look at our capital management, we do look at the structure of the balance sheet and so on, and we look to continue to optimize our balance sheet. We do have capacity and financial flexibility from the debt capacity we have. And clearly, if you look at our leverage ratios within our ratings, we could increase our leverage, but that also gives us great flexibility and we're very comfortable with the ratings where they are. So we continue to look at that on an ongoing basis. In terms of the new business CSM and so on, I think you should remember that the group business has a different CSM from the individual business because it's one year business and so on and that goes into PAA profits. As you know, we would broadly expect that they move in line with each other over time. And I think if you look at our target of 9% to 11% growth that we expect to meet or beat, particularly given the excellent performance in 2024, then there's a level of new business CSM growth that you might expect within that. In terms of China, the margin in China, we highlighted the strong new business growth in China in Q1 last year. In Q1 last year, China was around 40% of the value of new business. As was said earlier, we will be using our revised economic assumptions for China, going into Q1, and that will have an impact on margin. But we do expect our margins to be above 50% overall for Q1. So, hopefully, that gives you enough guidance.\nLee Yuan Siong: Again, I'd like to reiterate my point that at the beginning well, any short term headwinds, we should really look at it in the context of the tremendous growth opportunity that we see for AIA in Mainland China over the medium and long-term.\nOperator: The last question comes from Michael Li of BofA Securities.\nMichael Li: Three questions from me. The first question is about ASEAN markets. So we saw strong margin in Thailand. We saw strong volume growth in Singapore. So could you talk about your strategy on some other markets in ASEAN countries, whether you could follow the example of Thailand or the example of Singapore to boost the VONB growth in 2025 or 2026? Second question is about India. So we saw news about Tata AIA life. It's not keen to get listed in India. So any rationale you could explain to investors why you made this decision. And the third question is about the long-term outlook of the company growth. So, some investors say that AIA now is a 10% company, so everything is about 10% growth, OPAT, EV before buyback, EPS. So any kind of game changers or drivers that could make AIA a 15% growth in the next five years.\nTan Hak Leh: AIA Thailand continued to achieve excellent growth. In 2024, we achieved 15% VONB growth, supported by both our agency and bancassurance channels. As you're probably aware, we are the clear market leader in Thailand, we're number one in most major product lines, number one unit-linked, critical illness, health, corporate solution, and overall protection business. And because our focus on protection business, we are able to sustain the high margin while delivering valuable solutions to our customers. Our agency force is our single biggest distribution channel. Agency force grew by 17% last year, both in productivity gains as well as headcount, and the growth of our agency force in Thailand was supported by the excellent contribution from our financial advisor program, where the number of new recruits of FA increased by 21%, and we've been able to obtain number one MDRT position in Thailand every year since IPO. In addition, we also saw very strong growth from our strategy partner, Bangkok Bank, largely from the success of our more segmented approach in serving the large and diverse market segment of Bangkok Bank. With our strong track record of execution in Thailand, as well as our market leading distribution channel proposition and digital platform, we believe AIA Thailand is well placed to continue the growth into the future. Singapore, in 2024, achieved 15% growth supported by both agency and partnership channels. Our strategic focus in the wealth opportunity in Singapore contributed to very strong growth in long-term savings products in Singapore. However, our overall product mix remain diverse. Traditional product is our largest and growing product segment, accounting for about 41% of our VONB. Sales momentum in Singapore continued throughout the year, which is more than offset the lower overall portfolio margin. Singapore continues to grow our agency force very strongly. The number of new active recruits grew by 15%. The number one MDRT in Singapore for 10 years. And our focus on the affluent and high net worth segment through our partnership distribution has yielded a very strong growth in 2024. And we also retain our clear market leading position in the corporate solution business. So, as you can see, in each market, we always strive to deliver the best solution to the respective segment. In Singapore, we are seeing a lot more growth from the wealth segment, which has generated huge increase in ANP. While the margin has gone down in 2024, the VONB continued to grow very strongly. Whereas in Thailand, the opportunity for protection, especially critical illness, life protection and health protection remain extremely strong, and that continued to support the significantly higher VONB margin that we have in Thailand.\nLee Yuan Siong: I think it really reflects our very customer focused approach to our propositions development in our markets.\nLeo Grepin: On your question on India, what I would say simply is, obviously, we won't comment on market rumors, but as you know, we've got an outstanding partnership with Tata Sons that has delivered very strong performance for our joint venture, Tata AIA. And the partners are consistently reviewing all of our options to maximize shareholder value, and we will continue to do so in the future.\nLee Yuan Siong: On your final question regarding the growth prospects of AIA, I'll take this question. As I said, we are in the best region for life and health insurance globally. I think there's no better region to be in for life and health insurance than in the markets that we currently operate in. We are also in the best position with our quality sales force, our very differentiated model to capture the growth opportunities in this region. So, I really don't see that we are a 10% growth company.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks for everybody who participated on the call and for your questions. And if you have any follow ups, obviously, come through to investor relations during the day, and I think we'll see some of you later on today. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes AIA's 2024 annual results Q&A session. Thank you for your participation.",

    "fullTranscript": "Lance Burbidge: Good morning from AIA Central in Hong Kong, and welcome to our 2024 Interim Results Analyst Briefing. I'm Lance Burbidge, Chief Investor Relations Officer for the AIA Group. With me on stage, I have Lee Yuan Siong, our Group Chief Executive and President; Garth Jones, our group Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 Regional Chief Executives: Jacky, Hak-Leh and Leo. Also in the room, I have other members of our Executive Committee, who can answer questions in case needed. With that, I will move over to our operator and open to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charles Zhou of UBS.\nCharles Zhou: Congratulations. I think it's a very strong set of results, not only about the value of new business, we are also glad to see 10% growth per share CR basis for OPAT and also the USFG. So I have 3 questions. The first question is related to OPAT and USFG, 10% growth CR per share basis in the first half. So what are the reasons and drivers behind? And I think for the first time, AIA also, we're glad to see that you provide us a double-digit guidance for the OPAT, 9% to 11% for the next 3 years. Can you maybe walk us through the drivers behind? And do you have any USFG guidance? That's the first question. Second question is related to China. I think previously, you said you have a target of 1 new branch per year, to open a new branch. Now it's already late August. Do we have any update for this year of new branch opening? And third question, we know in China, we are seeing falling rates. Equity market is also very challenging, macro environment is very challenging in Mainland China. How are you going to deal with this? Can you maybe answer it from both asset and liability? And if possible, can you also maybe give us some sensitivities or quantified impact?\nLee Yuan Siong : Okay. Thank you, Charles, for your question. I'll just kick off by saying, as you know, we are a long-term business. Each year, we write profitable new business and this new business generates future streams of earnings, which is very predictable. And actually add on profitable new business each year. We add on new layers of future earnings, and that actually is the primary driver of earnings growth. I'll hand over to Garth to talk about it in more detail.\nGarth Jones: Yes. Thanks for the question, Charles, and thanks for the congratulations. Again, a very strong performance, as you noted. We're very pleased with the performance, strong new business growth translating into earnings growth and UFSG growth, as you can see. As Yuan Siong just mentioned, the primary driver is the new business growth. You see that coming through the new business CSM that's been added, again, a substantial addition in the first half. and active management of the in-force book to ensure that the assumptions actually occur in practicing. Again, you saw positive variances in the first half that reflect that. I think the target reflects our confidence in the future and our confidence to deliver new business and to manage the in-force portfolio. If you look forward, we set a target of 9% to 11%. I should stress the 11% isn't a cap. And I should also stress that it also includes allowance for the BEPS 2.0, the global minimum tax, at the illustrated level that we've shown today. So with that, I think the UFSG drivers are similar. Obviously, UFSG reflects a shareholders' view and is free surplus generation, it's not earnings, but the drivers are similar new business and management of the in-force. And I think the slides we've shown you will give you some guidance as to how you might project that going forward.\nLee Yuan Siong : On your second question on the China new territories, I'd like to just say that I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making in terms of the performance of the new geographies that we entered. In fact, this year, I have visited Tianjin, I visited Seichuan, I visited Hubei province. And I'm very encouraged by what I saw. I think they are making very good progress in terms of growing the agency force. As for the progress with regards to new licenses, I'll hand over to Jacky.\nJacky Chan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. And Charles, I just want to begin by saying that we are very pleased with AIA China's very strong performance in the first half, 36% VONB growth. And the growth is broad-based across both existing and new geographies, we opened since year 2020, and across both agency and bancassurance channel as well as across both traditional protection and long-term savings products. And the reason why we are able to deliver strong growth in view of this, as you said, economic challenge in China, is because we focus on the middle income and above customer segment, and we have a differentiated premier professional agency force and the underlying driver of our agency. You see 11% growth in the number of active agents. We continue to grow our recruitment by 26%. And even our total agency manpower has grown in the first half. And as to the new geographies, the growth of 44% VONB is supported by 37% growth in number of active agents. We continue to have dialogue with the regulators in both Beijing and also the provincial bureau that we would like to open new license. And we are happy to say that the discussion has been very positive, and we continue to expect 1 or 2 new provincial license in a year.\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes. On your third question about the China interest rates and the macro environment, I'd just like to emphasize the fact that we've been in the region for more than 100 years. We have grown and built our business in the various markets and we have operated through many economic cycles. So managing the asset and liability is something that we do as part of our business. I'll hand over to Garth to talk more about how we are handling the asset and liability situation.\nGarth Jones: Thanks, Yuan Siong, thanks for the question, Charles. I think, obviously, we match our assets and liabilities as close as we can. That's part of our active A&L management. And when we look at the assets, the first thing we look at is the liabilities. We see that our assets are predominantly in government bonds and predominantly in long government bonds. And that means our assets and liabilities are matched as closely as it can be. And you see that in the embedded value sensitivities that we gave out earlier with just a 1% reduction if we move to spot. And if we move the rates down by 50 basis points, then you see a 4% reduction in the embedded value. I think that reflects the A&L management. On an ongoing basis, we obviously reprice and redesign our products. And as interest rates have come down in China, we have positioned the portfolio more towards participating products, in anticipation that if they move lower, we will again move more into participating products than the current product range.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Garth. And Charles, does that answer your questions?\nCharles Zhou: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Thomas Wang of Goldman Sachs.\nThomas Wang: A few questions from me. I think, firstly, on the OPAT per share target. So it's great to see management providing more medium-term target. Just want to clarify, how much sort of buyback and share count reduction have been reflected in that target? If we can sort of simply have maybe an OPAT growth CAGR, what's the underlying assumption of OPAT growth CAGR -- underlying that OPAT per share CAGR target? And secondly, on the CSM movements, what we see, there is a change in the new business CSM to [indiscernible] value multiple. So I think that comes down to roughly 1.5, 1.6 versus previous. I think a couple of years back at 1.9. I just want to get a sense of where this should land if we think about, say, 2 or 3 years down the line?\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes, Garth?\nGarth Jones: Yes. Yes, thanks. As far as the OPAT, we said the target was a per share CAGR. The reason for that, Thomas, is that part of the earnings is the earnings on the surplus capital. We will, obviously, as we go forward, following our new capital management policy, be providing returns to shareholders, both through dividends and through buybacks, and we will look at the position in terms of our shareholder capital ratio and so on, on an ongoing basis. So by using a per share metric, we're saying that, well, if we use the capital to buy back more shares, then clearly, the OPAT itself will reduce by the investment on that capital that per share will increase. So that's the reason for that. On the CSM, the new business CSM, again, as I said earlier, one is an earnings metric, one is a shareholder value metric and reflects not only the surplus that will be generated from the business but also the cost of the capital, full expenses and so on and uses much higher discount rates than the IFRS earnings. So they are quite different. I think the critical thing is that they're both very positive. And you can see that the new business CSM has added considerably to the existing CSM. And as you mentioned, the new business CSM is far above the value of new business at 1.5x. I think it was Lance that said it should remain stable. It does vary like product and geography. But I think the critical thing is that the new business CSM will add to the existing CSM and that's obviously reflected in our target that we gave out today.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Garth. Any question, Thomas?\nThomas Wang: Yes. Just maybe if we can sort of get a sense of what's the driver of the changes year-on-year on that new business sales, just the VONB multiple. As you said, it's product mix. Which geography or which product segment that was driving that change?\nGarth Jones: Yes, there are a sort of variety of factors within that, Thomas. It's perhaps easier to talk to Lance off-line about more of the detail. For example, if you look at the power and non-power products in China, they'll have different ratios and so on. So I think it's one of those things where it's better to look at it holistically and say, well, how does it look holistically and not lose sight of the bigger picture.\nLance Burbidge: Okay. Thanks, Thomas.\nOperator: The next question comes from MW Kim of JPMorgan.\nMW Kim: Congratulations on the very good results. I have two questions. One is about India. So as the company communicated, relatively weaker. The India new business value growth in first half was due to the last year's high base. That said, the business looks very big scare. If the India government would allow the company license in the foreseeable future, how would we think about the product margin outlook in India operation? And also would you share the possible timeline of a separate India business disclosure, please? The next question is about the CSM. If we assume that the bond yield starts to decline from here, would we have potentially the lower new business CSM margin multiple, especially for the whole life? And also under such a big and good new business CSM growth, is it reasonable to assume luckily the mid-single digit, the CSM balance growth outlook in the next few years?\nLee Yuan Siong : Thank you for your question on India. India is obviously one of our growth engines, it's an exciting opportunity, a very large market. We have strong presence. The business is performing very well. Our partnership with TATA, I think the relationship is excellent. We have a very high-quality business where the persistency impact is market-leading, and we are #3 in terms of the private insurance in India. So I'll hand over to Leo to talk about India a bit more.\nLeo Grepin: MW, thanks for your question on India. As Yuan Siong mentioned, the momentum is strong in India. If you look at the period April to June, following our one lag reported first half, which really covers October until March, where last year, we had a strong first quarter because of a change in tax regulation in India. We had comparable very strong last year. But the latest quarter that you've seen reported through industry disclosures was very strong, and TATA AIA was stronger than industry. So we see -- we continue to see very strong momentum, in particular, from our agency and then our strengthening partnership distribution partnerships. For example, we expanded IDFC and then added 2 new banca partnerships, so strong momentum. In terms of how this translates, if there's a change in regulation with the allowance of a composite license. I think there's still a lot of details to be figured out. This potential composite license has been in discussions now for a couple of years and has not come up yet for -- it's not been approved yet. The details of it also are changing quite a bit. So I think it's too early to really prognosticate on the impact that this would have on the industry dynamics or potential profit margins across the industry.\nLee Yuan Siong : Garth, on the CSM question.\nGarth Jones: Yes. On the CSM question, thanks, MW. I think I'd refer you to the financial and operating review, which has the sensitivities in for interest rate movements. For the non-participating business, that's largely locked in at issue. And then for the participating business, that flows through the CSM and is amortized. So you can see the sensitivities are small. As far as new business, clearly, we reprice and while the market consistent basis of the IFRS basis is more market consistent than the value of new business. Over time, that will fluctuate out. So I think the sensitivities are small is the key thing to think about. And new business, we can reprice and redesign and so on. And for India, I think it's a case of when it's big enough, so my challenge to Leo is to make it big enough.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, MW. Does that answer the question?\nMW Kim: Yes.\nLance Burbidge: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kailesh Mistry of HSBC. Kailesh, we cannot hear you.\nKailesh Mistry: There we go. Is that better?\nLance Burbidge: Yes.\nKailesh Mistry: Thank you also for the additional disclosure on free surplus disclosure on Slide 31 and 32. So I just wanted to clarify a couple of points. I guess just on the expected return, the base for that is the $14.5 billion free surplus plus $12 billion of medium term notes. On the diversification benefit, has that always trended around that $400 million number? Or how has it grown historically, just so I can think about how that goes forward. Operating variances, are they consistent with the EV operating variances? And then on Slide 32, the cash generation from the new business, I think, is the $3.4 billion number. Should we assume that breaks down into the 5-year bucket the same as the in-force for our projections? Secondly, moving on to OPAT. Obviously, the target is welcome. Just wanted to understand is the interest rate assumption as interest rates currently are? Or are you assuming something different in setting that target? So yes, those two, please?\nLee Yuan Siong : Garth, I guess, a question for you.\nGarth Jones: If I can remember all. Yes, the expected return on free surplus and assets backing MTNs is indeed as it says on the term. Now the diversification benefit from new business, that's something that occurs every year as we write new business, and it's broadly been similar to the value of new business. It clearly varies by product and by market, but it's been broadly similar to value of new business growth. For the rest of it, you asked about variances. Variances were similar, yes, I think, 0.3. They're still with -- it's EV, consistent with the EV and UFSG, they are effectively both on the same basis. And in terms of the buckets, I think you'll see each year how that adds going forward. And I think the critical thing here is that we've illustrated the DE from the in-force is relatively stable. And I think that's important.\nLee Yuan Siong : And the interest rate assumption on the OPAT target.\nGarth Jones: Yes. Obviously, it's framed in the current environment, but we have run a range of scenarios going forward, and we remain confident that the target that we've set can be met.\nLance Burbidge: Does that answer everything, Kailesh? Or did we miss something?\nKailesh Mistry: I think you answered it. I had one more that I forgot to ask, which is on the Hong Kong business. I guess two things. Firstly, I think it's the only one, if I haven't missed it, where you haven't talked about active agent growth or not. So if you could update us on that, that would be great. Secondly, on the offshore business, was the second quarter greater than the first quarter, which was greater than the quarters in the second half of last year, I think. And could you just update us on case sizes and protection versus savings mix, I think?\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes. I'll hand over to Jacky to talk about Hong Kong, but I just want to start by saying that I'm very pleased with the performance in Hong Kong because we saw very strong growth both from domestic and MCV segments.\nJacky Chan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. In fact, the Hong Kong growth is also driven by a very strong fundamentals of the Premier Agency in Hong Kong. Number of active agent growth and our new record also grew by 19%, so adding more active manpower to both domestic and the MCV customer segment. And as to the MCV, as you talked about on the second quarter, AIA Hong Kong have quarter-to-quarter growth, Q2 over last year Q2, double digit growth in VONB. And we continue to see a strong demand from the MCV customers. And in fact, our MCV customer number, new business in the first half continued to have a double-digit growth compared to last year first half. So we continue to see that strong demand of MCV offshore coming to Hong Kong remain unchanged.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Jacky. Thanks, Kailesh, for the questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Xu of Morgan Stanley.\nRichard Xu: Two questions from me. One is on China. Could you talk a little bit about the agent recruiting trends? Is the current environment actually better for agent recruitment given some of the challenges in China labor market at the moment? And what are the future plans? And then also on China, the product mix, could you talk a little bit on that as well? I mean it seems like both agents and products are the key contribution for the very impressive growth in China. So a little bit more color on that will be very helpful. And then secondly, on the other markets, you talk a little bit about India. [indiscernible] clearly as a whole, it was lagging other markets. Any outlook on that? And for example, Vietnam or other markets, will we see, in addition to India, what will they be rebounds in other markets?\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes. I'll hand over to Jacky to talk about the China recruitment and product mix. Like I say, after I visited China frequently and have many interactions with the local management plus the agency force. Very happy with the quality of the agency force. I think in terms of the quality of the recruitment, we are really very selective even in the new geographies, it was commented to me by external parties that we recruit agents as rigorous -- that the recruitment process for the new agent is as rigorous as the recruitment for full time employee in AIA.\nJacky Chan: Yes. Thank you, Yuan Siong. I just want to reiterate this because the differentiation of AIA China is really our premier full-time professional agency force. So as you say, oh, now it's a big economic challenge in Mainland China, but we continue to be highly selective or the new agent has to go through at least 3 rounds of interviews. And right now, our new recruit has growth of 26%, and in fact, more than 94% of those are new recruits. They have a college degree or above. So we really continue to focusing on increasing our quality and premium agent. And that's why you can see that we continue to drive a very strong growth of active agent from both the new recruit and also the existing agent. And as to the product, that is also closely related to our Premier Agency because we are targeting the middle income above customer segment, which more resilient under this so-called economic challenge environment. And in terms of the product mix, you can also see that in first half this year, we also diversify more towards participating product. And our Premier Agency is more than capable of able to explain this more complicated participating product to the customers. So in the first half, you can see that our product mix, as I said, we have double-digit growth on our traditional protection products as well as very strong growth from the long-term saving product. And as for the long-term saving product, we have diversified with participating long-term saving products. And our Premier Agency force also continued to sell quite a bit of those tax deductible personal pension benefit in the first half. That kind of retirement and personal pension benefit saving plan made up of roughly 25% of our new business in the first half. And I just want to let you know, in fact, in July this year, we continue to launch new products, which are tax deductible, which is a very welcome tax-deductible long-term care product, which in effect is a more [indiscernible] product. So this really reflects how our Premier Agency force targeting the affluent customer segment work very well in the current situation.\nLee Yuan Siong : On other markets, I think Leo explained just now about the temporary fluctuation to the strong growth in India as a result of the very high base in January to March last year due to the tax changes. But if you take out India, other markets actually grew by 21%. We all know in the past, we've talked about the challenges that in the Vietnam market, but we've seen good recovery momentum in our Vietnam market. At the same time, we are very pleased with the fact that we were able to extend our bancassurance partnership with BCA in Indonesia to 2038. So very encouraged by the performance of other markets. And as I said, India is a temporary fluctuation in the growth. That's very specific to India, yes.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Yuan Siong. Did That get all the questions you had there, Richard?\nRichard Xu: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michelle Ma of Citi.\nMichelle Ma: Big congrats on the results with literally no weakness on this set of results. I have two questions here. It's about Singapore and Thailand. For Singapore, actually, that's a true surprise for me, very strong growth of 27%. And as mentioned, the growth can be attributable to the growing wealth opportunities. So could you shed more light on this? So I wonder whether this very strong growth, whether there is any like one-off reason behind this or you are seeing a very sustainable drivers. What kind of on the ground observation do you have so that you can share with us on these wealth opportunities you mentioned? And second on Thailand. So Thailand has experienced -- margin expansion with -- a product mix shift towards higher margin products. But I think this year, we noticed China economy actually, the growth has been a little bit soft. And also, we noticed the political turmoil taking place in the third quarter. So also on the ground, have you observed any change of like product demand because of the economic development? Or is there anything like the political turmoil can deter the business done by agents, especially in the Bangkok area?\nLee Yuan Siong : Okay. Thank you, Michelle. I'll let Hak-Leh talk about Singapore and Thailand in more detail, but I'd just like to say that as a Singaporean, I'm very proud of the performance of AIA Singapore. Now we have a great franchise in Singapore. We have an excellent, very professional agency force. And as I mentioned in my speech, 1 in 4 agents in Singapore are MDRT qualified. It shows the high levels of productivity and professionalism of our agency force in Singapore, and that really underpins the strong performance in Singapore. As for Thailand, I think it is -- after many, many -- I think really the foundation for our performance in Thailand many, many years of hard work to reform the agency force. If you -- you may recall 10 years ago, we started this process to reform and professionalize the agency force in Thailand to introduce the FA program to -- and after many, many years of hard work is beginning to pay dividends. So I'll hand over to Hak-Leh.\nHak Leh Tan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. Thanks, Michelle, for the questions. Let me start with Singapore. Yes, we are very pleased with the excellent performance of Singapore, 27% VONB growth. I stress that the growth was broad-based, across multiple channels and all key product lines. We have a strong agency force, as Yuan Siong mentioned. VONB agency was up 31% from both increase in productivity as well as manpower. Now Agency force in Singapore is very well supported by our superior ecosystem as well as very compelling competitive product propositions. From a product standpoint, the traditional protection business, which has been a key area of focus for us, continued to grow strongly in the first half, up 18%, and the long-term savings business delivered outstanding performance of 35% in the first half driven by the success of our bespoke long-term savings products for the affluent and high net worth individuals in Singapore. And the product was backed by AIA's unique regional fund platform managed by [indiscernible]. So you will see that while the excellent growth of long-term savings in Singapore lowered the overall portfolio margin -- portfolio VONB margin, the growth has actually contributed significantly to the overall VONB growth, which has always been our key focus area. We continue to strengthen our competitive edge in serving the high net worth and affluent segment in Singapore, both [indiscernible] offshore. April this year we introduced first of its kind, AIA international wealth, AIA wealth center in Singapore as well as continue to strengthen our differentiated customer focus driven by our AIA Altitude. So with our market-leading agency force and our expertise in product manufacturing capabilities as well as our superior ecosystem, we are optimistic. We are confident that AIA Singapore is well placed to capitalize on the future growth, especially from the rapidly emerging affluent and high net worth segments. Hope that answers your question. In Thailand, again, as Yuan Siong mentioned, we have a market-leading agency force. Our agency force in Thailand has close to 45% of the market share of the agency segment of the entire industry, also a massive progress built upon multiple years of hard work. We are very to see our FA programs continue to deliver excellent growth in first half this year, grew by 33%. And from the product mix standpoint, we are the market leader in most key products. We're #1 unit linked, #1 in health insurance, #1 in a whole range of protection drivers. We do not see the any major shift in product demand. We believe Protection remains highly relevant to the large majority of the Thai population, the large majority of our customers. And the bulk of our customers are the middle class member. And because of that, the affordability for purchasing value for money, the Protection policies from us that remain high. And of course, we've been in Thailand for 86, 87 years. We have managed our business through multiple cycles of both economic and political turmoils and changes. So I would say in summary, with the strength that we have in Thailand, we remain very confident of the future growth opportunity and our ability to capitalize on them.\nLee Yuan Siong : Thank you, Hak-Leh. One point about Singapore, yes, we saw a strong demand for long-term savings products in Singapore. I'd like to highlight the fact that 2/3 of the long-term savings products is unit-linked and the remaining is participating policies. And on Thailand, I think the near-term economic challenges does not distract from the long-term attractiveness of the Thai market, the drivers for growth for the market that makes Thailand a highly attractive market for AIA remains intact. The growing -- young growing population, the large Protection gap, increasing savings, all that continue to make us pretty excited about the prospects in Thailand, yes.\nLance Burbidge: Did you have a follow-up there, Michelle?\nMichelle Ma: Yes. Very clear. May I follow-up on the split of Singapore business onshore versus offshore?\nHak Leh Tan: Thanks, Michelle. The large majority of our business in Singapore are still onshore business, although we are seeing the increasing contribution from offshore, capitalizing on Singapore status as very important financial hub for the region.\nMichelle Ma: And can we say more than 90%?\nHak Leh Tan: I would say the large majority.\nLance Burbidge: Good try, Michelle.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Chang of CGS-CIMB.\nMichael Chang: Can you hear me?\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes, we can now.\nMichael Chang: It's Michael Chang. First question I had relates to the Hong Kong business. It's a very impressive result for the first half. But maybe could you shed some light on a quarterly basis because the first quarter was up 45% -- first half was up 26%. In terms of forecasting, I just like to understand the quarterly year-on-year growth rates. And related to that, if I take a look at domestic, domestic is extremely strong, up 28% year-on-year faster than the MCV portion of 24%. Can you maybe shed some light on what's driving the domestic Hong Kong business growth in terms of productivity, products and the like? Second question relates to the CSM movement. So I noticed that the CSM movement, you had a negative variance of $172 million in the first half. The reason given was higher U.S. rates. And then if I take a look at the CSM sensitivity to a 50 basis points fall in interest rates, it seems to be positive at 0.8%. So maybe you can just shed some light in terms of, say, if U.S. rates fall going forward, is that possibly or negative? And then maybe lastly, on the Mainland China business. It's a very impressive result. Could you shed some light on the bancassurance outlook, what kind of growth rates was that delivering in the first half. It's now a very material, 16% of VONB. And maybe somewhat related to that, the product mix because I see that the traditional protection mix for VONB in the first half was actually 45%, and that was actually higher than the second half last year of 39%. So it seems that the protection demand is not really falling away in the current environment. It's quite resilient. Could you maybe shed some light on that?\nLee Yuan Siong : Jacky, on Hong Kong?\nJacky Chan: Yes. We want to say that we are pleased with AIA Hong Kong's strong growth across both domestic and MCV customer segment. So it is not just MCV, it's both customer segment. And I want to say that last year, Q1, the border just opened somehow in February. So last year, Q1 was competitively a lower base and therefore our Q1 this year growth is much higher than the Q2 growth on year-on-year basis. But we still have quarter 2, as I said, is a double-digit growth compared to last year Q2. And last year, Q2 was a strong base because a bit of the so-called pent-up demand of MCV after the quarter open. And you also see that we have, this year, Q1 to Q2, we also have a quarter-to-quarter growth. And we remain very positive about the outlook of AIA Hong Kong because we continue to see that this growth are driven by the strong underlying -- the increase in number of active agents, increase in the agency recruitment, which will continue to drive that sustainable business going forward.\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes. And I think also, I'd like to point out the fact that we don't actually manage our business on a quarterly basis. So very pleased that the performance in the first half from Hong Kong and from the rest of the business. On MCV, you can also point to the fact that more and more cities are being allowed to have more freedom to travel to Hong Kong from the Mainland. Now on the CSM, Garth?\nGarth Jones: Yes. Firstly, just to say, Michael, I mean, obviously, $172 million is very small. So it's a small number in a big CSM. There is some of the movement in the path, and resulting from interest rates will get put into the CSM. But clearly, it's amortized by the release of the CSM. So that's what you see here.\nLee Yuan Siong : On China bancassurance, our strategy is very differentiated. We are focused on working with a very selective number of banks, and we are very focused working with them to sell to their affluent customers of these banks as we demonstrated in our presentation. Jacky?\nJacky Chan: Yes. And in Mainland China, our bancassurance is really differentiated. So we are focusing on those really affluent and high net worth customer segment. You can see that the average case size is pretty large. It is USD 19,000 average case size. And the product mix basically mostly long-term saving product and also some of the long-term protection products. And as you also point out, as a whole, our AIA China product mix, we will continue to see a strong growth in the traditional protection products which are mostly driven by our agency force.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Jacky. I think we have 1 question left in the queue.\nOperator: The last question comes from Edwin Liu of CLSA.\nEdwin Liu: I'm Edwin from CLSA. Maybe three questions from me. Firstly, just to follow up on previous analyst question, and let's double click on the Hong Kong domestic market because the growth is quite impressive at 28%. I know from a supply side perspective, we know there's growth in agents and growth in productivity. But just could you share from a demand side perspective, from a customer perspective, any factors to drive such a high growth? So that's my first question on Hong Kong domestic market. Second question, just on share buyback. Previously, I think you mentioned the enhanced capital management framework, but just to ask is the share price -- the current share price factor when you consider your capital management? So I think you mentioned you will consider your business needs, the current capital level, but I guess when will we expect that the current share price would be another important factor when you consider capital return? Last question, given the new accounting, just curious from a management perspective, any suggestion for the investment community how we should value AIA going forward, still on price to EV or maybe we could change to price learning, price book or use CSM matrix, et cetera?\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes. Jacky, I'll hand over to you to talk about Hong Kong domestic customer demand. What I found coming to Hong Kong is the Hong Kong people like to buy insurance.\nJacky Chan: Yes, certainly. And I want to say that the protection gap in the domestic Hong Kong business remain value back, remain unfulfilled. And you also know that Hong Kong is also a fast aging population. Therefore, the demand for long-term saving, retirement and medical health insurance is back. I also want to add one thing because I have been talking about this too many analysts about this. You can see that the Hong Kong population actually is growing. And why? Because we have new Hong Kong people adding to the Hong Kong population. And I let you know, we also track that. In a way, we may call them the new Hong Kong-ers. And now the Hong Kong government is really encouraging more of the migrants coming to Hong Kong. For example, top talent path scheme, quality migrants scheme, and there are also many college graduates coming from overseas. They can make stay in Hong Kong. And this is actually adding to this Hong Kong population. I can tell you, we do track this Hong Kong as a percentage of our new business in domestic. And I'd just let you know they make up something like now is double digit of our domestic new business. So I continue to see a very, very strong demand to grow their domestic customer segment.\nGarth Jones: On share buyback, I think quiet rightly, Edwin, when you looked at our capital management framework, it's about capital management, which we need for the balance sheet and how much net free surplus generation we have. We'll come back to you and talk more about that in March next year when we have the full year results, yes.\nLee Yuan Siong : And the final question?\nGarth Jones: What was the final question, again, I lost it?\nLee Yuan Siong : As you know, as I explained before, our business is about writing profitable new business, growing our VONB, which [indiscernible] growth which translates to a surplus that's distributable to shareholders. And obviously, there's -- as we have demonstrated, there's a link from growing new business to increasing operating earnings. So I think internally, we really look at the EV and VONB metric as the key drivers of the value of the business.\nGarth Jones: Yes. No, I'd agree with that, Yuan Siong. Edwin, we think that the embedded value is a better reflection of the value to shareholders ultimately. It's based on distributable earnings that emerge over time and the value of the business we add each year. I think what the target does is give confidence that, that will flow into earnings growth. And again, the capital management program shows how that VONB will eventually turn into cash and we return to shareholders either through dividends or through share buybacks. So embedded value is the key.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Garth. Does that answer the question, Edwin?\nEdwin Liu: Yes.\nLance Burbidge: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We don't have any more questions from the participants. I will now pass it back to Lance to conclude the session.\nLance Burbidge: Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for watching. And thanks, everyone, for participating, that asked questions. Obviously, Investor Relations are available to answer any follow-up questions. And thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes AIA's 2024 interim results Q&A session. Thank you for your participation.",

      "transcript": "Lance Burbidge: Good morning from AIA Central in Hong Kong, and welcome to our 2024 Interim Results Analyst Briefing. I'm Lance Burbidge, Chief Investor Relations Officer for the AIA Group. With me on stage, I have Lee Yuan Siong, our Group Chief Executive and President; Garth Jones, our group Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 Regional Chief Executives: Jacky, Hak-Leh and Leo. Also in the room, I have other members of our Executive Committee, who can answer questions in case needed. With that, I will move over to our operator and open to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charles Zhou of UBS.\nCharles Zhou: Congratulations. I think it's a very strong set of results, not only about the value of new business, we are also glad to see 10% growth per share CR basis for OPAT and also the USFG. So I have 3 questions. The first question is related to OPAT and USFG, 10% growth CR per share basis in the first half. So what are the reasons and drivers behind? And I think for the first time, AIA also, we're glad to see that you provide us a double-digit guidance for the OPAT, 9% to 11% for the next 3 years. Can you maybe walk us through the drivers behind? And do you have any USFG guidance? That's the first question. Second question is related to China. I think previously, you said you have a target of 1 new branch per year, to open a new branch. Now it's already late August. Do we have any update for this year of new branch opening? And third question, we know in China, we are seeing falling rates. Equity market is also very challenging, macro environment is very challenging in Mainland China. How are you going to deal with this? Can you maybe answer it from both asset and liability? And if possible, can you also maybe give us some sensitivities or quantified impact?\nLee Yuan Siong : Okay. Thank you, Charles, for your question. I'll just kick off by saying, as you know, we are a long-term business. Each year, we write profitable new business and this new business generates future streams of earnings, which is very predictable. And actually add on profitable new business each year. We add on new layers of future earnings, and that actually is the primary driver of earnings growth. I'll hand over to Garth to talk about it in more detail.\nGarth Jones: Yes. Thanks for the question, Charles, and thanks for the congratulations. Again, a very strong performance, as you noted. We're very pleased with the performance, strong new business growth translating into earnings growth and UFSG growth, as you can see. As Yuan Siong just mentioned, the primary driver is the new business growth. You see that coming through the new business CSM that's been added, again, a substantial addition in the first half. and active management of the in-force book to ensure that the assumptions actually occur in practicing. Again, you saw positive variances in the first half that reflect that. I think the target reflects our confidence in the future and our confidence to deliver new business and to manage the in-force portfolio. If you look forward, we set a target of 9% to 11%. I should stress the 11% isn't a cap. And I should also stress that it also includes allowance for the BEPS 2.0, the global minimum tax, at the illustrated level that we've shown today. So with that, I think the UFSG drivers are similar. Obviously, UFSG reflects a shareholders' view and is free surplus generation, it's not earnings, but the drivers are similar new business and management of the in-force. And I think the slides we've shown you will give you some guidance as to how you might project that going forward.\nLee Yuan Siong : On your second question on the China new territories, I'd like to just say that I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making in terms of the performance of the new geographies that we entered. In fact, this year, I have visited Tianjin, I visited Seichuan, I visited Hubei province. And I'm very encouraged by what I saw. I think they are making very good progress in terms of growing the agency force. As for the progress with regards to new licenses, I'll hand over to Jacky.\nJacky Chan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. And Charles, I just want to begin by saying that we are very pleased with AIA China's very strong performance in the first half, 36% VONB growth. And the growth is broad-based across both existing and new geographies, we opened since year 2020, and across both agency and bancassurance channel as well as across both traditional protection and long-term savings products. And the reason why we are able to deliver strong growth in view of this, as you said, economic challenge in China, is because we focus on the middle income and above customer segment, and we have a differentiated premier professional agency force and the underlying driver of our agency. You see 11% growth in the number of active agents. We continue to grow our recruitment by 26%. And even our total agency manpower has grown in the first half. And as to the new geographies, the growth of 44% VONB is supported by 37% growth in number of active agents. We continue to have dialogue with the regulators in both Beijing and also the provincial bureau that we would like to open new license. And we are happy to say that the discussion has been very positive, and we continue to expect 1 or 2 new provincial license in a year.\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes. On your third question about the China interest rates and the macro environment, I'd just like to emphasize the fact that we've been in the region for more than 100 years. We have grown and built our business in the various markets and we have operated through many economic cycles. So managing the asset and liability is something that we do as part of our business. I'll hand over to Garth to talk more about how we are handling the asset and liability situation.\nGarth Jones: Thanks, Yuan Siong, thanks for the question, Charles. I think, obviously, we match our assets and liabilities as close as we can. That's part of our active A&L management. And when we look at the assets, the first thing we look at is the liabilities. We see that our assets are predominantly in government bonds and predominantly in long government bonds. And that means our assets and liabilities are matched as closely as it can be. And you see that in the embedded value sensitivities that we gave out earlier with just a 1% reduction if we move to spot. And if we move the rates down by 50 basis points, then you see a 4% reduction in the embedded value. I think that reflects the A&L management. On an ongoing basis, we obviously reprice and redesign our products. And as interest rates have come down in China, we have positioned the portfolio more towards participating products, in anticipation that if they move lower, we will again move more into participating products than the current product range.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Garth. And Charles, does that answer your questions?\nCharles Zhou: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Thomas Wang of Goldman Sachs.\nThomas Wang: A few questions from me. I think, firstly, on the OPAT per share target. So it's great to see management providing more medium-term target. Just want to clarify, how much sort of buyback and share count reduction have been reflected in that target? If we can sort of simply have maybe an OPAT growth CAGR, what's the underlying assumption of OPAT growth CAGR -- underlying that OPAT per share CAGR target? And secondly, on the CSM movements, what we see, there is a change in the new business CSM to [indiscernible] value multiple. So I think that comes down to roughly 1.5, 1.6 versus previous. I think a couple of years back at 1.9. I just want to get a sense of where this should land if we think about, say, 2 or 3 years down the line?\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes, Garth?\nGarth Jones: Yes. Yes, thanks. As far as the OPAT, we said the target was a per share CAGR. The reason for that, Thomas, is that part of the earnings is the earnings on the surplus capital. We will, obviously, as we go forward, following our new capital management policy, be providing returns to shareholders, both through dividends and through buybacks, and we will look at the position in terms of our shareholder capital ratio and so on, on an ongoing basis. So by using a per share metric, we're saying that, well, if we use the capital to buy back more shares, then clearly, the OPAT itself will reduce by the investment on that capital that per share will increase. So that's the reason for that. On the CSM, the new business CSM, again, as I said earlier, one is an earnings metric, one is a shareholder value metric and reflects not only the surplus that will be generated from the business but also the cost of the capital, full expenses and so on and uses much higher discount rates than the IFRS earnings. So they are quite different. I think the critical thing is that they're both very positive. And you can see that the new business CSM has added considerably to the existing CSM. And as you mentioned, the new business CSM is far above the value of new business at 1.5x. I think it was Lance that said it should remain stable. It does vary like product and geography. But I think the critical thing is that the new business CSM will add to the existing CSM and that's obviously reflected in our target that we gave out today.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Garth. Any question, Thomas?\nThomas Wang: Yes. Just maybe if we can sort of get a sense of what's the driver of the changes year-on-year on that new business sales, just the VONB multiple. As you said, it's product mix. Which geography or which product segment that was driving that change?\nGarth Jones: Yes, there are a sort of variety of factors within that, Thomas. It's perhaps easier to talk to Lance off-line about more of the detail. For example, if you look at the power and non-power products in China, they'll have different ratios and so on. So I think it's one of those things where it's better to look at it holistically and say, well, how does it look holistically and not lose sight of the bigger picture.\nLance Burbidge: Okay. Thanks, Thomas.\nOperator: The next question comes from MW Kim of JPMorgan.\nMW Kim: Congratulations on the very good results. I have two questions. One is about India. So as the company communicated, relatively weaker. The India new business value growth in first half was due to the last year's high base. That said, the business looks very big scare. If the India government would allow the company license in the foreseeable future, how would we think about the product margin outlook in India operation? And also would you share the possible timeline of a separate India business disclosure, please? The next question is about the CSM. If we assume that the bond yield starts to decline from here, would we have potentially the lower new business CSM margin multiple, especially for the whole life? And also under such a big and good new business CSM growth, is it reasonable to assume luckily the mid-single digit, the CSM balance growth outlook in the next few years?\nLee Yuan Siong : Thank you for your question on India. India is obviously one of our growth engines, it's an exciting opportunity, a very large market. We have strong presence. The business is performing very well. Our partnership with TATA, I think the relationship is excellent. We have a very high-quality business where the persistency impact is market-leading, and we are #3 in terms of the private insurance in India. So I'll hand over to Leo to talk about India a bit more.\nLeo Grepin: MW, thanks for your question on India. As Yuan Siong mentioned, the momentum is strong in India. If you look at the period April to June, following our one lag reported first half, which really covers October until March, where last year, we had a strong first quarter because of a change in tax regulation in India. We had comparable very strong last year. But the latest quarter that you've seen reported through industry disclosures was very strong, and TATA AIA was stronger than industry. So we see -- we continue to see very strong momentum, in particular, from our agency and then our strengthening partnership distribution partnerships. For example, we expanded IDFC and then added 2 new banca partnerships, so strong momentum. In terms of how this translates, if there's a change in regulation with the allowance of a composite license. I think there's still a lot of details to be figured out. This potential composite license has been in discussions now for a couple of years and has not come up yet for -- it's not been approved yet. The details of it also are changing quite a bit. So I think it's too early to really prognosticate on the impact that this would have on the industry dynamics or potential profit margins across the industry.\nLee Yuan Siong : Garth, on the CSM question.\nGarth Jones: Yes. On the CSM question, thanks, MW. I think I'd refer you to the financial and operating review, which has the sensitivities in for interest rate movements. For the non-participating business, that's largely locked in at issue. And then for the participating business, that flows through the CSM and is amortized. So you can see the sensitivities are small. As far as new business, clearly, we reprice and while the market consistent basis of the IFRS basis is more market consistent than the value of new business. Over time, that will fluctuate out. So I think the sensitivities are small is the key thing to think about. And new business, we can reprice and redesign and so on. And for India, I think it's a case of when it's big enough, so my challenge to Leo is to make it big enough.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, MW. Does that answer the question?\nMW Kim: Yes.\nLance Burbidge: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kailesh Mistry of HSBC. Kailesh, we cannot hear you.\nKailesh Mistry: There we go. Is that better?\nLance Burbidge: Yes.\nKailesh Mistry: Thank you also for the additional disclosure on free surplus disclosure on Slide 31 and 32. So I just wanted to clarify a couple of points. I guess just on the expected return, the base for that is the $14.5 billion free surplus plus $12 billion of medium term notes. On the diversification benefit, has that always trended around that $400 million number? Or how has it grown historically, just so I can think about how that goes forward. Operating variances, are they consistent with the EV operating variances? And then on Slide 32, the cash generation from the new business, I think, is the $3.4 billion number. Should we assume that breaks down into the 5-year bucket the same as the in-force for our projections? Secondly, moving on to OPAT. Obviously, the target is welcome. Just wanted to understand is the interest rate assumption as interest rates currently are? Or are you assuming something different in setting that target? So yes, those two, please?\nLee Yuan Siong : Garth, I guess, a question for you.\nGarth Jones: If I can remember all. Yes, the expected return on free surplus and assets backing MTNs is indeed as it says on the term. Now the diversification benefit from new business, that's something that occurs every year as we write new business, and it's broadly been similar to the value of new business. It clearly varies by product and by market, but it's been broadly similar to value of new business growth. For the rest of it, you asked about variances. Variances were similar, yes, I think, 0.3. They're still with -- it's EV, consistent with the EV and UFSG, they are effectively both on the same basis. And in terms of the buckets, I think you'll see each year how that adds going forward. And I think the critical thing here is that we've illustrated the DE from the in-force is relatively stable. And I think that's important.\nLee Yuan Siong : And the interest rate assumption on the OPAT target.\nGarth Jones: Yes. Obviously, it's framed in the current environment, but we have run a range of scenarios going forward, and we remain confident that the target that we've set can be met.\nLance Burbidge: Does that answer everything, Kailesh? Or did we miss something?\nKailesh Mistry: I think you answered it. I had one more that I forgot to ask, which is on the Hong Kong business. I guess two things. Firstly, I think it's the only one, if I haven't missed it, where you haven't talked about active agent growth or not. So if you could update us on that, that would be great. Secondly, on the offshore business, was the second quarter greater than the first quarter, which was greater than the quarters in the second half of last year, I think. And could you just update us on case sizes and protection versus savings mix, I think?\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes. I'll hand over to Jacky to talk about Hong Kong, but I just want to start by saying that I'm very pleased with the performance in Hong Kong because we saw very strong growth both from domestic and MCV segments.\nJacky Chan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. In fact, the Hong Kong growth is also driven by a very strong fundamentals of the Premier Agency in Hong Kong. Number of active agent growth and our new record also grew by 19%, so adding more active manpower to both domestic and the MCV customer segment. And as to the MCV, as you talked about on the second quarter, AIA Hong Kong have quarter-to-quarter growth, Q2 over last year Q2, double digit growth in VONB. And we continue to see a strong demand from the MCV customers. And in fact, our MCV customer number, new business in the first half continued to have a double-digit growth compared to last year first half. So we continue to see that strong demand of MCV offshore coming to Hong Kong remain unchanged.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Jacky. Thanks, Kailesh, for the questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Xu of Morgan Stanley.\nRichard Xu: Two questions from me. One is on China. Could you talk a little bit about the agent recruiting trends? Is the current environment actually better for agent recruitment given some of the challenges in China labor market at the moment? And what are the future plans? And then also on China, the product mix, could you talk a little bit on that as well? I mean it seems like both agents and products are the key contribution for the very impressive growth in China. So a little bit more color on that will be very helpful. And then secondly, on the other markets, you talk a little bit about India. [indiscernible] clearly as a whole, it was lagging other markets. Any outlook on that? And for example, Vietnam or other markets, will we see, in addition to India, what will they be rebounds in other markets?\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes. I'll hand over to Jacky to talk about the China recruitment and product mix. Like I say, after I visited China frequently and have many interactions with the local management plus the agency force. Very happy with the quality of the agency force. I think in terms of the quality of the recruitment, we are really very selective even in the new geographies, it was commented to me by external parties that we recruit agents as rigorous -- that the recruitment process for the new agent is as rigorous as the recruitment for full time employee in AIA.\nJacky Chan: Yes. Thank you, Yuan Siong. I just want to reiterate this because the differentiation of AIA China is really our premier full-time professional agency force. So as you say, oh, now it's a big economic challenge in Mainland China, but we continue to be highly selective or the new agent has to go through at least 3 rounds of interviews. And right now, our new recruit has growth of 26%, and in fact, more than 94% of those are new recruits. They have a college degree or above. So we really continue to focusing on increasing our quality and premium agent. And that's why you can see that we continue to drive a very strong growth of active agent from both the new recruit and also the existing agent. And as to the product, that is also closely related to our Premier Agency because we are targeting the middle income above customer segment, which more resilient under this so-called economic challenge environment. And in terms of the product mix, you can also see that in first half this year, we also diversify more towards participating product. And our Premier Agency is more than capable of able to explain this more complicated participating product to the customers. So in the first half, you can see that our product mix, as I said, we have double-digit growth on our traditional protection products as well as very strong growth from the long-term saving product. And as for the long-term saving product, we have diversified with participating long-term saving products. And our Premier Agency force also continued to sell quite a bit of those tax deductible personal pension benefit in the first half. That kind of retirement and personal pension benefit saving plan made up of roughly 25% of our new business in the first half. And I just want to let you know, in fact, in July this year, we continue to launch new products, which are tax deductible, which is a very welcome tax-deductible long-term care product, which in effect is a more [indiscernible] product. So this really reflects how our Premier Agency force targeting the affluent customer segment work very well in the current situation.\nLee Yuan Siong : On other markets, I think Leo explained just now about the temporary fluctuation to the strong growth in India as a result of the very high base in January to March last year due to the tax changes. But if you take out India, other markets actually grew by 21%. We all know in the past, we've talked about the challenges that in the Vietnam market, but we've seen good recovery momentum in our Vietnam market. At the same time, we are very pleased with the fact that we were able to extend our bancassurance partnership with BCA in Indonesia to 2038. So very encouraged by the performance of other markets. And as I said, India is a temporary fluctuation in the growth. That's very specific to India, yes.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Yuan Siong. Did That get all the questions you had there, Richard?\nRichard Xu: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michelle Ma of Citi.\nMichelle Ma: Big congrats on the results with literally no weakness on this set of results. I have two questions here. It's about Singapore and Thailand. For Singapore, actually, that's a true surprise for me, very strong growth of 27%. And as mentioned, the growth can be attributable to the growing wealth opportunities. So could you shed more light on this? So I wonder whether this very strong growth, whether there is any like one-off reason behind this or you are seeing a very sustainable drivers. What kind of on the ground observation do you have so that you can share with us on these wealth opportunities you mentioned? And second on Thailand. So Thailand has experienced -- margin expansion with -- a product mix shift towards higher margin products. But I think this year, we noticed China economy actually, the growth has been a little bit soft. And also, we noticed the political turmoil taking place in the third quarter. So also on the ground, have you observed any change of like product demand because of the economic development? Or is there anything like the political turmoil can deter the business done by agents, especially in the Bangkok area?\nLee Yuan Siong : Okay. Thank you, Michelle. I'll let Hak-Leh talk about Singapore and Thailand in more detail, but I'd just like to say that as a Singaporean, I'm very proud of the performance of AIA Singapore. Now we have a great franchise in Singapore. We have an excellent, very professional agency force. And as I mentioned in my speech, 1 in 4 agents in Singapore are MDRT qualified. It shows the high levels of productivity and professionalism of our agency force in Singapore, and that really underpins the strong performance in Singapore. As for Thailand, I think it is -- after many, many -- I think really the foundation for our performance in Thailand many, many years of hard work to reform the agency force. If you -- you may recall 10 years ago, we started this process to reform and professionalize the agency force in Thailand to introduce the FA program to -- and after many, many years of hard work is beginning to pay dividends. So I'll hand over to Hak-Leh.\nHak Leh Tan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. Thanks, Michelle, for the questions. Let me start with Singapore. Yes, we are very pleased with the excellent performance of Singapore, 27% VONB growth. I stress that the growth was broad-based, across multiple channels and all key product lines. We have a strong agency force, as Yuan Siong mentioned. VONB agency was up 31% from both increase in productivity as well as manpower. Now Agency force in Singapore is very well supported by our superior ecosystem as well as very compelling competitive product propositions. From a product standpoint, the traditional protection business, which has been a key area of focus for us, continued to grow strongly in the first half, up 18%, and the long-term savings business delivered outstanding performance of 35% in the first half driven by the success of our bespoke long-term savings products for the affluent and high net worth individuals in Singapore. And the product was backed by AIA's unique regional fund platform managed by [indiscernible]. So you will see that while the excellent growth of long-term savings in Singapore lowered the overall portfolio margin -- portfolio VONB margin, the growth has actually contributed significantly to the overall VONB growth, which has always been our key focus area. We continue to strengthen our competitive edge in serving the high net worth and affluent segment in Singapore, both [indiscernible] offshore. April this year we introduced first of its kind, AIA international wealth, AIA wealth center in Singapore as well as continue to strengthen our differentiated customer focus driven by our AIA Altitude. So with our market-leading agency force and our expertise in product manufacturing capabilities as well as our superior ecosystem, we are optimistic. We are confident that AIA Singapore is well placed to capitalize on the future growth, especially from the rapidly emerging affluent and high net worth segments. Hope that answers your question. In Thailand, again, as Yuan Siong mentioned, we have a market-leading agency force. Our agency force in Thailand has close to 45% of the market share of the agency segment of the entire industry, also a massive progress built upon multiple years of hard work. We are very to see our FA programs continue to deliver excellent growth in first half this year, grew by 33%. And from the product mix standpoint, we are the market leader in most key products. We're #1 unit linked, #1 in health insurance, #1 in a whole range of protection drivers. We do not see the any major shift in product demand. We believe Protection remains highly relevant to the large majority of the Thai population, the large majority of our customers. And the bulk of our customers are the middle class member. And because of that, the affordability for purchasing value for money, the Protection policies from us that remain high. And of course, we've been in Thailand for 86, 87 years. We have managed our business through multiple cycles of both economic and political turmoils and changes. So I would say in summary, with the strength that we have in Thailand, we remain very confident of the future growth opportunity and our ability to capitalize on them.\nLee Yuan Siong : Thank you, Hak-Leh. One point about Singapore, yes, we saw a strong demand for long-term savings products in Singapore. I'd like to highlight the fact that 2/3 of the long-term savings products is unit-linked and the remaining is participating policies. And on Thailand, I think the near-term economic challenges does not distract from the long-term attractiveness of the Thai market, the drivers for growth for the market that makes Thailand a highly attractive market for AIA remains intact. The growing -- young growing population, the large Protection gap, increasing savings, all that continue to make us pretty excited about the prospects in Thailand, yes.\nLance Burbidge: Did you have a follow-up there, Michelle?\nMichelle Ma: Yes. Very clear. May I follow-up on the split of Singapore business onshore versus offshore?\nHak Leh Tan: Thanks, Michelle. The large majority of our business in Singapore are still onshore business, although we are seeing the increasing contribution from offshore, capitalizing on Singapore status as very important financial hub for the region.\nMichelle Ma: And can we say more than 90%?\nHak Leh Tan: I would say the large majority.\nLance Burbidge: Good try, Michelle.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Chang of CGS-CIMB.\nMichael Chang: Can you hear me?\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes, we can now.\nMichael Chang: It's Michael Chang. First question I had relates to the Hong Kong business. It's a very impressive result for the first half. But maybe could you shed some light on a quarterly basis because the first quarter was up 45% -- first half was up 26%. In terms of forecasting, I just like to understand the quarterly year-on-year growth rates. And related to that, if I take a look at domestic, domestic is extremely strong, up 28% year-on-year faster than the MCV portion of 24%. Can you maybe shed some light on what's driving the domestic Hong Kong business growth in terms of productivity, products and the like? Second question relates to the CSM movement. So I noticed that the CSM movement, you had a negative variance of $172 million in the first half. The reason given was higher U.S. rates. And then if I take a look at the CSM sensitivity to a 50 basis points fall in interest rates, it seems to be positive at 0.8%. So maybe you can just shed some light in terms of, say, if U.S. rates fall going forward, is that possibly or negative? And then maybe lastly, on the Mainland China business. It's a very impressive result. Could you shed some light on the bancassurance outlook, what kind of growth rates was that delivering in the first half. It's now a very material, 16% of VONB. And maybe somewhat related to that, the product mix because I see that the traditional protection mix for VONB in the first half was actually 45%, and that was actually higher than the second half last year of 39%. So it seems that the protection demand is not really falling away in the current environment. It's quite resilient. Could you maybe shed some light on that?\nLee Yuan Siong : Jacky, on Hong Kong?\nJacky Chan: Yes. We want to say that we are pleased with AIA Hong Kong's strong growth across both domestic and MCV customer segment. So it is not just MCV, it's both customer segment. And I want to say that last year, Q1, the border just opened somehow in February. So last year, Q1 was competitively a lower base and therefore our Q1 this year growth is much higher than the Q2 growth on year-on-year basis. But we still have quarter 2, as I said, is a double-digit growth compared to last year Q2. And last year, Q2 was a strong base because a bit of the so-called pent-up demand of MCV after the quarter open. And you also see that we have, this year, Q1 to Q2, we also have a quarter-to-quarter growth. And we remain very positive about the outlook of AIA Hong Kong because we continue to see that this growth are driven by the strong underlying -- the increase in number of active agents, increase in the agency recruitment, which will continue to drive that sustainable business going forward.\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes. And I think also, I'd like to point out the fact that we don't actually manage our business on a quarterly basis. So very pleased that the performance in the first half from Hong Kong and from the rest of the business. On MCV, you can also point to the fact that more and more cities are being allowed to have more freedom to travel to Hong Kong from the Mainland. Now on the CSM, Garth?\nGarth Jones: Yes. Firstly, just to say, Michael, I mean, obviously, $172 million is very small. So it's a small number in a big CSM. There is some of the movement in the path, and resulting from interest rates will get put into the CSM. But clearly, it's amortized by the release of the CSM. So that's what you see here.\nLee Yuan Siong : On China bancassurance, our strategy is very differentiated. We are focused on working with a very selective number of banks, and we are very focused working with them to sell to their affluent customers of these banks as we demonstrated in our presentation. Jacky?\nJacky Chan: Yes. And in Mainland China, our bancassurance is really differentiated. So we are focusing on those really affluent and high net worth customer segment. You can see that the average case size is pretty large. It is USD 19,000 average case size. And the product mix basically mostly long-term saving product and also some of the long-term protection products. And as you also point out, as a whole, our AIA China product mix, we will continue to see a strong growth in the traditional protection products which are mostly driven by our agency force.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Jacky. I think we have 1 question left in the queue.\nOperator: The last question comes from Edwin Liu of CLSA.\nEdwin Liu: I'm Edwin from CLSA. Maybe three questions from me. Firstly, just to follow up on previous analyst question, and let's double click on the Hong Kong domestic market because the growth is quite impressive at 28%. I know from a supply side perspective, we know there's growth in agents and growth in productivity. But just could you share from a demand side perspective, from a customer perspective, any factors to drive such a high growth? So that's my first question on Hong Kong domestic market. Second question, just on share buyback. Previously, I think you mentioned the enhanced capital management framework, but just to ask is the share price -- the current share price factor when you consider your capital management? So I think you mentioned you will consider your business needs, the current capital level, but I guess when will we expect that the current share price would be another important factor when you consider capital return? Last question, given the new accounting, just curious from a management perspective, any suggestion for the investment community how we should value AIA going forward, still on price to EV or maybe we could change to price learning, price book or use CSM matrix, et cetera?\nLee Yuan Siong : Yes. Jacky, I'll hand over to you to talk about Hong Kong domestic customer demand. What I found coming to Hong Kong is the Hong Kong people like to buy insurance.\nJacky Chan: Yes, certainly. And I want to say that the protection gap in the domestic Hong Kong business remain value back, remain unfulfilled. And you also know that Hong Kong is also a fast aging population. Therefore, the demand for long-term saving, retirement and medical health insurance is back. I also want to add one thing because I have been talking about this too many analysts about this. You can see that the Hong Kong population actually is growing. And why? Because we have new Hong Kong people adding to the Hong Kong population. And I let you know, we also track that. In a way, we may call them the new Hong Kong-ers. And now the Hong Kong government is really encouraging more of the migrants coming to Hong Kong. For example, top talent path scheme, quality migrants scheme, and there are also many college graduates coming from overseas. They can make stay in Hong Kong. And this is actually adding to this Hong Kong population. I can tell you, we do track this Hong Kong as a percentage of our new business in domestic. And I'd just let you know they make up something like now is double digit of our domestic new business. So I continue to see a very, very strong demand to grow their domestic customer segment.\nGarth Jones: On share buyback, I think quiet rightly, Edwin, when you looked at our capital management framework, it's about capital management, which we need for the balance sheet and how much net free surplus generation we have. We'll come back to you and talk more about that in March next year when we have the full year results, yes.\nLee Yuan Siong : And the final question?\nGarth Jones: What was the final question, again, I lost it?\nLee Yuan Siong : As you know, as I explained before, our business is about writing profitable new business, growing our VONB, which [indiscernible] growth which translates to a surplus that's distributable to shareholders. And obviously, there's -- as we have demonstrated, there's a link from growing new business to increasing operating earnings. So I think internally, we really look at the EV and VONB metric as the key drivers of the value of the business.\nGarth Jones: Yes. No, I'd agree with that, Yuan Siong. Edwin, we think that the embedded value is a better reflection of the value to shareholders ultimately. It's based on distributable earnings that emerge over time and the value of the business we add each year. I think what the target does is give confidence that, that will flow into earnings growth. And again, the capital management program shows how that VONB will eventually turn into cash and we return to shareholders either through dividends or through share buybacks. So embedded value is the key.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Garth. Does that answer the question, Edwin?\nEdwin Liu: Yes.\nLance Burbidge: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We don't have any more questions from the participants. I will now pass it back to Lance to conclude the session.\nLance Burbidge: Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for watching. And thanks, everyone, for participating, that asked questions. Obviously, Investor Relations are available to answer any follow-up questions. And thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes AIA's 2024 interim results Q&A session. Thank you for your participation.",

    "fullTranscript": "Lance Burbidge: Good morning from AIA Central in Hong Kong. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 update Q&A session. I'm Lance Burbidge, Chief Investor Relations Officer for AIA Group. Together with me today are Lee Yuan Siong, our Group CEO and President; and Garth Jones, our group CFO. We also have other members of the group executive committee either with us in the room or joining us remotely. Before we start the Q&A, Yuan Siong and Garth will take you through a short presentation on our first quarter new business performance and our new capital management policy. Yuan Siong.\nLee Yuan Siong: Good morning, everyone. Today, I'm very pleased to announce our policy, clearly demonstrating the strength of AIA's business model and our financial discipline. Value of new business for the group grew by 31% in the first quarter of 2024. We delivered AIA's highest ever quarterly new business result, building on our very strong VONB performance in 2023. Our new capital management policy provides greater clarity as to how we will deliver higher annual capital returns to shareholders. Following this new policy, the Board has approved a further $2 billion buyback, which increases our existing share buyback program to a total of $12 billion. I'm confident that AIA is exceptionally well positioned to capture the highly attractive opportunities available to us across the region. We continue to focus on driving high-quality profitable new business group that delivers increased future earnings, free surplus generation and greater shareholder value. Let me now take you through the first quarter new business highlights. VONB was $1.3 billion, a record high for a quarter and up by 31%. We delivered double-digit growth from all our reportable segments with VONB margin increasing by 2.1 percentage points to 54.2%. AIA China was up 38%, driven by very strong double-digit growth from our Premier Agency, supplemented by growth from our highly selective bancassurance partners, where VONB margin increased to around 40%. Growth was broad-based across our established operations and new branches and the VONB margin for AIA China increased further from the second half of 2023 to 54.6%. AIA Hong Kong grew by 43% with double-digit growth from both the domestic and Mainland Chinese visitor customer segments. New business from Mainland Chinese visitors continue to build momentum with VONB in the first quarter higher than in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our three largest ASEAN markets, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia, all grew by double digits, with combined VONB growth of 16%, and our Other Markets segment was up by 10% with excellent growth from Tata AIA Life in India and strong performances from Australia, the Philippines and South Korea. Today's announcement clearly demonstrates the strength and diversification of AIA's businesses, which enables us to capture the significant growth opportunities across Asia and deliver capital returns to shareholders. I will now hand over to Garth.\nGarth Jones: Thank you, Yuan Siong. There are two key components to our enhanced capital management policy announced today. The first component is an annual payout target rate ratio target that supplements our progressive dividend policy with annual share buybacks. The second component is a commitment to regularly review our capital position and return capital that is access to our needs at least annually. As a result of this, we are adding $2 billion to our existing share buyback program. We expect this to commence as soon as practicable and to complete in our own 12 months. Let me now explain how this policy works in practice and how we assess our capital position from a shareholder's perspective. While the group LCSM surplus is our principal regulatory solvency measure, we've always said that free surplus provides a more representative view of the capital position for shareholders. Since the introduction of the LCSM framework, we've shown a reconciliation of the group LCSM surplus and free surplus consistently in our interim and annual results. Free surplus removes items included in the LCSM that are not available for distribution to shareholders, for example, the surplus within par funds. We calculate the group's total capital resources by adding free surplus to eligible Tier 2 debt and required capital. On this basis, the ratio of total capital resources to required capital was 269% at the end of 2023. The first priority within our capital management framework is to maintain a strong and resilient balance sheet. While required capital includes the prescribed capital levels for our various businesses set by our regulators, we hold additional capital that allows us to withstand a range of extreme but plausible stress scenarios, whilst also ensuring we do not constrain organic new business growth. For example, we include a repeat of the, GFC, pandemics, persistent high and low interest rate scenarios. We also allow for combinations of these scenarios at the same time. Based on our assessment of our current capital needs, including these scenarios, we target for shareholder total capital resources to comfortably exceed 200% of required capital. On completion of the remaining $2.8 billion from the existing share buyback program, together with the additional $2 billion buyback announced today are free surplus on a pro forma basis as at the end of 2023, reduces to $11.5 billion. The pro forma ratio of shareholder total capital resources to required capital reduces to 238%. Our new enhanced capital management policy provides greater clarity and will deliver higher annual capital returns to shareholders. Starting from our 2024 annual results, we will target a payout ratio of 75% of annual net free surplus generation through dividends and share buybacks. Net free surplus generation is calculated as shown using figures that we have consistently included in our results announcement. Net free surplus generation is calculated before investment return variances. While investment return variances, foreign exchange and other nonoperating items create free surplus volatility from year-to-year, they have averaged under $80 million a year since our IPO. This formulaic approach automatically adjusts for further organic investment in profitable new business. As we grow the business, the balance sheet and required capital will increase, driving the need to retain some net free surplus generated. However, with a 75% payout ratio, we expect the total capital resources to required capital ratio to fall over time from 238% as we grow and regularly return capital to shareholders. For clarity and completeness, our policy of delivering prudent, sustainable and progressive dividends remains unchanged. The balance of the payout above dividends with a target 75% aggregate payout ratio will be provided by way of share buybacks announced at the annual results each year. Let me now illustrate how our capital management policy will work in practice based on our 2023 annual results. As I said, there are two components to the policy, and it is important to consider these together. Net free surplus generation was $3.9 billion after new business investment of $1.3 billion. Under the first component of the policy based on the 75% payout ratio target, $2.9 billion would have been returned to shareholders. The 2023 interim and final dividends totaled $2.3 billion. The $0.6 billion balance would therefore come in the form of an additional share buyback. We will announce this year's net FSG, final dividend and additional share buyback at our 2024 annual results. Under the second component of the policy, the regular review of our capital position, we have today added $2 billion to our existing share buyback program. This is in addition to the $2.8 billion we will return in 2024 and the annual dividend payment. Together, these amount to roughly 10% of our recent market capitalization. In conclusion, you can see that overall, our new capital management policy provides both greater clarity and higher capital returns to shareholders. I'll now hand back to you, Yuan Siong.\nLee Yuan Siong: Thank you, Garth. In closing, today's very strong new business growth, combined with the clarity from our new capital management policy clearly demonstrate the strength of AIA's significant competitive advantages, operational delivery and financial discipline. We have the right strategic priorities and our consistent execution gives me great confidence that we can continue to deliver significant value creation for our shareholders. Over to you, Lance.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Yuan Siong. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. So over to you, operator. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Charles Zhou of UBS Security. Charles, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nCheng Zhou: So, congratulations. I think it's a very strong set of results. And also finally, we got more clarity about -- congratulations. I think it's a very strong set of results. And also finally, we're glad to see some clarity about the enhanced capital management plan. So, I've got two questions for management. First, some of your peers have provided a long-term target for the underlying for surplus or maybe some free surplus. So, can you maybe -- does AIA have any targets or can you talk about any targets for the long term, otherwise, any colors or key consideration in thinking about the net free surplus generation will be very helpful because I guess, we need to do some projection here? And second, after the recent regulatory inspection on the MCV focused brokers in Hong Kong, I would like to hear from management, what do you think about the outlook for this channel in second quarter and also beyond? And also, AIA Hong Kong growth prospects as a whole, do you think this is an individual event? Or does it indicate a wider clamp down such as capital control on the MCV business?\nGarth Jones: Yes. Firstly -- thanks, Charles. I understand the need to try to project this in some way forward. I think the important thing to remember is that as with our metrics on earnings, similarly, there are successive layers that we put on a profitable new business translate into underlying free surplus generation. So, as we explained, I think, at the full year, as you add further new business layers, those add to earnings. They improved the ROE and then also the add-on to the free surplus generation going forward. This layering comes through. I suggest in terms of forecasting, it's probably better to talk to our IR team and get technical support. There are a few elements to put in there. Why we thought of net free surplus generation was that then clearly, the best way we can create value for shareholders is by growing the business organically and then the higher the new business strain, and that will obviously impact net free surplus generation, but that will indicate that we are growing the business very strongly and creating greater value for shareholders.\nLee Yuan Siong: I would just add that the underlying free plus generation is a very key metric that the management is very focused on. It is one of the key metrics in our short-term incentive program, and we intend to introduce this as another metric in our long-term incentive program as well. So, it is a very important metric that the management is very focused on.\nJacky Chan: Thank you for the question on the MCV broker. First of all, the investigation by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority and ICAC, it is still under investigation, and the identity of the broker has not been disclosed. First of all, I want to let you know that, in fact, since the border will be opened in last year, the Hong Kong life insurance industry has been in discussion with the Hong Kong Insurance Authority to keep review and investigate the sales package of certain sales intermediates to ensure full compliance of the MCV business and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the MCV business. And in the case of AIA, you all -- you know that AIA holds a very high standard on compliance, on MCV policies. We require the MCV customer to be passed in Hong Kong or Macau and our staff at the WalletSafe Center will meet with the customer, we will ensure all the proper documentation, et cetera. And also, we carry out welcome call to check the MCV customer on the sales process, et cetera. So, in fact, AIA very welcome, the initiative taken by Hong Kong Insurance Authority in this case. And as I said, this is still under investigation, but in view of the heightened risk of this concerned broker, AIA Hong Kong already suspended new business coming from this broker. First of all, I really want to reiterate that the MCV business is a business in the Hong Kong insurance industry for almost more than two decades, and the MCV customer flow coming to Hong Kong remain very strong. And in the case of AIA, we have a diversified distribution channels and our core agency channel actually took up more than 60% of the MCV business of AIA Hong Kong and the rest is coming from our diversified bank assurance partnership and more than 100 brokers. So, we see that the so-called short-term impact from this broker to Hong Kong -- to AIA actually is very, very minimal. And in fact, this will really help the long-term sustainability of the MCV business through the broker channel.\nLee Yuan Siong: Yes, I agree with Jacky, and I really welcome the actions taken by the Hong Kong AIA because I believe it will support the long-term sustainability of MCV business in the Hong Kong market.\nLance Burbidge: Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Thomas Wang of Goldman Sachs. Thomas, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nThomas Wang: A couple of questions. Firstly, I just wanted a little bit more detail on our total capital target of comfortably above 200%. Can you share a little bit more color on that? And how you think about free service and eligible debt mix within the resources? How about comfortable you -- how much sort of are you comfortable raising that use of eligible debt to capital resources? Sorry, the other thing is Mainland China. Can you talk about the bancassurance and agency mix in terms of sales of VONB in the first quarter? And then have you kind of completed with the rollout of bancassurance as this is the sort of the major rollout of bancassurance channel? And how do you see that mix evolve for the rest of the year and into next year?\nGarth Jones: As we showed earlier, we're targeting this shareholder capital ratio that comfortably exceeds 200%, and when we look at reviewing our capital position regularly and looking at the capital that is in excess of our needs, that also includes optimizing our overall capital structure, depending on debt market capacity and conditions. Clearly, the group retains additional financial flexibility from its debt capacity. And from a ratio perspective, our current credit ratings, our Moody's leverage ratio could go up from the current around 15% to around 20%. But we're comfortable with our current financial ratings. Clearly, our business is a life insurance business. It's retail. It's not as sensitive to credit ratings as say, commercial non-life insurance. But we do look at both the amount of capital we need and the structure of that capital on an ongoing basis in order to optimize both.\nJacky Chan: Thomas, let me take you through our very strong AIA China result in the first quarter. We are very pleased that the growth is broad-based across both agency and also bancassurance channel. Furthermore, our protection VONB also grew double digit in the first quarter this year. Our agency remains our core channel and the agency growth is driven by growth in a number of active agents and more than 20% growth in a number of new vehicles and a number of new active agents. And this is a broad-based and the ANP per active agent also grew strongly in first quarter. So, our agency really continued to perform very well in both protection and long-term savings products. As our differentiated bancassurance, we continue to focus on our partner, our strategic partners, banks, including China Postal Group, Bank of East Asia, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and Bank of China. We've continued to focus on the affluent and above customer segment and the average case size speed for itself. It is a very, very strong average case size. Our bancassurance profitability actually also improved in the first quarter from last year, first quarter to this year, first quarter that was almost a VONB margin of 40%. So, we are very pleased with this differentiated bancassurance channel. And in the first quarter, the bancassurance channel contributed roughly 15% of our total VONB of China. We continue to be very bullish about the outlook of our AIA China business in Mainland China.\nLance Burbidge: Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from MW Kim of JPMorgan. MW, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nMW Kim: And really appreciate your quarterly management call. Following this announcement, as previously mentioned, the underlying free surplus generation perhaps become more important, the figure to the shareholders and broad stakeholder. So, my first question is about the management KPI. Currently, the new business value has a larger weight in the management KPI. Would you expect potentially higher weight on underlying free surplus generation in short-term incentive scheme moving forward? And next question is about India. As the Company commented in the report, India joint venture seem to enjoy excellent journey with bigger scale. Would you expect a more detailed number in the India business in the foreseeable future?\nLee Yuan Siong: Now in terms of the nature of our business is a long-term business. And as you know, writing profitable new business is key to supporting our future earnings and future free surplus generation. So, we will continue to be very focused on our VONB, and it will be -- it will continue to be the most important metric in our incentive programs, right? I've mentioned just now that we are very focused on operating profit. We are focused on EV. We are very focused on underlying free surplus generation. And as a result, we are introducing the underlying free surplus generation as a new metric to the LTI program. And this is -- this will allow us to have additional focus on the UFSG number going forward.\nGarth Jones: We -- just to add, we've always said that VONB is a leading indicator. And as I just mentioned, that leading indicator of VONB then translates into a stream of earnings, a stream of free surplus going forward. And so that leading indicator will be -- continue to be important. What you'll then see is that the earnings and the free service will come through, and it's important then we look at those, and that reflects then the ongoing operating performance and management of the in-force, clearly, we'll look at managing the capital. So, we're managing the E as well as the R in order to further improve our ROE over time. On India, as you say, excellent growth in India. We're very excited about that business. It continues to perform very, very well. And I think, you'll see increasingly more information coming from that. Clearly, there's a lot of information in the local market that's available in addition to what we provide. And we'll look to keep people well informed of our developments there because we think it's a key growth engine for the future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kailesh Mistry of HSBC. Kailesh, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nKailesh Mistry: Thank you for the incremental disclosure today on capital management and new business. However, I've got three questions. The first set of questions are on capital management and the modeling of that. I guess one of the key assumptions is required capital. That grew by about 10% per annum over the last five years. Is this a reasonable assumption going forward? Or should it be higher given the new business growth? On eligible debt, just to follow-up on the previous answer. I think, Garth mentioned you had additional capacity of 5 percentage points on the Moody's calculation. Just to clarify, is that all eligible for an LCSM basis, which I think is the number that's included in this calculation? Secondly, just on China. What was the product mix in the first quarter versus 2023? I guess, split between pensions protection and the other savings business? And on Hong Kong offshore, again, what was the product mix? Did we see a bounce back in protection and the savings case sizes held up?\nGarth Jones: In terms of the required capital, you'd expect that to grow in line with the business. I think the important thing to look at is the free surplus overall rather than just being fixated on a ratio. Clearly, the free surplus will continue to grow. I think the key thing will be to sort of have a broad model of the business and maybe again, the best thing to do will be to talk to the IR team to work through how that might be best done. But as we said, we expect that ratio of free surplus to require capital to continue to fall over time based on the 75% payout ratio of net free surplus generation, and we'll continue to review that on an annual basis at least and see where we are. In terms of the eligible debt, clearly, the room we have in terms of the ratings does vary by a rating agency. We've quoted the Moody's number here. It does provide us with important financial flexibility for whatever purpose. And clearly, you also have to consider the capacity of debt markets and structuring and so on at the same time as well. So, a number of things to think about. In terms of the LCSM. The LCSM clearly includes regulatory eligible debt. There are different conditions for that and for ratings agency eligible debt, they are broadly similar. And each rating agency, as you know, has different criteria. So, we look to have debt that covers all of those different requirements and be eligible for both ratings and for solvency, but there are differences between each basis.\nJacky Chan: On product mix, China. So, there are really some differences because AIA China always innovate our product and keep in place in the competitive market. So last year, first quarter, we didn't have the tax deferred personal pension benefit. Last year, first quarter, we only saw very, very small personnel participating business. And also last year, first quarter, we have -- we roll out the first in the market, the so-called simplified use of CI. So, it is quite different in the agency channel. So, this year, first quarter in the agency channel, the tax deferred personal pension time actually is one of our top selling products in the agency channel, and they also help our new agent and also our agents in general to acquire new customers. And then secondly, we continue to focus on CI, our flagship, as you wish [indiscernible] product has growth in the first quarter this year compared to last year first quarter. And overall, our total potential UMB has strong double-digit growth as we also focused on a lot of those renewable medical and in some business in the agency channel. And lastly, in the agency channel. In this year, we roll out participating products. And in first quarter, it made up about 10% of our agency VONB. So, this gives you a feel of that difference. But as a whole, the agency channel VONB margin, even though the interest rate comes down. We already adopt the China association, interest rate in the VONB and our agency VONB margins still hold up at about 60% at a similar level compared to our first quarter last year. As to our bancassurance channel, our differentiated bancassurance channel, as I said, the margin increased to 40%. And the bancassurance channel continue to sell a lot of a mix of long-term saving product and long-term protection products. So that is about the product mix of a China in the first quarter. As to Hong Kong, the MCV product mix roughly remain -- roughly remain unchanged. The protection sales remain to contribute more than 50% by new business policies. And the average case size of the MCV business roughly hold up at about US$19,000, similar level as last year, whole year. And our long-term saving product continue to be very welcome by the MCV customer. So basically, I would say, in the case of AIA Hong Kong Macau, the MCV product mix roughly is similar to the last year level.\nLance Burbidge: Any follow-up questions, Kailesh?\nKailesh Mistry: No follow-up questions, but just a sort of request, I guess, some of your peers do allow us to model that required capital a little bit more clearly. So that additional level of disclosure might be helpful. And similarly, on the undiscounted VIF profit emergence, which I think you currently put in five-year buckets. But yes, those would be two requests for disclosure, I guess.\nLance Burbidge: Understood. Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Xu of Morgan Stanley. Richard, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nRichard Xu: Again, very congrats on a very solid first quarter. Two questions from me. One is, obviously, some of these strong numbers was still probably helped by low base. For Hong Kong going forward, for example, for second quarter was high base last year and then going for the full year based on the current trends, what are some of the guidance expectations for growth for first half and then maybe any guidance for -- a little bit further for that? And second question is on China. Obviously, China is going through some transition. Certainly, we are seeing a more balancing of the economic development in China. Are you seeing any differential in growth from different regions? For example, first-tier cities versus some of the new locations, particularly any early indicators of growth in some of the new offices like Hunan province, et cetera?\nJacky Chan: Yes, I'm very happy to also continue to talk about Hong Kong and Mainland China. Firstly, although you say, oh, last year, first quarter, it was a low base for Hong Kong. But if you look at Hong Kong VONB in the first quarter this year, I want to say that the total first quarter VONB of Hong Kong actually surpassed the fourth quarter last year of Hong Kong. And within the MCV segment, actually, it has a double-digit growth. The MCV VONB of first quarter this year in Hong Kong, Macau has a double-digit growth over fourth quarter last year and so I would say this is really a strong -- yes, it's growing strong from strength from strength. And if you look at the AIA Hong Kong VONB for the month of March, it was the highest ever monthly VONB since the border reopened last year. So, I want to give you this kind of color to see that, right? Our Hong Kong and Macau business really is going from strength to strength. And very importantly, it's the underlying drivers. I keep talking about the underlying driver. So, the growth of first quarter of Hong Kong and Macau in this year is driven by increase in number of active agents and very strong double-digit growth in a number of new records and number of active new agents. And in respect to the MCV forecasted new recruit in first quarter this year, actually the number doubled compared to the MCV focused new recruit number in first quarter last year. So, this shows the underlying driver and the strength of the Hong Kong business. So, we don't give our forecast, but I want to say that, yes, with all these strong drivers, we have strong confidence about the long-term growth and sustainability of the Hong Kong business. Now in the case of Mainland China, I also want to say that we continue to reiterate, our growth in AIA China in the Mainland is broad-based. So, it is growth from both the so-called old geographies and new geographies. And we have a new -- we have five new provincial licenses since we got the subsidiarization in 2020. And those new provinces grew by 45% in the first quarter this year. And the growth is driven by, as I am now going to say, it is a strong double-digit growth of number of new recruit and number of active new agents across both the old geographies and the new geographies. And as I keep talking about giving some color on the AIA China differentiated agency model. We really continue to see a good case size, average case size from our AIA China agency channel as well as our differentiated bancassurance channel because we're really focusing on the middle income and above our customer segment. And those customer segments are more resilient in the current economic situation. So, this is what I want to say about Mainland China.\nLance Burbidge: Any other questions, Richard?\nRichard Xu: Just one follow-up question. I know the crackdown on some of the license brokers in Hong Kong is long-term positive. Any potential near-term impact in the second quarter? Are we expecting or would we be seeing no impact at all?\nJacky Chan: As I said, the so-called Hong Kong broker insurance actually for the long term is beneficial for the whole Hong Kong insurance industry and also for the broker channel for sustainable quality growth of MCV business. And in the case of AIA Hong Kong, you'll see our major MCV channel is still the agency, which is generating more than 60% of the MCV VONB. So as a whole, we really don't see any significant impact to the Hong Kong and Macau business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Chang of CGS International Securities. Michael, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nMichael Chang: I've got two questions. So, first question was on the MCV recruit. So, Jacky actually mentioned that it's doubling year-on-year. And I recall last year, you had a chart in the full year presentation Q-on-Q increasing every quarter. So, I'm assuming that means that it's still increased in Q-on-Q in the first quarter. But specifically, on the MCV new recruits. Can I just check how long do they take to become productive? So maybe how long do they take to reach average agent productivity levels for the new MCV recruits? Then secondly, on the capital. Garth just now mentioned the leverage ratio rising from 15% to 20%. Is there any timeframe for that? And then maybe how much tolerance do you have same event of doing any M&A in the future? Are you willing to go above that 20%? And then my just final comment. Absolutely love the transparency in terms of the numerical VONB growth rates you gave for some of the markets, especially Hong Kong, China. Can we get a commitment that given all this concern about -- from investors about Hong Kong, China growth rate that we can expect such transparency on a quarterly basis going forward for Hong Kong, China?\nJacky Chan: Yes, Michael, let me start with the MCV question. So actually, we see the new agent recruit, in particular, the MCV new recruit, actually, they are growing quarter-by-quarter since last year, since the border reopening. So, we do see continuous strong momentum in this new recruit. Now, as the -- when the new recruit will become effective, I want to let you know that in AIA Hong Kong, Macau, we employ a very sophisticated kind of selection interview. So, we have AI-based aptitude test and also AI-based interview before they come to see in-person interview. And furthermore, in terms of the requirement on new agents, we have a so-called M3-M6, meaning that the first three months, they had to achieve something. The first six months, the new recruit have to achieve something. Otherwise, they will fail. So, in the case of AIA, I want to say that I would say -- I would expect on average, the new recruit, they have to become active, able to contribute to a meaningful production in M3 and they continue to ramp up in M6. So, this is what we are working on in managing our new agents.\nGarth Jones: And on the debt, clearly, as I said earlier, the debt capacity we have, gives us additional financial flexibility. We're comfortable with our current financial ratings, and there is some capacity within the current ratings to extend the debt capacity further. That financial flexibility is important to us. But clearly, we look at the capital structure on a regular basis as well as looking at the capital levels we need. So, we keep assessing it on an ongoing basis.\nLance Burbidge: And then just on the disclosures. So, I'm glad you found it useful. Really, what we wanted to do is to give you reassurance in terms of the growth that we're seeing and our confidence in that growth. We don't manage the business quarter-to-quarter. So, we'll consider it for the future.\nMichael Chang: Sorry, can I just follow-up. Yes. On the capital management, can you just elaborate on what the considerations are for buybacks versus dividends? Under what condition would you actually raise say your dividends maybe relative to operating profit?\nGarth Jones: Yes. I think the key thing within the framework we've set out is that, firstly, we look at the underlying free surplus generation, net free surplus generation as being the basis that is more representative of shareholder capital. Clearly, we have earnings as well and earnings growth, but earnings represent accounting profits, and we think that the underlying free surplus generation and net free surplus generation, in particular, after allowing for new business growth is a better way to look at the shareholder capital position.\nOperator: The next question comes from Edwin Liu of CLSA. Edwin, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nEdwin Liu: And congratulations on a very good set of results. Just can I ask on Hong Kong. I noted that the domestic segment also grew by nicely at double-digit growth. Can you just talk about what is driving such growth given we are sitting in Hong Kong local economies not that great? Any color would be appreciated, whether it is volume-driven or marginal assumption, et cetera. And if I can follow up on previous analyst's question on new recruits for MCV. We are very positive on this trend. But just noted that the Hong Kong government's talent visa may be slowing down a bit. Just from a longer-term perspective, would the recruitment be slowing down if we look at, say, next two or three years in terms of the MCV-focused agent recruitment? And just lastly, if I can squeeze one more question. I know you haven't disclosed it in the quarterly result in terms of the operating profit after tax. Can we get color on the trend? Has it turned positive in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis?\nJacky Chan: So let me also give you some more color. I'm also very happy to say that our Hong Kong Macau business actually has broad-based growth have you already mentioned. The domestic also grew strongly in the first quarter. And the growth is continuously supported by the underlying driver is the active new agent and the new recruit. Actually, we also have good growth in the active new agent and active -- and also to recruit in the domestic segment. And first of all, in fact, we don't see a so-called -- very strong so-called correlation usually in the so-called economic cycle and the life insurance industry because under whatever cycle, customers still need long-term financial planning. And even in the so-called economic downturn, the customer really need to assess, right, the financial risk in terms of protection this, et cetera. So, we continue to be able to penetrate the domestic customer segment because of the aging population, we continue to say that the need for retirement saving is quick and also the need for health care and health insurance continue to be a great test line. AIA Group, we have our integrated health care strategy. And Hong Kong, we are also executing their health care strategy. So, we do see these are the underlying drivers that will continue to drive the growth of the domestic business. And in terms of the MCV recruit and sustainability, I think we have been talking about this. So, if you look at the number of daily average MCV visitor to Hong Kong in the first quarter, that was about 91,000 that has already increased growing from the 2023 overall whole year daily average MCV visitor. And this number hasn't right, go back to the pandemic height. And as I continue to mention, right, the demand for quality, U.S. dollar long-term saving product from the MCV customer remains strong and Hong Kong remain -- and those MCV customers in terms of new policy sales, over 50% is protection, the critical unit policy, our high-end medical insurance policy continue to attract the attention of the MCV customer. And this kind of strong underlying driver, I would say, will remain very strong going forward. So, I really would like to say that, yes, we see the long-term sustainability of the MCV business in Hong Kong.\nLance Burbidge: Any follow-ups there, Edwin?\nEdwin Liu: Just the question on operating profit after tax.\nLance Burbidge: Can you repeat the question, sorry?\nEdwin Liu: Just want to confirm or any color from you in terms of the operating -- OPAT trend in the first quarter?\nGarth Jones: Yes, thanks. Yes, as I mentioned a few times now, the VONB growth translates into OPAT growth and UFSG growth over time. I should say that we noted some recent volatility in the consensus forecast on OPAT on some of the financial platforms, but the current estimates seem to be much more sensible, and you'll see that come through when we announce our results at the half year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michelle Ma of Citi. Michelle, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nMichelle Ma: This is Michelle from Citi. I have two questions. First is on the -- I'm trying to understand the pace of buyback as I observed in the past three weeks, the pace of buyback actually slowed down quite a lot despite greater share price volatility in the past couple of weeks. So, I understand that's a fully automated program. So, could you shed some light on what's the key factors embedded in this automated buyback programs such as volatility or absolute share price level or the remaining quota left? So, what's the major factors determine the buyback pace? Second is on China. So, I think compared to other regions, China is quite unique because of the capital control and the decreasing interest rates. So -- and also very limited supply of long-duration assets available in the market. So, I think one concern is the potential mismatch between asset and liability. So, could you shed some light on the China's asset and the liability duration, respectively? And also, if we have 50 bps cut in the investment assumption, just for China EV, what will be the sensitivity?\nGarth Jones: Yes, on the first point, the buyback. What we do is we provide an instruction to the broker to buyback a certain amount of shares over a certain amount of time. And with that, we then hand that to the broker to execute. That enables us to continue to buy back the shares during the blackout periods, which we otherwise wouldn't be able to do. And that then is the decision of the broker each day to buyback how many shares. In terms of China, I should say that we've continued to focus on protection business, as Jacky just outlined. And in terms of the investment, we've been buying long-dated government bonds for many, many years now and you see that in our asset mix. These produce healthy yields. And if you look at the investment portfolio, you'd find that the majority of it has a duration of more than 30 years. You'll also note that recently, the government in China has been indicating that it will provide a greater supply of long-term bonds and indeed, they are supportive of having interest rates that are higher than the current levels. So, with all of that, we remain very comfortable with the asset side as well as -- and as you know, we start with the liabilities. And when we look at the asset side, we remain comfortable with both.\nJacky Chan: Yes. Maybe I may -- Michelle, maybe I may add that, as I said, in first quarter this year in Mainland China, we have participating product, so for agency channel, which make up about 10% of the VONB first quarter and the participating product has much lower in interest rate. So, in view of, for example, you talk about decreasing interest rate, then AIA China will continue to reprice product and continue to roll out more participating products with much lower current interest rate.\nLance Burbidge: Any more questions?\nOperator: We don't have any more questions from the participants. I will now pass it back to Lance to conclude today's session.\nLance Burbidge: Great. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for listening and participating. If you have any follow-up questions, which I think Garth has volunteered there are for quite a few, please come through to us at Investor Relations. And thanks very much, and good morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes AIA's first quarter 2024 update analyst Q&A. Thank you for your participation.",

      "transcript": "Lance Burbidge: Good morning from AIA Central in Hong Kong. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 update Q&A session. I'm Lance Burbidge, Chief Investor Relations Officer for AIA Group. Together with me today are Lee Yuan Siong, our Group CEO and President; and Garth Jones, our group CFO. We also have other members of the group executive committee either with us in the room or joining us remotely. Before we start the Q&A, Yuan Siong and Garth will take you through a short presentation on our first quarter new business performance and our new capital management policy. Yuan Siong.\nLee Yuan Siong: Good morning, everyone. Today, I'm very pleased to announce our policy, clearly demonstrating the strength of AIA's business model and our financial discipline. Value of new business for the group grew by 31% in the first quarter of 2024. We delivered AIA's highest ever quarterly new business result, building on our very strong VONB performance in 2023. Our new capital management policy provides greater clarity as to how we will deliver higher annual capital returns to shareholders. Following this new policy, the Board has approved a further $2 billion buyback, which increases our existing share buyback program to a total of $12 billion. I'm confident that AIA is exceptionally well positioned to capture the highly attractive opportunities available to us across the region. We continue to focus on driving high-quality profitable new business group that delivers increased future earnings, free surplus generation and greater shareholder value. Let me now take you through the first quarter new business highlights. VONB was $1.3 billion, a record high for a quarter and up by 31%. We delivered double-digit growth from all our reportable segments with VONB margin increasing by 2.1 percentage points to 54.2%. AIA China was up 38%, driven by very strong double-digit growth from our Premier Agency, supplemented by growth from our highly selective bancassurance partners, where VONB margin increased to around 40%. Growth was broad-based across our established operations and new branches and the VONB margin for AIA China increased further from the second half of 2023 to 54.6%. AIA Hong Kong grew by 43% with double-digit growth from both the domestic and Mainland Chinese visitor customer segments. New business from Mainland Chinese visitors continue to build momentum with VONB in the first quarter higher than in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our three largest ASEAN markets, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia, all grew by double digits, with combined VONB growth of 16%, and our Other Markets segment was up by 10% with excellent growth from Tata AIA Life in India and strong performances from Australia, the Philippines and South Korea. Today's announcement clearly demonstrates the strength and diversification of AIA's businesses, which enables us to capture the significant growth opportunities across Asia and deliver capital returns to shareholders. I will now hand over to Garth.\nGarth Jones: Thank you, Yuan Siong. There are two key components to our enhanced capital management policy announced today. The first component is an annual payout target rate ratio target that supplements our progressive dividend policy with annual share buybacks. The second component is a commitment to regularly review our capital position and return capital that is access to our needs at least annually. As a result of this, we are adding $2 billion to our existing share buyback program. We expect this to commence as soon as practicable and to complete in our own 12 months. Let me now explain how this policy works in practice and how we assess our capital position from a shareholder's perspective. While the group LCSM surplus is our principal regulatory solvency measure, we've always said that free surplus provides a more representative view of the capital position for shareholders. Since the introduction of the LCSM framework, we've shown a reconciliation of the group LCSM surplus and free surplus consistently in our interim and annual results. Free surplus removes items included in the LCSM that are not available for distribution to shareholders, for example, the surplus within par funds. We calculate the group's total capital resources by adding free surplus to eligible Tier 2 debt and required capital. On this basis, the ratio of total capital resources to required capital was 269% at the end of 2023. The first priority within our capital management framework is to maintain a strong and resilient balance sheet. While required capital includes the prescribed capital levels for our various businesses set by our regulators, we hold additional capital that allows us to withstand a range of extreme but plausible stress scenarios, whilst also ensuring we do not constrain organic new business growth. For example, we include a repeat of the, GFC, pandemics, persistent high and low interest rate scenarios. We also allow for combinations of these scenarios at the same time. Based on our assessment of our current capital needs, including these scenarios, we target for shareholder total capital resources to comfortably exceed 200% of required capital. On completion of the remaining $2.8 billion from the existing share buyback program, together with the additional $2 billion buyback announced today are free surplus on a pro forma basis as at the end of 2023, reduces to $11.5 billion. The pro forma ratio of shareholder total capital resources to required capital reduces to 238%. Our new enhanced capital management policy provides greater clarity and will deliver higher annual capital returns to shareholders. Starting from our 2024 annual results, we will target a payout ratio of 75% of annual net free surplus generation through dividends and share buybacks. Net free surplus generation is calculated as shown using figures that we have consistently included in our results announcement. Net free surplus generation is calculated before investment return variances. While investment return variances, foreign exchange and other nonoperating items create free surplus volatility from year-to-year, they have averaged under $80 million a year since our IPO. This formulaic approach automatically adjusts for further organic investment in profitable new business. As we grow the business, the balance sheet and required capital will increase, driving the need to retain some net free surplus generated. However, with a 75% payout ratio, we expect the total capital resources to required capital ratio to fall over time from 238% as we grow and regularly return capital to shareholders. For clarity and completeness, our policy of delivering prudent, sustainable and progressive dividends remains unchanged. The balance of the payout above dividends with a target 75% aggregate payout ratio will be provided by way of share buybacks announced at the annual results each year. Let me now illustrate how our capital management policy will work in practice based on our 2023 annual results. As I said, there are two components to the policy, and it is important to consider these together. Net free surplus generation was $3.9 billion after new business investment of $1.3 billion. Under the first component of the policy based on the 75% payout ratio target, $2.9 billion would have been returned to shareholders. The 2023 interim and final dividends totaled $2.3 billion. The $0.6 billion balance would therefore come in the form of an additional share buyback. We will announce this year's net FSG, final dividend and additional share buyback at our 2024 annual results. Under the second component of the policy, the regular review of our capital position, we have today added $2 billion to our existing share buyback program. This is in addition to the $2.8 billion we will return in 2024 and the annual dividend payment. Together, these amount to roughly 10% of our recent market capitalization. In conclusion, you can see that overall, our new capital management policy provides both greater clarity and higher capital returns to shareholders. I'll now hand back to you, Yuan Siong.\nLee Yuan Siong: Thank you, Garth. In closing, today's very strong new business growth, combined with the clarity from our new capital management policy clearly demonstrate the strength of AIA's significant competitive advantages, operational delivery and financial discipline. We have the right strategic priorities and our consistent execution gives me great confidence that we can continue to deliver significant value creation for our shareholders. Over to you, Lance.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Yuan Siong. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. So over to you, operator. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Charles Zhou of UBS Security. Charles, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nCheng Zhou: So, congratulations. I think it's a very strong set of results. And also finally, we got more clarity about -- congratulations. I think it's a very strong set of results. And also finally, we're glad to see some clarity about the enhanced capital management plan. So, I've got two questions for management. First, some of your peers have provided a long-term target for the underlying for surplus or maybe some free surplus. So, can you maybe -- does AIA have any targets or can you talk about any targets for the long term, otherwise, any colors or key consideration in thinking about the net free surplus generation will be very helpful because I guess, we need to do some projection here? And second, after the recent regulatory inspection on the MCV focused brokers in Hong Kong, I would like to hear from management, what do you think about the outlook for this channel in second quarter and also beyond? And also, AIA Hong Kong growth prospects as a whole, do you think this is an individual event? Or does it indicate a wider clamp down such as capital control on the MCV business?\nGarth Jones: Yes. Firstly -- thanks, Charles. I understand the need to try to project this in some way forward. I think the important thing to remember is that as with our metrics on earnings, similarly, there are successive layers that we put on a profitable new business translate into underlying free surplus generation. So, as we explained, I think, at the full year, as you add further new business layers, those add to earnings. They improved the ROE and then also the add-on to the free surplus generation going forward. This layering comes through. I suggest in terms of forecasting, it's probably better to talk to our IR team and get technical support. There are a few elements to put in there. Why we thought of net free surplus generation was that then clearly, the best way we can create value for shareholders is by growing the business organically and then the higher the new business strain, and that will obviously impact net free surplus generation, but that will indicate that we are growing the business very strongly and creating greater value for shareholders.\nLee Yuan Siong: I would just add that the underlying free plus generation is a very key metric that the management is very focused on. It is one of the key metrics in our short-term incentive program, and we intend to introduce this as another metric in our long-term incentive program as well. So, it is a very important metric that the management is very focused on.\nJacky Chan: Thank you for the question on the MCV broker. First of all, the investigation by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority and ICAC, it is still under investigation, and the identity of the broker has not been disclosed. First of all, I want to let you know that, in fact, since the border will be opened in last year, the Hong Kong life insurance industry has been in discussion with the Hong Kong Insurance Authority to keep review and investigate the sales package of certain sales intermediates to ensure full compliance of the MCV business and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the MCV business. And in the case of AIA, you all -- you know that AIA holds a very high standard on compliance, on MCV policies. We require the MCV customer to be passed in Hong Kong or Macau and our staff at the WalletSafe Center will meet with the customer, we will ensure all the proper documentation, et cetera. And also, we carry out welcome call to check the MCV customer on the sales process, et cetera. So, in fact, AIA very welcome, the initiative taken by Hong Kong Insurance Authority in this case. And as I said, this is still under investigation, but in view of the heightened risk of this concerned broker, AIA Hong Kong already suspended new business coming from this broker. First of all, I really want to reiterate that the MCV business is a business in the Hong Kong insurance industry for almost more than two decades, and the MCV customer flow coming to Hong Kong remain very strong. And in the case of AIA, we have a diversified distribution channels and our core agency channel actually took up more than 60% of the MCV business of AIA Hong Kong and the rest is coming from our diversified bank assurance partnership and more than 100 brokers. So, we see that the so-called short-term impact from this broker to Hong Kong -- to AIA actually is very, very minimal. And in fact, this will really help the long-term sustainability of the MCV business through the broker channel.\nLee Yuan Siong: Yes, I agree with Jacky, and I really welcome the actions taken by the Hong Kong AIA because I believe it will support the long-term sustainability of MCV business in the Hong Kong market.\nLance Burbidge: Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Thomas Wang of Goldman Sachs. Thomas, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nThomas Wang: A couple of questions. Firstly, I just wanted a little bit more detail on our total capital target of comfortably above 200%. Can you share a little bit more color on that? And how you think about free service and eligible debt mix within the resources? How about comfortable you -- how much sort of are you comfortable raising that use of eligible debt to capital resources? Sorry, the other thing is Mainland China. Can you talk about the bancassurance and agency mix in terms of sales of VONB in the first quarter? And then have you kind of completed with the rollout of bancassurance as this is the sort of the major rollout of bancassurance channel? And how do you see that mix evolve for the rest of the year and into next year?\nGarth Jones: As we showed earlier, we're targeting this shareholder capital ratio that comfortably exceeds 200%, and when we look at reviewing our capital position regularly and looking at the capital that is in excess of our needs, that also includes optimizing our overall capital structure, depending on debt market capacity and conditions. Clearly, the group retains additional financial flexibility from its debt capacity. And from a ratio perspective, our current credit ratings, our Moody's leverage ratio could go up from the current around 15% to around 20%. But we're comfortable with our current financial ratings. Clearly, our business is a life insurance business. It's retail. It's not as sensitive to credit ratings as say, commercial non-life insurance. But we do look at both the amount of capital we need and the structure of that capital on an ongoing basis in order to optimize both.\nJacky Chan: Thomas, let me take you through our very strong AIA China result in the first quarter. We are very pleased that the growth is broad-based across both agency and also bancassurance channel. Furthermore, our protection VONB also grew double digit in the first quarter this year. Our agency remains our core channel and the agency growth is driven by growth in a number of active agents and more than 20% growth in a number of new vehicles and a number of new active agents. And this is a broad-based and the ANP per active agent also grew strongly in first quarter. So, our agency really continued to perform very well in both protection and long-term savings products. As our differentiated bancassurance, we continue to focus on our partner, our strategic partners, banks, including China Postal Group, Bank of East Asia, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and Bank of China. We've continued to focus on the affluent and above customer segment and the average case size speed for itself. It is a very, very strong average case size. Our bancassurance profitability actually also improved in the first quarter from last year, first quarter to this year, first quarter that was almost a VONB margin of 40%. So, we are very pleased with this differentiated bancassurance channel. And in the first quarter, the bancassurance channel contributed roughly 15% of our total VONB of China. We continue to be very bullish about the outlook of our AIA China business in Mainland China.\nLance Burbidge: Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from MW Kim of JPMorgan. MW, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nMW Kim: And really appreciate your quarterly management call. Following this announcement, as previously mentioned, the underlying free surplus generation perhaps become more important, the figure to the shareholders and broad stakeholder. So, my first question is about the management KPI. Currently, the new business value has a larger weight in the management KPI. Would you expect potentially higher weight on underlying free surplus generation in short-term incentive scheme moving forward? And next question is about India. As the Company commented in the report, India joint venture seem to enjoy excellent journey with bigger scale. Would you expect a more detailed number in the India business in the foreseeable future?\nLee Yuan Siong: Now in terms of the nature of our business is a long-term business. And as you know, writing profitable new business is key to supporting our future earnings and future free surplus generation. So, we will continue to be very focused on our VONB, and it will be -- it will continue to be the most important metric in our incentive programs, right? I've mentioned just now that we are very focused on operating profit. We are focused on EV. We are very focused on underlying free surplus generation. And as a result, we are introducing the underlying free surplus generation as a new metric to the LTI program. And this is -- this will allow us to have additional focus on the UFSG number going forward.\nGarth Jones: We -- just to add, we've always said that VONB is a leading indicator. And as I just mentioned, that leading indicator of VONB then translates into a stream of earnings, a stream of free surplus going forward. And so that leading indicator will be -- continue to be important. What you'll then see is that the earnings and the free service will come through, and it's important then we look at those, and that reflects then the ongoing operating performance and management of the in-force, clearly, we'll look at managing the capital. So, we're managing the E as well as the R in order to further improve our ROE over time. On India, as you say, excellent growth in India. We're very excited about that business. It continues to perform very, very well. And I think, you'll see increasingly more information coming from that. Clearly, there's a lot of information in the local market that's available in addition to what we provide. And we'll look to keep people well informed of our developments there because we think it's a key growth engine for the future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kailesh Mistry of HSBC. Kailesh, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nKailesh Mistry: Thank you for the incremental disclosure today on capital management and new business. However, I've got three questions. The first set of questions are on capital management and the modeling of that. I guess one of the key assumptions is required capital. That grew by about 10% per annum over the last five years. Is this a reasonable assumption going forward? Or should it be higher given the new business growth? On eligible debt, just to follow-up on the previous answer. I think, Garth mentioned you had additional capacity of 5 percentage points on the Moody's calculation. Just to clarify, is that all eligible for an LCSM basis, which I think is the number that's included in this calculation? Secondly, just on China. What was the product mix in the first quarter versus 2023? I guess, split between pensions protection and the other savings business? And on Hong Kong offshore, again, what was the product mix? Did we see a bounce back in protection and the savings case sizes held up?\nGarth Jones: In terms of the required capital, you'd expect that to grow in line with the business. I think the important thing to look at is the free surplus overall rather than just being fixated on a ratio. Clearly, the free surplus will continue to grow. I think the key thing will be to sort of have a broad model of the business and maybe again, the best thing to do will be to talk to the IR team to work through how that might be best done. But as we said, we expect that ratio of free surplus to require capital to continue to fall over time based on the 75% payout ratio of net free surplus generation, and we'll continue to review that on an annual basis at least and see where we are. In terms of the eligible debt, clearly, the room we have in terms of the ratings does vary by a rating agency. We've quoted the Moody's number here. It does provide us with important financial flexibility for whatever purpose. And clearly, you also have to consider the capacity of debt markets and structuring and so on at the same time as well. So, a number of things to think about. In terms of the LCSM. The LCSM clearly includes regulatory eligible debt. There are different conditions for that and for ratings agency eligible debt, they are broadly similar. And each rating agency, as you know, has different criteria. So, we look to have debt that covers all of those different requirements and be eligible for both ratings and for solvency, but there are differences between each basis.\nJacky Chan: On product mix, China. So, there are really some differences because AIA China always innovate our product and keep in place in the competitive market. So last year, first quarter, we didn't have the tax deferred personal pension benefit. Last year, first quarter, we only saw very, very small personnel participating business. And also last year, first quarter, we have -- we roll out the first in the market, the so-called simplified use of CI. So, it is quite different in the agency channel. So, this year, first quarter in the agency channel, the tax deferred personal pension time actually is one of our top selling products in the agency channel, and they also help our new agent and also our agents in general to acquire new customers. And then secondly, we continue to focus on CI, our flagship, as you wish [indiscernible] product has growth in the first quarter this year compared to last year first quarter. And overall, our total potential UMB has strong double-digit growth as we also focused on a lot of those renewable medical and in some business in the agency channel. And lastly, in the agency channel. In this year, we roll out participating products. And in first quarter, it made up about 10% of our agency VONB. So, this gives you a feel of that difference. But as a whole, the agency channel VONB margin, even though the interest rate comes down. We already adopt the China association, interest rate in the VONB and our agency VONB margins still hold up at about 60% at a similar level compared to our first quarter last year. As to our bancassurance channel, our differentiated bancassurance channel, as I said, the margin increased to 40%. And the bancassurance channel continue to sell a lot of a mix of long-term saving product and long-term protection products. So that is about the product mix of a China in the first quarter. As to Hong Kong, the MCV product mix roughly remain -- roughly remain unchanged. The protection sales remain to contribute more than 50% by new business policies. And the average case size of the MCV business roughly hold up at about US$19,000, similar level as last year, whole year. And our long-term saving product continue to be very welcome by the MCV customer. So basically, I would say, in the case of AIA Hong Kong Macau, the MCV product mix roughly is similar to the last year level.\nLance Burbidge: Any follow-up questions, Kailesh?\nKailesh Mistry: No follow-up questions, but just a sort of request, I guess, some of your peers do allow us to model that required capital a little bit more clearly. So that additional level of disclosure might be helpful. And similarly, on the undiscounted VIF profit emergence, which I think you currently put in five-year buckets. But yes, those would be two requests for disclosure, I guess.\nLance Burbidge: Understood. Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Xu of Morgan Stanley. Richard, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nRichard Xu: Again, very congrats on a very solid first quarter. Two questions from me. One is, obviously, some of these strong numbers was still probably helped by low base. For Hong Kong going forward, for example, for second quarter was high base last year and then going for the full year based on the current trends, what are some of the guidance expectations for growth for first half and then maybe any guidance for -- a little bit further for that? And second question is on China. Obviously, China is going through some transition. Certainly, we are seeing a more balancing of the economic development in China. Are you seeing any differential in growth from different regions? For example, first-tier cities versus some of the new locations, particularly any early indicators of growth in some of the new offices like Hunan province, et cetera?\nJacky Chan: Yes, I'm very happy to also continue to talk about Hong Kong and Mainland China. Firstly, although you say, oh, last year, first quarter, it was a low base for Hong Kong. But if you look at Hong Kong VONB in the first quarter this year, I want to say that the total first quarter VONB of Hong Kong actually surpassed the fourth quarter last year of Hong Kong. And within the MCV segment, actually, it has a double-digit growth. The MCV VONB of first quarter this year in Hong Kong, Macau has a double-digit growth over fourth quarter last year and so I would say this is really a strong -- yes, it's growing strong from strength from strength. And if you look at the AIA Hong Kong VONB for the month of March, it was the highest ever monthly VONB since the border reopened last year. So, I want to give you this kind of color to see that, right? Our Hong Kong and Macau business really is going from strength to strength. And very importantly, it's the underlying drivers. I keep talking about the underlying driver. So, the growth of first quarter of Hong Kong and Macau in this year is driven by increase in number of active agents and very strong double-digit growth in a number of new records and number of active new agents. And in respect to the MCV forecasted new recruit in first quarter this year, actually the number doubled compared to the MCV focused new recruit number in first quarter last year. So, this shows the underlying driver and the strength of the Hong Kong business. So, we don't give our forecast, but I want to say that, yes, with all these strong drivers, we have strong confidence about the long-term growth and sustainability of the Hong Kong business. Now in the case of Mainland China, I also want to say that we continue to reiterate, our growth in AIA China in the Mainland is broad-based. So, it is growth from both the so-called old geographies and new geographies. And we have a new -- we have five new provincial licenses since we got the subsidiarization in 2020. And those new provinces grew by 45% in the first quarter this year. And the growth is driven by, as I am now going to say, it is a strong double-digit growth of number of new recruit and number of active new agents across both the old geographies and the new geographies. And as I keep talking about giving some color on the AIA China differentiated agency model. We really continue to see a good case size, average case size from our AIA China agency channel as well as our differentiated bancassurance channel because we're really focusing on the middle income and above our customer segment. And those customer segments are more resilient in the current economic situation. So, this is what I want to say about Mainland China.\nLance Burbidge: Any other questions, Richard?\nRichard Xu: Just one follow-up question. I know the crackdown on some of the license brokers in Hong Kong is long-term positive. Any potential near-term impact in the second quarter? Are we expecting or would we be seeing no impact at all?\nJacky Chan: As I said, the so-called Hong Kong broker insurance actually for the long term is beneficial for the whole Hong Kong insurance industry and also for the broker channel for sustainable quality growth of MCV business. And in the case of AIA Hong Kong, you'll see our major MCV channel is still the agency, which is generating more than 60% of the MCV VONB. So as a whole, we really don't see any significant impact to the Hong Kong and Macau business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Chang of CGS International Securities. Michael, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nMichael Chang: I've got two questions. So, first question was on the MCV recruit. So, Jacky actually mentioned that it's doubling year-on-year. And I recall last year, you had a chart in the full year presentation Q-on-Q increasing every quarter. So, I'm assuming that means that it's still increased in Q-on-Q in the first quarter. But specifically, on the MCV new recruits. Can I just check how long do they take to become productive? So maybe how long do they take to reach average agent productivity levels for the new MCV recruits? Then secondly, on the capital. Garth just now mentioned the leverage ratio rising from 15% to 20%. Is there any timeframe for that? And then maybe how much tolerance do you have same event of doing any M&A in the future? Are you willing to go above that 20%? And then my just final comment. Absolutely love the transparency in terms of the numerical VONB growth rates you gave for some of the markets, especially Hong Kong, China. Can we get a commitment that given all this concern about -- from investors about Hong Kong, China growth rate that we can expect such transparency on a quarterly basis going forward for Hong Kong, China?\nJacky Chan: Yes, Michael, let me start with the MCV question. So actually, we see the new agent recruit, in particular, the MCV new recruit, actually, they are growing quarter-by-quarter since last year, since the border reopening. So, we do see continuous strong momentum in this new recruit. Now, as the -- when the new recruit will become effective, I want to let you know that in AIA Hong Kong, Macau, we employ a very sophisticated kind of selection interview. So, we have AI-based aptitude test and also AI-based interview before they come to see in-person interview. And furthermore, in terms of the requirement on new agents, we have a so-called M3-M6, meaning that the first three months, they had to achieve something. The first six months, the new recruit have to achieve something. Otherwise, they will fail. So, in the case of AIA, I want to say that I would say -- I would expect on average, the new recruit, they have to become active, able to contribute to a meaningful production in M3 and they continue to ramp up in M6. So, this is what we are working on in managing our new agents.\nGarth Jones: And on the debt, clearly, as I said earlier, the debt capacity we have, gives us additional financial flexibility. We're comfortable with our current financial ratings, and there is some capacity within the current ratings to extend the debt capacity further. That financial flexibility is important to us. But clearly, we look at the capital structure on a regular basis as well as looking at the capital levels we need. So, we keep assessing it on an ongoing basis.\nLance Burbidge: And then just on the disclosures. So, I'm glad you found it useful. Really, what we wanted to do is to give you reassurance in terms of the growth that we're seeing and our confidence in that growth. We don't manage the business quarter-to-quarter. So, we'll consider it for the future.\nMichael Chang: Sorry, can I just follow-up. Yes. On the capital management, can you just elaborate on what the considerations are for buybacks versus dividends? Under what condition would you actually raise say your dividends maybe relative to operating profit?\nGarth Jones: Yes. I think the key thing within the framework we've set out is that, firstly, we look at the underlying free surplus generation, net free surplus generation as being the basis that is more representative of shareholder capital. Clearly, we have earnings as well and earnings growth, but earnings represent accounting profits, and we think that the underlying free surplus generation and net free surplus generation, in particular, after allowing for new business growth is a better way to look at the shareholder capital position.\nOperator: The next question comes from Edwin Liu of CLSA. Edwin, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nEdwin Liu: And congratulations on a very good set of results. Just can I ask on Hong Kong. I noted that the domestic segment also grew by nicely at double-digit growth. Can you just talk about what is driving such growth given we are sitting in Hong Kong local economies not that great? Any color would be appreciated, whether it is volume-driven or marginal assumption, et cetera. And if I can follow up on previous analyst's question on new recruits for MCV. We are very positive on this trend. But just noted that the Hong Kong government's talent visa may be slowing down a bit. Just from a longer-term perspective, would the recruitment be slowing down if we look at, say, next two or three years in terms of the MCV-focused agent recruitment? And just lastly, if I can squeeze one more question. I know you haven't disclosed it in the quarterly result in terms of the operating profit after tax. Can we get color on the trend? Has it turned positive in the first quarter on a year-on-year basis?\nJacky Chan: So let me also give you some more color. I'm also very happy to say that our Hong Kong Macau business actually has broad-based growth have you already mentioned. The domestic also grew strongly in the first quarter. And the growth is continuously supported by the underlying driver is the active new agent and the new recruit. Actually, we also have good growth in the active new agent and active -- and also to recruit in the domestic segment. And first of all, in fact, we don't see a so-called -- very strong so-called correlation usually in the so-called economic cycle and the life insurance industry because under whatever cycle, customers still need long-term financial planning. And even in the so-called economic downturn, the customer really need to assess, right, the financial risk in terms of protection this, et cetera. So, we continue to be able to penetrate the domestic customer segment because of the aging population, we continue to say that the need for retirement saving is quick and also the need for health care and health insurance continue to be a great test line. AIA Group, we have our integrated health care strategy. And Hong Kong, we are also executing their health care strategy. So, we do see these are the underlying drivers that will continue to drive the growth of the domestic business. And in terms of the MCV recruit and sustainability, I think we have been talking about this. So, if you look at the number of daily average MCV visitor to Hong Kong in the first quarter, that was about 91,000 that has already increased growing from the 2023 overall whole year daily average MCV visitor. And this number hasn't right, go back to the pandemic height. And as I continue to mention, right, the demand for quality, U.S. dollar long-term saving product from the MCV customer remains strong and Hong Kong remain -- and those MCV customers in terms of new policy sales, over 50% is protection, the critical unit policy, our high-end medical insurance policy continue to attract the attention of the MCV customer. And this kind of strong underlying driver, I would say, will remain very strong going forward. So, I really would like to say that, yes, we see the long-term sustainability of the MCV business in Hong Kong.\nLance Burbidge: Any follow-ups there, Edwin?\nEdwin Liu: Just the question on operating profit after tax.\nLance Burbidge: Can you repeat the question, sorry?\nEdwin Liu: Just want to confirm or any color from you in terms of the operating -- OPAT trend in the first quarter?\nGarth Jones: Yes, thanks. Yes, as I mentioned a few times now, the VONB growth translates into OPAT growth and UFSG growth over time. I should say that we noted some recent volatility in the consensus forecast on OPAT on some of the financial platforms, but the current estimates seem to be much more sensible, and you'll see that come through when we announce our results at the half year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michelle Ma of Citi. Michelle, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nMichelle Ma: This is Michelle from Citi. I have two questions. First is on the -- I'm trying to understand the pace of buyback as I observed in the past three weeks, the pace of buyback actually slowed down quite a lot despite greater share price volatility in the past couple of weeks. So, I understand that's a fully automated program. So, could you shed some light on what's the key factors embedded in this automated buyback programs such as volatility or absolute share price level or the remaining quota left? So, what's the major factors determine the buyback pace? Second is on China. So, I think compared to other regions, China is quite unique because of the capital control and the decreasing interest rates. So -- and also very limited supply of long-duration assets available in the market. So, I think one concern is the potential mismatch between asset and liability. So, could you shed some light on the China's asset and the liability duration, respectively? And also, if we have 50 bps cut in the investment assumption, just for China EV, what will be the sensitivity?\nGarth Jones: Yes, on the first point, the buyback. What we do is we provide an instruction to the broker to buyback a certain amount of shares over a certain amount of time. And with that, we then hand that to the broker to execute. That enables us to continue to buy back the shares during the blackout periods, which we otherwise wouldn't be able to do. And that then is the decision of the broker each day to buyback how many shares. In terms of China, I should say that we've continued to focus on protection business, as Jacky just outlined. And in terms of the investment, we've been buying long-dated government bonds for many, many years now and you see that in our asset mix. These produce healthy yields. And if you look at the investment portfolio, you'd find that the majority of it has a duration of more than 30 years. You'll also note that recently, the government in China has been indicating that it will provide a greater supply of long-term bonds and indeed, they are supportive of having interest rates that are higher than the current levels. So, with all of that, we remain very comfortable with the asset side as well as -- and as you know, we start with the liabilities. And when we look at the asset side, we remain comfortable with both.\nJacky Chan: Yes. Maybe I may -- Michelle, maybe I may add that, as I said, in first quarter this year in Mainland China, we have participating product, so for agency channel, which make up about 10% of the VONB first quarter and the participating product has much lower in interest rate. So, in view of, for example, you talk about decreasing interest rate, then AIA China will continue to reprice product and continue to roll out more participating products with much lower current interest rate.\nLance Burbidge: Any more questions?\nOperator: We don't have any more questions from the participants. I will now pass it back to Lance to conclude today's session.\nLance Burbidge: Great. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for listening and participating. If you have any follow-up questions, which I think Garth has volunteered there are for quite a few, please come through to us at Investor Relations. And thanks very much, and good morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes AIA's first quarter 2024 update analyst Q&A. Thank you for your participation.",

    "fullTranscript": "Lee Yuan Siong: Good morning from Hong Kong. And a warm welcome to AIA’s Annual Results Presentation for 2023. Today, AIA has announced a return to very strong profitable new business growth, with VONB up 33% to over $4 billion and ANP at a record high. New business growth is the key driver of the 37% increase in EV operating profit per share and a 350 basis point uplift in operating return on EV to 12.9%. Operating profit after tax was up 7% per share on an underlying basis. We grew our CSM, the stock of future OPAT by 8.4% on an underlying basis, and operating return on equity was up by 50 basis points to 13.5%.  Strong capital generation saw a free surplus increased by 25%, before capital returns of $2.3 billion in dividends and $3.6 billion through the buyback. None of these returns to shareholders, our capital position remains very strong, with free surplus up $16.3 billion. Total dividend per share is up 5% and we have returned $7.2 billion through our ongoing share buyback program. These results again demonstrate the power of AIA's business model that enables us to capture the growth opportunities across Asia and deliver cash returns to shareholders.  Let me explain how we have achieved these strong results before Garth provides more detail on the financials. We have four key growth engines, which together generate 95% of the group's VONB and each of them reported double digit growth in 2023. ASEAN, our largest engine delivered over $1.5 billion, which is more than one-third of the group's total. Excluding Vietnam, where industry wide issues have been impacted new business sales, ASEAN was up 14%, driven by increased productivity from both agency and partnerships, alongside our focus on protection and unit link sales.  When Hong Kong fully reopened in February, we were ready to capture the returning demand from Mainland Chinese visitors for high quality comprehensive suite of products through our multi-channel distribution. Sales to the domestic customer segment also increase, resulting in an overall growth of 82% for AIA Hong Kong.  This excellent performance confirms, AIA as the overall market leader as well as number one in agency and the retail IA channels. And our leading agency is an attractive career choice with new recruits up by 59%. AIA China grew by 28% from February to December, following the removal of pandemic restrictions. Our high quality premier agency generated over 90% of China's VONB with margins exceeding 60% in the second half, and agent productivity more than double that of our peers.  Our joint venture in India, Tata AIA Life, ranked as the third largest private life insurer in 2023 and continue his track record across all channels with VONB up 37%. AIA's excellent new business performance was broad-base across our high quality growth engines, which are powered by an unrivaled distribution platform. Premier agency is at the heart of AIA's distribution and a key competitive advantage, generating over 75% of new business in 2023.  VONB grew by 23%, driven by an increase in active agent numbers and higher productivity. Full adoption of digital tools across the entire premier agency value chain has delivered a material improvement in productivity, recruitment and retention. This ensures that we are able to provide highly attractive opportunities for career agents with incomes up 17% and accelerating momentum in recruitment up 26% in the second half of the year.  We have the world's most professional agency that has been number one MDRT globally for the last nine years. We are also individually the number one in Mainland China, Hong Kong, ASEAN and India. And we have grown MDRT qualifiers by a further 20% in 2023. Proving the success of our high quality model.  Strategic Partnerships expand our distribution rich by bringing complimentary access to large customer pools across our markets. Overall performance in 2023 was excellent, with VONB growing by 58%. Bancassurance was up 42%. Powered by ASEAN, where we’ve flow standing relationships with leading banks, including Bangkok Bank in Thailand, Citibank in Singapore and Public Bank in Malaysia.  We reported equally impressive results from AIA's other growth engines. Our IFA and broker channel more than double VONB in 2023. We regain the number one market position in Hong Kong, achieved excellent growth in Singapore and held the largest share of wallet across our partners in India. Combined with professional advice from our unrivaled distribution, our compelling propositions are difficult to replicate.  Powered by our technology, digital and analytics capabilities, AIA's integrated product ecosystems offer greater relevance in meeting each of our customers evolving needs. We motivate and reward customers for taking actions that positively improve their physical and financial health, help them seek the best treatment and encourage them to save more effectively to meet their evolving needs.  In 2023, we broaden our customer propositions with targeted solutions, including dedicated loyalty programs in Hong Kong and Singapore, tax deductible private pensions in Mainland China, and comprehensive health and wellness solutions in ASEAN and India. AIA vitality is at the core of our ecosystem, helping our customers improve their wellbeing while delivering greater engagement and shared value generation.  Our holistic approach has resulted in us acquiring more than 1.5 million new customers in 2023, up 10% on last year. AIA's customers are increasingly loyal, with very strong growth in repeat sales, and very high persistency. Our performance in 2023 could not have been delivered without the significant investments we have made in technology, digital and analytics.  When I joined AIA in 2020, I said that a step change in how we use TDA was at the heart of our new strategy. And we set out ambitious transformation goals to enhance every aspect of our business. Since then, we have invested around $800 million in TDA, to secure our future success. We have met or exceeded most of our transformation targets, achieving our goal of being a simpler, faster, more connected organization, and a world leader in the use of TDA.  Today, 90% of our technology infrastructure is hosted in the cloud. And our end-to-end STP rate has more than doubled to 85% of all buy service and claims journeys. Cost per transaction has reduced by 32% and we have already achieved recurring expense and claims efficiencies of more than $150 million per year. Our strategy is not just aimed at transforming back office capabilities, but enables a leading customer experience. With 85% of all customer transactions completed within a single day, and highly rated digital apps, AIA ranks first by NPS in seven of our markets.  100% Digital enablement has delivered significant improvements in productivity across our unrivaled distribution platform. With our TDA transformation complete, we have the essential foundation to deploy generative AI across our business at scale. Today, we have shared on our website a separate TDA presentation. This takes you through our journey so far, and our future plans to expand distribution reach and productivity continuously enhance customer experience and grow shareholder value.  In summary, today's strong results executed across multiple growth engines and combined with our unmatched financial flexibility underscores my confidence that AIA is exceptionally well placed for profitable growth.  Now over to Garth.\nGarth Jones : Thanks, Siong. And good morning everyone. I will now take you through the financial results in more detail across growth, earnings, and capital and dividends. An excellent VONB performance for the group was driven by significant increases in each of our five largest markets and double digit growth in 10 of our markets. Amongst these Yuan Siong is already covered our very strong results in Hong Kong and Mainland China.  Breaking out our key ASEAN businesses, AIA Thailand delivered another impressive performance, up 21%, reflecting very strong growth from both our market leading agency and partnership channels. AIA Singapore grew by 10%, with growth from our core agency and an excellent performance in our partnership channel.  While AIA Malaysia delivered another good year building on its excellent growth in 2022, with VONB exceeding $300 million. Excluding Vietnam, VONB from other markets increased by 15%, with the majority of the growth coming from India. AIA's unique portfolio of businesses, diverse products and high quality distribution enable us to deploy capital in high quality, profitable new business that drives long term shareholder value creation.  You've heard me say many times before that we focus on growing total VONB rather than volume on margin alone, given the strong IRRs we achieve above 20% and short payback periods. While reporting margins may vary, if the return on capital of businesses is attractive, we will look to write it and in this way we optimize total value creation for shareholders. Our priority is growing the total dollar value of VONB and in 2023 VONB increased by $1 billion. Hong Kong and Mainland China saw a very strong demand for profitable long term savings products, which drove VONB growth and a modestly lower VONB margin for the group over the year.  In the second half, a more favorable product mix gave rise to an increase in the group's VONB margin to 54.5%. Overall, our product mix remains well balanced between traditional protection and long term savings products. The equivalent new business PVNBP margin was strong and stable at 10%. Reflecting the quality and long term nature of our business. Each of our reportable segments saw a sequential increase in margin in the second half. For the mixture of an increased margin in Hong Kong and Mainland China. And AIA China's premier agency continued to generate industry leading productivity product mix and profitability with a margin over 60%.  Across the rest of the group, a more favorable product mix cause VONB margins to increase in ASEAN. Our ability to meet the full range of customer needs across protection, high quality long term savings and retirement products is a key differentiator for AIA and a major factor in our confidence in the group's ability to deliver future VONB growth. We actively assess channel product and financial dynamics and seek to improve these further while deploying capital in a disciplined way to create optimal value for shareholders over the long term. This approach has not changed since IPO.  EV operating profit was up 33% to $8.9 billion, driven by VONB growth and an increase in the expected return reflecting higher interest rates and risk discount rates. As a result, operating return on EV stepped up to 12.9%, an increase of 350 basis points. Our focus on delivering sustainable VONB growth is a key driver of higher embedded value and increasing operating ROEV.  Within EV operating profit operating variances once again were a small positive. In line with global trends, we've seen an increase in medical claims post the pandemic. The overall prudence within our equity assumptions has absorb this negative experience, which we expect to be temporary as we reprice our annually renewable health products.  To provide in context, our consistently favorable operating variances have added $3.9 billion to EV Equity since IPO. Non-operating movements mainly related to changes in the value of Chinese and Thai equities, as well as interest rate movements over the year. Net of these, EV Equity increased to $76.1 billion before shareholder returns an increase of 7%. After returning $5.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and the ongoing share buyback program, EV Equity was $70.2 billion at the end of 2023. Our EV methodology uses spot market yields and trends overtime to our long term assumptions, which aims to smooth out short term market volatility.  At year end, we updated our long term investment return assumptions with a reduction in Mainland China and increases across the rest of the group. Whilst in aggregate these changes have a positive effect on future distributable cash flows, reflecting higher interest rates, they were offset by corresponding changes in risk discount rates. As a reminder, we have a substantial allowance for risk in our discount rates, with a risk premium of close to 5% for the group, consistent with the levels used since IPO. The net impact of changes to our economic assumptions with less than 1% of EV Equity. Our EV remains highly resilient to short term market volatility for both interest rate and equity market movements.  Now moving to IFRS earnings. CSM growth is a key driver of future OPAT. In 2023, CSM grew by 17% to $58.4 billion before released into profit. The key growth drivers were the $7 billion from new business added in the year and $2.6 billion from the expected return on enforced business. Variances and others of negative $1 billion mainly related to capital market movements.  The CSM release rate remained stable at 9.5% as $5.3 billion was released into OPAT, up 6% on last year. Net of release, underlying growth in CSM was strong at 8.4%. Growing the new business CSM faster than the CSM release rate will drive higher CSM releases and accelerate OPAT growth. OPAT per share grew by 7% on an underlying basis, and our operating margin remains strong at 16.4%  While CSM release was higher, we have seen increased medical claims since the end of the pandemic in line with global trends. You can see that OPAT was affected by $221 million of medical claims variances compared with last year. Our health insurance portfolio is comprised of annual renewable policies, and in response, we are increasing premium rates as policies renew.  Adjusting for these temporary variances and minor IFRS model refinements, OPAT increased by 7% per share. AIA's sources of earnings are high quality, with 70% from insurance services. Regular premiums make up 99% of our total way to premium income, providing very strong future cash flows and ample liquidity on our large enforce book.  Taken together with our geographically diverse portfolio of businesses bounced across the growth engines of Hong Kong, Mainland China and ASEAN. This underpins the resilience of the group's earnings and balance sheet. Our discipline strategy of focusing on value and quality has helped deliver consistent growth in OPAT per share, with a CAGR of 10% since IPO.  Shareholders allocated equity provides a clearer reflection of the underlying drivers of the change in equity. By excluding the mark to market movements on assets and liabilities relating to non-participating business, which are contained within other comprehensive income. As a reminder under IFRS 17, virtually all mark to market movements from participating business flow to insurance contract liabilities and the CSM.  Before returns to shareholders allocated equity increased to $50.7 billion, driven by a net profit of $3.8 billion. The combination of strong OPAT of $6.2 billion and the ongoing share buyback helped drive operating ROE up by 50 basis points to 13.5%. Comparing IFRS new business CSM and comprehensive equity to VONB and EV Equity clearly demonstrates the prudence of AIA's embedded value reporting. We believe that EV and VONB are more representative of shareholder value, as they are based on distributable cash flows after tax, not accounting earnings. Importantly, all expenses as well as regulatory and group capital requirements and all taxes are fully captured within our EV and VONB. With significant allowance for risk premiums in our risk discount rates. Our EV Equity does not reflect an additional $0. 9 billion if we mark to market our medium term notes. In addition, our investment in China post life is included in EV Equity at IFRS net asset value, which is around $1.5 billion lower then China post life's own embedded value.  Finally, capital and dividends. The LCSM coverage ratio is the group's principal regulatory solvency measure, taking a fully consolidated view of local business requirements and is calculated on a prescribed capital requirement basis. While the LCS M is consistent with the capital requirements used to assess regulatory solvency, free surplus continues to be more representative of the capital position for shareholders. The LCSM coverage ratio increased 14 percentage points before shareholder returns, supported by strong capital generation from our enforce business. After returns to shareholders, a solvency position remained very strong, with a coverage ratio of 275% at the end of 2023.  For comparability, we've shown a shareholder view excluding participating business. On this basis, the coverage ratio was higher, with 335%. The sensitivity of our LCSM coverage ratio to mark to market movements on equities and interest rates is small, reflecting the strength of our balance sheet and our robust risk management. Our high quality investment portfolio is constructed to match our insurance liabilities as closely as possible. As a result, 80% of non-par and surplus assets are fixed income, with the vast majority either government and government agency bonds or investment grade corporate bonds. Within this the $30 billion corporate bond portfolio is well diversified across sectors and geographies with more than 1700 issuers. The average credit rating of our corporate bond portfolio is at A minus and our expected credit loss provision at the end of the year was 0. 5% of the portfolio.  In Mainland China, the group's total exposure to real estate bonds and equities and local government financing vehicles is small. And almost all of AIA China's fixed income assets are government and government agency bonds.  In summary, we have strong asset liability management and a high quality diversified investment portfolio. The group's financial position remained very strong, with free surplus increasing by 25% to $22.3 billion, before returns to shareholders. The increase was driven by underlying free surplus generation of $6 billion and reinvestment of $1.3 billion in new business at attractive long term returns. After $5.9 billion returned to shareholders, free surplus close the year at a very strong $16.3 billion.  The Board has recommended an increase of 5% in the final dividend bringing the total dividend for the year to 161.36 Hong Kong cents per share up 5%. The Board continues to follow AIA's established prudent sustainable and progressive dividend policy allowing for future growth opportunities and the financial flexibility of the group. In addition to regular dividends, our ongoing $10 billion buyback program returned 3.6 billion to shareholders over the year. A total of $24.8 billion has now been returned to shareholders since IPO. AIA follows a clearly defined and robust capital management framework. That is the foundation for superior shareholder value generation.  Over the last two years through our disciplined approach, we've deployed $14.8 billion into business growth and significant capital returns to shareholders. We invested $2.6 billion in organic new business at highly attractive returns, generating $9.7 billion of additional shareholder value, which will come through as free surplus generation over time. Our prudent sustainable and progressive dividend policy has returned $4.6 billion to shareholders. We deployed $0.4 billion into acquisitions.  By the end of 2023, the buyback had returned $7.2 billion in excess capital to shareholders, enhancing per share financial metrics and supporting higher ROE. The program is ongoing with $2.8 billion remaining. Our free surplus position while remaining very strong, has reduced to $16.3 billion, mainly driven by the return of excess capital through the share buyback. We believe that our strong balance sheet financial flexibility, highly attractive new business growth and strong cash returns to shareholders set us apart from our competitors.  In conclusion, the group has delivered a strong financial performance in 2023 across growth, earnings and capital and dividends. VONB grew by 33% to over $4 billion. This drove EV operating profit up 33% and operating ROEV increased to 12.9%. On an underlying basis, OPAT per share grew by 7% and CSM increased by 8.4%. Free surplus increased 25% before shareholder returns. Total dividend per share was up 5% and we’ve returned a total of $5.9 billion to shareholders in 2023. Our $10 billion buyback program is ongoing, enhancing shareholder returns and we remain disciplined in our future capital deployment. AIA's robust balance sheet is a key competitive advantage, ensuring we retain our unmatched financial flexibility to invest in the enormous potential for profitable new business growth in the region, fully harnessing the exceptional qualities of AIA.  I’ll now hand back to Yuan Siong. \nLee Yuan Siong : Thanks, Garth. Let me now remind you why AIA is exceptionally well placed to deliver profitable growth well into the future. First of all, we are 100% focused on Asia, which is the most attractive market for life and health insurance in the world. Asian consumers continue to amass high levels of private savings at a rate faster than anywhere else globally. Populations are growing yet aging and with significantly low levels of insurance penetration and limited welfare coverage, there is an urgent need for the personalized products and high quality advice that only AI provides. The potential for our business is immense and our strategy is aligned to these long term structural trends.  I will now take you through how we are capturing the opportunity across our multiple growth engines, starting with Mainland China. The core of AIA China is our full time professional premier agency that is the clear market leader in Mainland China. AIA's agents are even more productive than their pre pandemic peak and outpace the industry with VONB per agent more than double that of peers.  Our success is driven by young, dynamic and entrepreneurial agency leaders who ensure sustainable growth by attracting, developing and retaining the best agents. Universal adoption of our advanced digital platforms drives higher productivity and efficiency while ensuring our strict quality standards are maintained. 93% of AIA's new agents are college graduates or above, and we saw accelerating recruitment momentum in the second half, with new recruits up 16%.  In contrast to many competitors, our agency is growing and becoming more productive, resulting in VONB growth above 20% from February to December. Our premiere agents are equipped with the skills, tools and products to successfully target the sophisticated needs of Mainland China's growing middle class consumers. Where demand for AIA's insurance propositions remains robust. More than 80% of ANP comes from this segment. And each customer holds on average six AI policies, helping them achieve their protection and long term savings goals.  We saw excellent growth in new customers in the second half of the year, providing us with significant additional opportunities as our agents grow these relationships over time. Our overall product mix is high quality, well balanced and profitable. VONB margin increase substantially in the second half to 63.4%, following a favorable shift in product mix and repricing. In 2023, over 95% of our agents sold protection products, which accounted for more than 80% of all policies from new customers. The majority of our long term savings products that were bought by existing customers who already own AIA protection policies.  It is AIA's differentiated premier agency, meeting the evolving demands of China's middle class consumers that sets us apart in this market. And we have significant headroom to grow as we build on our track record of sustained value creation across both our established and new operations. With the pandemic behind us, we have ambitious plans to accelerate growth from our new operations. As you will recall, by deepening our presence in existing geographies and entering new provinces, we significantly enlarge our addressable market.  In 2023, we opened a new provincial branch in Zhengzhou, Henan, and our Shijiazhuang Sales and Service Center in Hebei, was also upgraded to provincial status, allowing us to expand more rapidly. AIA China has also been granted regulatory approvals to enter new major cities in Hubei, and Sichuan provinces. Since 2019, our footprint has doubled to 10 geographies, adding more than 100 million potential new customers to AIA China. And our expansion model is working well. In 2023, agency VONB from our new branches grew by 55% and exceeded 5% of AIA China's agency VONB in the second half.  Notably, VONB margin is at a similar level to our establish operations as we replicate our proven strategy of targeting the middle class with highly relevant long term savings and protection propositions. Recruitment for our newest branches, is also very strong and accelerating, with more than 77% growth compared to the previous year. As we continue to execute our plans, the vast majority of Mainland China's growing middle class population will be within our reach. I have no doubt in our ability to expand that scale, whilst maintaining strict quality standards and our leading customer experience. We are also able to extend AIA China's customer reach through highly selective partnerships with banks that have aligned long-term ambitions and create value for both partners.  While our partners are some of the largest players in the market, we are focused on meeting the holistic protection and long term savings needs of only their most affluent customers. Through our exclusive partnership with BEA and our strategic relationships with Bank of China and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, our average case size exceeds $20,000 U.S. dollars, higher than our average MCV case size in Hong Kong.  Bancassurance is a small part of AIA China's total VONB and we have seen steadily improving new business profitability that is complementary to our core strategy. AIA China is singularly positioned for growth in this dynamic market. We have the unique combination of profitable products addressing the needs of a targeted growing and affluent customer segment and a world class distribution with significant headroom for growth as we advanced our geographical expansion plans.  Next, moving to Hong Kong. AIA Hong Kong was the largest individual contributor to the group's VONB with 82% growth. Our premier agency is the leader across Hong Kong and Macau and agency VONB was up 57%. We are growing capacity and quality with 59% growth in new recruits and more than 40% growth in MDRT qualifiers. Our bank partnerships provide exclusive access to over 2 million customers while leading IFA proposition has seen us return to number one in this channel. AIA Hong Kong's products and services have broad appeal to both domestic as well as MCV customers. We have the number one Net Promoter Score. The launch of the AIA Wealth Management Center in March, provides an ecosystem of integrated health and wealth management services. And we are accelerating our health capabilities through more active medical network management, leveraging amplify health, powerful data and analytics. As a result of our success, I'm very proud that we were the overall market leader by new business in 2023.  Now taking a closer look at the strong return of MCV business in 2023. I'm confident that the demand is sustainable. More than 70% of VONB comes from customers new to AIA and around 60% of policies were bought by customers who reside outside the Greater Bay area. Our agency generated two thirds of MCV business. And we saw growth in both VONB and the number of new policies in the second half. Following an initial search of larger policies after the border reopen, average case size has stabilized in the second half. As you know, we successfully retained the scale of our MCV focus agency through the pandemic. And we have progressively stepped up recruitment supporting very strong momentum in this growing customer segment.  Now turning to our largest growth engine, AIA's ASEAN markets. We are the leading life and health insurer across the region. The combination of our powerful proprietary distribution channels and high quality product mix allows us to deliver superior growth and profitability. VONB in 2023 was 20% above pre pandemic peak levels.  We are the largest and most professional agency in the region, and our long term strategic partnerships with leading banks are key asset for the group. Our propositions are focused on long term protection and unit link products, which in turn drove strong VONB margin of around 70% in 2023, making this a highly profitable growth engine for the group. Our position and performances across ASEAN are solid and consistent.  Let me take you through the three reportable segments, starting with our largest business, Thailand. We are the undisputed leader and have an excellent track record of consistent execution with VONB 60% higher than pre pandemic peak levels. With a 41% market share, our agency is the largest and most professional in Thailand by far. We continue to uplift quality and standards every year, and our highly productive financial advisor program increase headcount by 28% in 2023.  In bancassurance, productivity was up 31%. And we are working closely with Bangkok bank to unlock the significant headroom for growth from its large retail customer base. As a growing market, there is immense potential for AIA in Thailand. Our focus on traditional protection and unit link products ensures our market dominance and differentiates the quality of our growth. In Singapore, we have outperformed the market through our focus on protection regular premium business. Our agency is the most professional, most productive and largest tide distribution force in the market. A quarter of our agents are MDRT. And we rank the clear number one in Singapore.  We are continuing to scale the agency with expansion of both our agency leaders and onboarding new recruits. In the partnership channel, we have strong momentum through Citibank selected high net worth brokers, and we lead the market in employee benefits business. We offer differentiated health and wellness solutions, leveraging AIA's leading regional funds platform and our market leadership in health insurance. We see strong potential for growth from AIA's Singapore, as we can tap into growing domestic demand, as well as Singapore's position as a regional hub.  AIA Malaysia has grown significantly over the last four years, and 2023 was another strong year, with VONB exceeding $300 million. Targeted investments in technology, digital and analytics have enabled us to simultaneously increase manpower and productivity across our leading premier agency, an exclusive partnership with public bank.  Our strong focus on protection, both traditional and unit link delivers a high quality profitable product mix. We are the market leader in health insurance and AIA vitality has been a key differentiator with a very strong pickup by both agents and our customers. I am very proud of our success in Malaysia. And I'm confident that we can extend our track record for many years to come.  Finally, India, where our joint venture, Tata AIA Life provides us with an exceptional platform to capture the tremendous opportunity for life and health insurance. By 2030, the middle class population will reach 1 billion and protection coverage remains very low. Tata AIA Life continue is strong track record, with VONB up by more than 30% in 2023. Driven by an excellent performance in Premier agency, and strong growth in our partnership channel. In eight years, we have advanced from number 17 in the market, to the number three private life insurer in 2023. We are the market leader in retail protection, and we have a balance multi-channel distribution platform.  Our differentiated agencies strategy has made us the number one MDRT life insurer and our focus on growing and enhancing our agency has delivered consistent growth and outperformance against the industry. Our key priority is to build the most professional distribution force at scale that is on par with AIA’s leading premier agencies. Our protection focused strategy, quality distribution, and proven execution ensure that Tata AIA Life is well on its way to capturing India's massive potential.  To summarize, we have multiple growth engines to leverage the enormous opportunities for life and health insurance across Asia. We target a resilient middle class and affluent customer base, through our market leading proprietary distribution, and superior strategic execution, combined with AIA’s unmatched financial flexibility, we are in a unique position, I'm certain, that we can capture the full economics of growth in the region.  In closing, 2023 was a strong year for the group. VONB was up 33%, to more than $4 billion and we achieved growth in all key metrics. We also returned $5.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and the ongoing share by that program. It is AIA’s capacity to deliver growth, earnings and cash that sets us apart from our competitors. I have every confidence that AIA will extend his strong track record of creating value for all our shareholders well into the future. Thank you.\nLance Burbidge : Good morning from AIA Central in Hong Kong. We will now move to the Q&A session, which is by Zoom webinar. If you want to ask a question [technical difficulty]. Together with me today are Lee Yuan Siong, our Group CEO and President; and Garth Jones, our Group CFO. We also have our Regional Chief Executives and other members of the Group Executive Committee with us in the room.  Before we start our Q&A, let me remind you that we've also shared on our website, a separate TDA video presentation this morning. And I hope you have a chance to watch it later if you haven't already watched it. With that operator, over to you for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Let's proceed and our first question comes from Charles Zhou of UBS Securities. Charles, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nCharles Zhou : Okay, thanks. Thanks for giving me this opportunity to ask the question. So I have a three question. First, as you know, there are lots of concern about the China macro slowdown, but I think we're glad to see AIA delivered 20% value of new business growth last year. And also my understanding is that for Hong Kong MCV business we see first, -- sorry, Q4 versus Q3 still see sequential improvement for the MCV value from new business.  My question is, so can you maybe share with us about the outlook for this year for 2024? Or maybe just give us more colors or maybe even some numbers about what about the momentum provider of new business in Mainland China year-to-date, and also for the Hong Kong business, particularly for the MCV year-to-date? My second question, we know that in China, we see a prolonged interest rate down cycle, and also increasingly complex investment environment.  So how does AIA cope with such challenges from the asset and liability perspective? And can you maybe discuss about this separately? And third, you know, we know AIA has purchased I think shares almost up to $8 billion U.S. dollar or 80% of your $10 billion buyback program. And we estimate the current buyback program will be completed in November based on the current purchasing pace.  So in the future, we understand that IRR for new business is over 20%. But what will the company do to improve the capital efficiency and also enhance the shareholders return? Maybe talk about a for maybe any future buyback or dividend increase? Thanks. \nLee Yuan Siong: Thank you, Charles. First, I think we talked about Hong Kong, our Hong Kong business grew very strongly. VONB was up by 82% in 2023. Growth came from both MCV and domestic Hong Kong market, I am confident that the demand from MCV business is sustainable and in fact, we see we saw very strong VONB growth momentum in the first two months of the year. And I'm also confident that there is a significant need for long term protection and savings from both domestic and MCV customer segments. Jacky, you like to supplement?\nJacky Chan: Yes. Thank you, Yuan Siong. Yes, I'm also very happy to talk about Hong Kong, Hong Kong really demonstrate very strong underlying growth drivers. So for our core agency channel, you can see that the underlying driver in terms of recruitment grow strongly by a 59%. And in fact, the quarterly recruitment in the second half of the year already exceed the pre pandemic level.  And we also see that on the MCV side, which you also talked about, the MCV active agent in the second half grew by 23%, compared to the first half. And our overall, both domestic plus MCV together are all for productivity of our agent by ANP per active agent. Actually strongly beyond the pre pandemic level already. So we have a very, very strong agency force. And we already talked about the MDRT qualifiers, intervention fee is already grown by more than 40%. So this sets a very strong fundamental in the agency business in Hong Kong going forward.  And at the same time, you also see that AIA Hong Kong achieved number one in the IFA broker channel for the whole industry in Hong Kong. And the IFA brokers come to partner with Hong Kong because we have a strong brand, we have a strong product proposition, and we have strong servicing to help them service those more affluent customer segments. So, as a result. I want to let you know that as you asked about the year-to-date, the year-to-date momentum in the first two months is very, very strong.\nLee Yuan Siong: On China, very strong growth from since the pandemic reopening from February to December last year, we grew by 28%. And we saw the momentum continue into the first two months of this year with strong double digit growth. We have a very resilient model and very differentiated model in Mainland China, that's able to grow through economic cycles. We are in a very unique position in that we can expand into new provinces our geographical footprint over the last five years’ double.  We are in 10 geographies now and we continue to plan for future new provincial branches are one to two a year. So I think we are in a very, very unique position and we are very confident of the growth prospects. In China we are servicing mainly -- we are servicing our target customer segment the middle class and affluent customers who are more resilient and through different economic cycles we have a very professional premiere agency channel that is -- and we were able to maintain our agency force, in fact we've seen growth in our agency force as compared to the market, the productivity of our premier agency force is more than two times stead of the industry average. Now, Jacky?\nJacky Chan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. Let me describe a little bit more about how differentiated A channel in China, Both, the agency channel and the partnership channel are really differentiated, as to our core distribution channel in China, which is our premier agency aligned the market situation, we are able to grow the overall agency manpower, driven by strong recruitment momentum, as you have seen in our second half new agent grow year by year by 16%. And our active agent also grow in the last year, and also driven by a strong, very, very strong increase in the agency productivity.  In fact, I also want to share with you that our experienced agent productivity in the second half of last year, already grown beyond the pre pandemic level, and our new agent income in last year actually grow strongly also beyond the pre pandemic level. This shows how strong the underlying drivers of our premier agencies are. And in fact, our agency force target the middle class and above customer segment. And in last year 2023, the middle class and above customer segment contribute more than 80% of the ANP.  And in our almost 30 years’ experience in Mainland China, we note that this kind of a middle class and above customer segment in AIA over time, they purchased over on average six policy from AIA China. So that's that demonstrate how strong our differential agency in China are and they are able to capture the growing opportunity in Mainland China. As to the bancassurance, we also employ a very differentiated strategy.  We selectively partner with those bank partners who are really willing to work with us. Targeting their effort and above customer segment, has user already talked about our exclusive partnership with BEA and our strategic partnerships with Bank of China and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank on selected at point of sales, which targeting the affluent and above customer segment, we saw the average ticket size is above U.S. dollar $20,000.  And we are not doing this like a transactional business like the rest. We are nurturing helping the bank to nurture and engage the customer over time, so that we can give them a comprehensive suite of both protection and long term saving product. So as a result, these two channels really differentiate and coupled up with we have tremendous opportunity to expand in Mainland China. We are now across our geography from five provincial license to 10. And there are more to come and we are also growing strongly in our new footprint in Mainland China. So we are very, very positive, the AIA China is well positioned to capture the enormous opportunity in Mainland China.\nLee Yuan Siong: I hand over to Garth, to talk about the low interest environment in China and about capital.\nGarth Jones : Yes. Thanks, Yuan Siong and Jacky. As you know, Charles we adopt a basis of matching assets and liabilities as closely as we can and that starts with the liabilities. So as you know, we focus on selling protection and long term savings products, which have long term surrender penalties, low underlying guaranteed rates and as economic situations move, we will then reprice and adjust our pricing in our bases as we go along.  On the asset side, as you say it is complex in China, but we look to try and make it as simple as possible. We've shown before that the vast majority of our assets are in fixed income, more than 90% of that is in long government bonds. And if you look at the duration of those bonds, more than half are above 30 years. So again, that goes to the basis of matching assets and liabilities as closely as possible. And that then you see come through in our earnings and you know over 90% of the earnings are insurance service based. So that's China.  On capital. As we tried to show in Slide 31. We are disciplined stewards of the shareholders capital. We've deployed close to $15 billion over the last two years. We've maintained a strong balance sheet, our LCSM solvency have tune in 75%. And we have an ability to stand -- withstand market stress. That strength also gives us financial flexibility, it gives us financial flexibility to continue to invest in new business. As you know our ROE is above 20% and the payback is short.  We've invested $2.6 billion in new business trend, and that's generated $9.7 billion of new business value. We have a prudent progressive sustainable dividend policy. $4.6 billion returned in the last two years as well as the buyback. And as you correctly know, we're in year three of a three-year buyback program a $10 billion share buyback program. So, we will look at ways in which we continue to manage the balance sheet be this disciplined stewards of the shareholder capital. We have a number of levers to do that, but the best lever that we have is to grow our business, grow the business organically. We look to increase AER, we also to optimize that.\nLance Burbidge : Okay, thanks. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from MW Kim from JP Morgan. MW, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nMW Kim : Thank you for the opportunity. I have three questions. So the first one is about the India. For Tata, AIA 37% value of a new business growth looks impressive, and company achieved the top three position among private life insurers in terms of the new life sales volume. I guess that now the scale looks sizable even compared to the AIA Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. So, I want to know when we would see the separate VONB or the EV disclosure of the India operation. And also the management view on any challenges or the issue relate to the ownership increase on Tata AIA it's appreciated.  The second one is about the claim. Just want to ask that whether the claim experience our role would remain the more favorable after the repricing or the premium hike. Just wondering because it sounds like the overall their claim pressure looks actually the happening across the Asia, so to get more insight on that one. And the last one is, the company has designated as an International Active Insurance Group by IAIS recently on top of GWS designation by IA. So under this designation is there anything the mind pool in terms of the future use of excess capital? Thank you.\nLee Yuan Siong: Thank you, MW. We are very happy with our performance in India, India is an exciting market for EIA, and we had an outstanding partner in Tata Sons, I think the best partner you can ever find in India. As you mentioned, we are very proud of the fact that we were able to climb from number 17 to number three, largest private life insurer in India over the last eight years. So, in terms of the when we will disclose more information about Tata AIA, I handover to Garth?\nGarth Jones : Yes. Thanks MK, MW, as you know, I also have sort of management responsibility for India. So I have a vested interest in this. I want the business to grow to a size where it's big enough to break out. I think, a couple of things to remember. Number one is that we have 49% and it's a joint venture. So we're only putting 49% through, we're not putting 100% through and then taking the minority interest out below the line.  It continues to grow. And as it continues to grow, we'll look to, we put more information in the pack. We'll look to give you more disclosures. And I know that there's a lot of disclosures locally as well. It was the largest contributor to the growth in other markets. And but clearly it's a relatively new company as Yuan Siong said, it's grown from 17 to three in the last eight years. So the enforce book isn't quite as representative as the new business.\nLee Yuan Siong: In terms of claims, as you know, we are the largest Pan Asian health insurance insurer. And we see in line with global trends, we seen an increase in the medical claims post pandemic. See, three reasons, one is people who have put off non-urgent medical screening and treatments during the pandemic coming back. Secondly, an increase in preventative checkups, following higher awareness, post COVID. And three, spike in seasonal illnesses from causes like respiratory viruses that were suppressed during the pandemic. We expect these impacts on profitability to be temporary. And we are taking a number of actions to support sustainable medical costs management solutions. Maybe, Kevin, you want to talk about it?\nKevin Loh: Thanks so much. This is Dr. Kevin Loh, Group Chief Healthcare Officer. Maybe give a little bit more color to what Yuan Siong said. So post pandemic years indeed, the healthcare demand has returned to its expected trajectory after being suppressed in 2020 to 2022. And as Yuan Siong say, there is some additional temporary increases in demand. But medical inflation has always been there, we have always been able to deal with it. Our medical portfolio is essentially yearly renewable bases. And though there were repricing constraints during the pandemic years, we are now ready to put through the repricing to catch up.  Now in addition, we have launched our integrated health strategy, where we will steer customers into more seamless cost effective health care networks. We will reduce unnecessary costs and claims while maintaining excellent clinical outcomes. And all this will help us ensure health products remain attractive going forward and make our business sustainable. So we are continuing to ride the growth and health care.\nLee Yuan Siong: Yes, Garth. \nGarth Jones : On the AAIG point. As you know AIG was subjected to group wide supervision by the Hong Kong AIA, and they have a group supervisory framework that is in place robust framework. A key element of that is the LCSM solvency ratio, or the solvency coverage that you see on Slide 27. And the 275% is clearly demonstrably strong. I think the key thing to note is that the sensitivities on the right, you can see that the sensitivities are relatively small.  The other thing I would note with the GWS framework is that it includes a second pillar, which is an economic capital assessment that we provide to the IA. And clearly, the LCSM coverage ratio is as it is, we haven't had to adjust anything for that. The third thing to note, I think is that the free surplus still remains the basis that we would ask people to look at that we think is more representative of shareholders, resources and so on. Whereas the LCSM coverage ratio is clearly designed around the strength of the balance sheet from a policyholder protection perspective.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kailash Mistry of HSBC. Kailash, please press the unmute button on your screen and answer your question.\nKailesh Mistry : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. I've got three questions. First one is on China EV assumptions. Just wanted to understand why you've decided to lower the risk premium now, particularly as some would argue that this is in inconsistent with the general uncertainty and lack of confidence in the market overall?  The second question is on Slide 38. Thank you very much for the additional detail. Effectively just wanted to understand on the left hand side of that slide. How long does it take for customers to you know get to six policies per customer? And secondly, on that slide, how many customers do you have in in Mainland China just to try and scale that? And the last question is a little bit more clarity just around medical claims, et cetera, is the main message here that the 400 million charge on CSM and EV is essentially the assumption change that you’ve? And then the operating variances through the OPAT is essentially the adverse experience this year. And since the entire portfolio re prices from 2024 you know that we should get a clean set of numbers on the medical side. Thank you. \nLee Yuan Siong: Okay. Thank you I think we take the second question first about China. I think I am very happy to see very strong 21% growth in new customer saw in China. And as you can see, we are very much focused on the middle class and affluent customer segment and who will have a long term relationship with the company and throughout the different life stages, they will be buying more and more products from AIA.  And as I mentioned earlier, our model whereby we are servicing these more resilient and more affluent customers who are more resilient through different economic cycles in terms of their spending on insurance and on savings, I think insurance that we are able to grow through different economic cycles. As I mentioned, just now, we've seen a very strong return to growth in 2023. And this is carried forward into 2024 in the first two months of this year.  Now, in terms of the six policies per customer, I think I hand over to Jacky. \nJacky Chan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. In fact, you will see that we grow new customer strong double digit value last year, and the total individual customer AIA China is actually approaching 4 million, and it is still growing quite strongly. And in terms of the six policy per customer, as I said, it is our enforce data. So, AIA has been returned to our home in Mainland China in 1992. So, by now, it's about 32 years, and you know, the trajectory of those our business starting small and then we grow strongly expensively, we grow very strongly after the IPO of AIA Group in 2010.  So, this six policy can for middle class and above customer is an enforced as of now. So, you may imagine that is roughly I would say, or roughly 10 years now, because of the scale of more customer in the later part of this 32 years, compared to the first half of the 32 years. So this gives you a sense that it is really, really a lucrative customer segment that we are able to target on because they will keep buying policy.  And you can see that we also picked up in this on this lag over time, they bought two CI and 2.5 medical and accidental 1.5 long term save and you know that long term savings just started to become more attractive, the customer, especially the middle class, and above customer now become more attracted to long term saving plans. So you can see there are really a lot of potential to continue to grow beyond just six policy per customer for middle class and above. \nLee Yuan Siong: And, so just add. This is a -- as we show this for China, this is not unique to AI China, you know, is our very differentiated highly professional premier agency model whereby our agents will service their customers for very long periods of time, throughout the different life stages. And in Hong Kong in other markets. We also see, and we are also encouraged by the fact that in 2023, we add on more than 1.5 million customers in our major markets. And now the question is on China EVs functions and the questions about the medical claims, I think I hand over to Garth. \nGarth Jones : Yes, thanks Yuan Siong. I think with the assumptions, firstly, to say the first thing to remember always is that we manage the business for the long term, and our AV methodology and our assumptions reflect that. That was assumption based on a wide range of reference points, we have a strong process around that, that goes through our audit process. That includes looking at spot rates, forward rates, and we get a fundamental view from a third party and so on.  Looking at that and looking over the longer term, we look at both the risk free interest rates and the risk discount rates in order to measure the risk premium as you know. In China specifically, we reduce the risk free rates and we reduce the risk discount rates. The key thing to note is number one is on as we show on chart 19 that we've been prudent in our assumptions with the long term rates compared with market rates moving together, but slowly over time, and generally being conservative and prudent.  And then secondly, that there's still a substantial amount of risk premium in our risk discount rates. So in China, for example, that is now 5.7%, which is above our average, and our averages stayed about the same since its IPO. In terms of the medical claims, there's a $500 million provision for expected claims in both our IFRS and EV assumptions for the CSM, as you say, we reflect current experience through the higher premium rates and the repricing that we're going through the medical experience that we showed of $221 million actually flows through in a couple of areas, it flows through operating variances, and also in what's called risk adjustments release another. That's where the corporate solutions businesses, for example. And we've given an indication of the impact of that.  I think that $221 million has to be also viewed in the context of a premium volume from that business of around $5 billion. So a relatively small percentage. We're obviously taking proactive management actions will reprice our products, but also, as Kevin has said, well, we are looking at what we are doing with our integrated health strategy to support sustainable medical cost management and thereby also reduce premium increases for our policyholders.\nOperator: Next question comes from Thomas Wang of Goldman Sachs. Thomas, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nThomas Wang : Thank you. Thanks for the opportunity. Couple question, early if I stay on page 38. Thanks for providing that VONB product mix. Can you just help us or give a little bit color in terms of what that would look like I say last year and how management think this mix will change in 2024 and going forward. And secondly, on capital, if I sort of flipped the dividend question to a leverage question what -- as you think about shareholder return? And also the LCS, what's the target leverage ratio? Or that management have in the medium to long term? Thank you.\nLee Yuan Siong: Okay. Jacky? \nJacky Chan: Yeah, thank you for the question. In fact, I think on the Slide 38. This shows that we continue to maintain a strong sales and momentum in the protection policy. It makes up roughly 40% of the VONB. And the key thing you will have to see that you said we want to let you know that our agents really continue to sell potential policy because more than 95% of our agency last year, they did sell a protection product. And in fact, in terms of new business by a number of policies, more than 80% of them protection, and among the protection will be more than 70% CI products.  I continue to uphold, how A China is so passionate in quickly units and protection product, because in last year, we continue to roll out new CI coverage with cancer cell coverage. And in fact, earlier this year, we also launched a new medical and accident potential product with a longer period of premium payments before we knew for. So this attracts a lot of attention and event I want to continue to let you know that going into the first two months in this year, we come to see very, very strong growth and momentum in our protection sales.  That said, as we already mentioned a lot, right now in the current market situation and the Mainland customers especially middle class and above customers are peppers, they really consider positively that long term saving plan from life insurance office is a good wealth management product for them. And therefore, we continue to see that there is strong demand in our long term saving product and at the same time, the government continue to promote personal pension preparation. So our flagship Personal Pension Benefit Plan continue to attract attention from the middle class and above customers in Mainland China. \nLee Yuan Siong: I just want to add that, we have always been very clear that we focus on growth in the total VONB rather than just focusing on sales volume or margin alone. And we continue to be very financially disciplined. And we will write new business if returns on capital, attractive for us short payback periods in order to drive growth, earnings and cash. So I just want to supplement than.\nGarth Jones : Yes, thanks, Yuan Siong, and thanks Thomas. Yes, as I said earlier, we're always looking at ways in which we can optimize the E using various tools. We have a strong balance sheet that provides us with financial flexibility not only for, to withstand stress, but to take advantage of all the growth opportunities that are available to us. We clearly have a strong balance sheet, our ratings reflect that. And we have a modest leverage ratio. That gives us financial flexibility and we'll continue to look at how we optimize our capital structure going forward. We'll continue to look at how we optimize E.\nOperator: Next question comes from Richard Xu, of Morgan Stanley. Richard, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nLee Yuan Siong: Can you hear us?\nRichard Xu: Yes. Can you hear me? Okay. \nLee Yuan Siong: Yes, now, okay.\nRichard Xu: Okay, thanks for the opportunity. Two question for me. One is, first of all, on the Hong Kong MCV business, it's been strong, certainly compared to the market, but overall market is some slowing down from, also what we see in China, right, in the income growth and macro environments quite divergent recoveries, I mean, there's different levels of recovery in different regions. So, from what you see 70% outside is what doing right now, and what's really driving the market share gains. And looking ahead, where do you see the MCV overall market is growing the growth rate? And then which region, what type of middle class, I guess, insurance buyers are coming to Hong Kong and supporting the growth? And secondly is for overall region and we see the other region has been somewhat weak. I mean, I see, management mentioned, Vietnam is key driver, and other any other driver for the other bucket. And when do we think the overall other regions going to see some rebound in terms of the VONB growth? Thank you. \nLee Yuan Siong: Okay. On Hong Kong MCV business, as I said just now, I believe that the demand from Hong Kong MCV business is sustainable. I think MCV Mainland Chinese customers, they come to buy our products. One, I think there's a lower risk appetite now for risky wealth management products and property investments in China. They want to access, higher quality better health care services. There's a need for currency and asset diversification. So, I think this demand remains very strong. We see that in the fourth quarter of last year there's a continued uptick in MCV business quarter-on-quarter, and we are seeing the momentum carrying forward into 2024 with strong MCV demand in the first two months of the year. Jacky? \nJacky Chan: Yes, very happy to talk about MCV, because MCV has been a part of the Hong Kong insurance business for nearly two decades. And the demand or continue to remain very strong because of many other fundamentals as Yuan Siong just mentioned. And in the case of AIA, AIA’s differentiated channel across agency bancassurance and IFA, we are really well positioned to capture these MCV opportunities.  So as you mentioned about the so called slowdown of the MCV in the market, you may observe these trends in the overall Hong Kong user market as released by the Hong Kong IA, for the whole year 2023. But in the case of Hong Kong, AIA Hong Kong, we saw growth in both ANP and VONB from MCV, going from Q3 to Q4.  And we also already mentioned about, our agents are very well prepared for the MCV and the ramp of MCV we focus that we could increase in the second half of last year, which already surpassed the quarterly average of 2019. And also, the MCV active agent has a strong double digit growth of 23% in the second half. And in fact, when you look at the MCV visitors to Hong Kong has over the last year, the overall visitor number is just roughly 50% of 2018, which was the peak of the Mainland Chinese visitor before 2019, which was a little bit impact by social event.  So you see, there is still you know, a very big room of the tourists coming from Mainland to Hong Kong. And you also saw that just recently, the Hong Kong government and the Chinese government announced that they open up two more additional cities in Mainland China to allow solo travel to come to Hong Kong, they are from Xi An and also Qingdao, and this is the first time in the last 16 years, opening up two more big cities to allow solo traveler to come across the border to visit Hong Kong. So I would say all this, really see that the strong momentum should be there. And in the case of Air Hong Kong in the first two months of this year, Yuan Siong already mentioned, we continues to see a very, very strong growth and demand on our product and services from the MCV customers.\nLee Yuan Siong: Now, Hong Kong and China, two very important strong growth engines for AIA, but we also have ASEAN and India. And in fact, ASEAN is our largest contributor to group VONB last year of 35%. And, in fact, ASEAN contributed to more than $1.5 billion of VONB. And this is actually 20% above pre pandemic levels. Right. So these are very important growth engine for AIA. We have obviously within ASEAN as we mentioned, Vietnam is going through some market wide issues which has impacted the whole market but outside of Vietnam, we're seeing they're seeing good performance from businesses from ASEAN as a whole.  India again, just now we mentioned, very strong performance 37% growth in 2023. Within ASEAN itself, we have Thailand, which is our largest business in ASEAN and we are clear market leader in Thailand for Life and Health Insurance. In fact, Thailand is standout because in 2023 VONB from Thailand is more than 60% above pre pandemic levels, with market share 41% in agency and agency is a very strong contributor, the main contributor of VONB for Thailand business. And obviously, of course, we also have Bangkok Bank and Bangkok Bank, we saw 31% increase in productivity in 2023. Within ASEAN, we also have Singapore where we outperform the market and deliver double digit new business growth in 2023. So.\nOperator: Next question is from Edwin Liu of CLSA. Edwin, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nEdwin Liu : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the opportunity to ask question. Just one quick question for me. And just to follow up on your insurance comments on Thailand. We noted that the strong performance in Thailand with record high margin, so just to want to get more color on the Thailand performance. What's the major reason to drive the margin higher, and do you believe that the margin has reached a peak or maybe normalized in the later years?  Or is this sort of a normalized level right now? And also regarding the IFA program, it seems after previous year's efforts, finally started to deliver results. And in terms of the growth for the FA numbers, should we expect the double digit growth can continue for the medium term, say, three to five years down the road? That's my question. Thanks.\nLee Yuan Siong: Thank you for asking a question on Thailand, because we are all really happy to talk about Thailand. The clear market leader number one in MDRT, as I mentioned, 41% agency market share, and very happy that the European following us and following developments with regard to the IFA program. VONB from FEs [ph] is more than double the level in 2019. And we continue to be able to see very strong growth in FE headcount and contribution from FEs to the overall VONB of the company. I hand over to HakLeh to talk about Thailand a little more.\nHakLeh Tan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. Thanks Edwin for the question. As Yuan Siong mentioned, AIA Thailand deliver excellent results in 2023, VONB was up 21% and 60% higher than the pre pandemic level. Just on our agency, we are the clear market leader with 41% market share. The success of our agency was driven by our quality recruitment program, particularly the financial advisor program, as well as our ability to continuously enhance the productivity of our agency force.  As you are correctly pointed out, the FA program has been around for a while, in fact, it's been around for more than seven years. I think over that period, we can see the program has grown from strength to strength, as of last year the FA contribute to close to 40% of the total production of agency and with an average productivity of 2.3 times of the non-IFA. So the program that will continue to drive our agency growth. And it's also worth noting that most of the new agency managers that we have over the last few years, are individuals who graduated from the FA programs, and most of them, many of them on to become agency leaders, and continue to help us to grow and promote the IFA programs by recruiting a lot more quality individuals into the program.  Just in terms of our overall product proposition, we offer a very comprehensive range of product proposition covering life CI health, as far as long term savings, and as well supported by our best in class digital platform covering the entire customer engagement journey. And we also have done the best in class digital marketing capabilities in Thailand.  We believe Thailand is a growing market with substantial protection gap, is also a country with an aging population that requires more long term savings. Demand for our product propositions and our professional advice is a strongest ever. And we have a strong local team with proven track record of execution. So we're confident that AI Thailand is very well placed to capitalize on the future potential in Thailand.\nOperator: This question is from Michelle Ma of Citi. Michelle, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nMichelle Ma : Thank you for the opportunity. This is Michelle from Citi Research. I have two questions. First is the use of free surplus. So very simple calculation here. So given the very stable $6 billion underlying free surplus generation every year. So this is enough to fund new business at around $1.3 billion and then support progressive dividend payout about $2.3 billion. And assuming no significant investment variance, so can we say the company has a capacity about $2.4 billion every year for capital management such as buyback or extra dividend payment to maintain a stable free surplus balance? This is the first question.  And second question back to China. So, really appreciate the new chart on the Page 38, about the product mix of China agency portfolio. So I think this is really informative and really helpful. So the question is, so we notice for the private pension and retirement products, so the margin is high is over 65% bigger than the margin. So just wonder, the mix within this saving products, we're still seeing continued gain in the product mix of this particular long term savings product since the beginning of the year. And what's the approximate margin for the remaining other long term savings? So yeah, just want to have a sense on this. Thank you.\nLee Yuan Siong: Yes, thank you for your question. Let me take the question on China. And as you see, we are very happy that last year, we saw a good proportion of our product mix in the private pension product, just to let you know, right now the private pension product only allows through a number, a few major cities, and the Mainland Chinese customer already announced that they will expand this product and make it available to more major cities.  So this is a very good news, especially for AI in China, because our agent, high quality agent and their target customers segment, those that need to pay meaningful income tax. So if you ask talking about you're looking forward there, I will say this private pension product will continue to be a major product on long term saving from the agency channel of AIA China.  And in terms of the margin question, in fact, margin are very healthy across all the long term saving products, and our agency channel continue to maintain a overall margin of close to 60%, which is a very healthy and strong margin. Garth, on free surplus.\nGarth Jones : Yes, thanks, Michelle. And clearly, as you say, we've generated good underlying free surplus generation, you've seen that in the last two years, we've continued to grow free surplus. You've also seen that we've deployed $14.8 billion of capital and that's reduced the free surplus overall. I think, you know, as I said earlier, we consider ourselves disciplined stewards of shareholder capital.  And obviously, one of the things is a strong balance sheet, you didn't mention an increase in the stress capital that we might need as this balance sheet grows, which would have to be obviously taken into account. But clearly, we're in year three of a three-year buyback program. We'll continue and we'll do our business planning, we look for a long term business. We'll continue to look at not only growing up as we've done again last year, but also optimizing E as we've also done last year, as we go forward.\nOperator: Next question comes from Michael Lee of Bank of America Securities. Michael, please press the unmute button on your screen and as your question.\nMichael Lee : Hi, thank you. This is Michael Lee from Bank of America Securities. So I have two questions. The first question is about Page 40. So, you mentioned that in January ‘24 this year, you saw an increase of VONB margin in bancassurance channel quite significantly to above 30%. So, any reason behind this kind of increase because usually bancassurance channel margin is quite low. So 30% is quite decent margin for bancassurance. Is that because of product mix changes, or some fee cards fee changes renegotiation with banks?  And also on this page. In the middle of this page, you mentioned that for BEA products and products via BEA and Bank of China and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank the size policy size is at 20k to 23k. And the product size in China postal savings is at about 5k U.S. dollars. So why this difference in terms of size of these policies? Is it because of the different product strategy or just the difference in client profile? So that is the first question.  The second question is about ASEAN countries, ASEAN markets. So definitely this is the focus of investors when China is weak, I mean, macro is weak. And for ASEAN countries, and you mentioned that the total contribution is 35%. And we know Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia already like top 30%, which means that the rest of the ASEAN markets should have greater potential to grow.  Do you have any detailed strategies in this market like in Indonesia, Philippines, and also Vietnam? Because Thailand is a very, very successful example here. Several years ago, you mentioned that you’re building and recruit those agents and you did a very good job in terms of volume growth and margin improvement. So I think it's important for us to understand what kind of strategies you have in those markets, which are still small but with great potentials. Thank you.\nLee Yuan Siong: Okay, thank you. On the China bancassurance, I think we have a very differentiated bancassurance model. In Mainland China, we partner with a small group of highly selective bank partners targeting the affluent and high net worth customers and it is currently -- it is still a small proportion of China's VONB is incremental to our core agency channel. In terms on the details as I hand over to Jacky.\nJacky Chan: Thank you, Yuan Siong, First of all about our bancassurance. I want to say that in fact a bancassurance are still very profitable for AIA. We see that with the more kind of operationalization of the bancassurance product and compensation to the banks. Actually, this is a very old channel for AIA to grow into, because in the past, the bancassurance has really contributed a very tiny proportion of the business. And you can see that the margin really progressively improves from first half to the second half and then to January. So, the key reason behind is that first of all, the pricing interest rate change, I believe you're also aware of that. So, for the non-product, it has to come down from 3.5% to 3%. So that really also improve the margin in the second half of last year.  And furthermore, there is a so called rationalization of fee to the bank or the compensation. So, I will call it rationalization, so that basically means that it makes it maybe more reasonable. So it becomes a win-win-win situation for the bank for the insurance company and for the customer too, more high quality product can be made available to so full pension of the customer. So due to the compensation rationalization, the margin in January, since January this year actually further improve to beyond 30%. So basically, you can see that the bancassurance channel in Mainland China is already a profitable channel.  And for AIA, we’re focusing on the F1 and above customer segment, you will see that for our exclusive partnership with BEA and strategic partnership with BOC and as PDB our average case size already exceeding $20,000 U.S. dollar, which Yuan Siong mentioned that it is if and beyond the average case size of MCV in Hong Kong. And I wonder also you know that, for the cooperation with the postal savings Bank of China, we also target their affluent segment. But of course, different bank has different level of efforts.  We're focusing on work with the wealth management center, tackling those are more affluent segments within the postal savings Bank of China. And the average case size of $5,000 U.S. is not that small. The average domestic Hong Kong average case is above $5,000 U.S. So it's just a comparison that Oh, total segment span seems lower but this among is already not a small amount in the Mainland China situation. So, we AIA China really focusing on working with the selected affluent segment in each of these strategic end partnership.\nLee Yuan Siong: Okay, on ASEAN itself, I think we have a long history in ASEAN significant scale supported by our strong operating models with a proven track record. You know, we've discussed more about Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. But outside of these three markets, I think the region continue to offer enormous growth potential with very low insurance penetration and growing affluent population, overall no more than $500 million addressable market for AIA. Now, maybe I would like to invite Leo, to talk about two of the very important, perhaps potential markets, which is Indonesia and Philippines.\nLeo Grepin: Good morning, Michael. Its Leo here. As you've described, we also see great potential in the remaining markets of ASEAN with very large population and rising GDP per capita, which presents significant opportunity for our business. And in terms of our approach in these markets, what we've been pursuing is a strategy very consistent with what we've done across the rest of Asia, which is focusing our growth on building our premier agency focused on quality advisors, professional trusted digitally enabled advisors, who are serving the affluent enough customers of these geographies. And that's resulted in in a market like Indonesia, for example, and our agents being four times more productive than the industry average. So very similar strategy to our other core markets focus on agency.  We've also been focusing on growing a differentiated bancassurance strategy. And as you know, in those two markets, we're very blessed with partnership with the leading banks in those markets. In the Philippines, we've got a tremendous partnership with BPI Bank, which is a joint venture. And that's been going great last year that deliver double digit VONB growth. Similarly, we've had a great partnership with BCI in Indonesia, which is really the leading premier bank in that market.  And despite the growth of that partnership, we still have a penetration that remains less than 1% of the customer base. So significant growth upside potential. And in across these markets, our focus has been on protection, which means we've got differentiated margins and which are focused on quality last year, we saw increase in VONB margin in the context of the rebound, that of the pandemic. We're supporting these propositions with vitality, which differentiates us from the rest of the industry.  And along with that protection focus, you will have seen last year, we made additional investments in the Philippines with the acquisition of MediCard, which is the one of the leading health maintenance organizations in the market. And that again, positions us well for continued growth with broader propositions across life health and long term savings. So we're very excited about the potential of these markets.\nLee Yuan Siong: I just talk briefly about, Vietnam, we still see excellent opportunities for business in Vietnam. The significant long term economic and demographic growth drivers continue to underpin the business, the life insurance business and life insurance industry going forward. We are focus on strengthening the fundamentals, agency reform with quality recruitment and productivity enhancement, as our key priorities. As the market conditions improve and we continue to invest, we are confident in our ability to grow in this market. And in fact, we're seeing gradual a month or month improvement in a new business volume.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Yuan Siong. Thanks for the question, Michael. We have time for just one last question.\nOperator: The last question comes from Leon Xi of Taiwan Securities. Leon, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nLeon Xi: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. This is Leon. Most of the issues has already been touched by other analysts. So I just have two quick follow ups. One is on Thailand. I appreciate the remarkable progress on FA and I do notice that 39% of ANP will contributed from FA in Thailand. So just wondering if there's a significant difference in the margin from FA channel. So first question is our FA channels margin in Thailand?  Secondly, is still on the capital management framework. I appreciate Slide 31, which is a very important recap of our latest capital management framework. Do we have a comfortable level of free surplus balance we want to maintain in addition to this flow of free surplus? Thank you very much. \nLee Yuan Siong: HakLeh?\nHakLeh Tan : Thank you, Leon. Just your question on margin for FA. So firstly, I just want to highlight that the FA program is a relatively new program, we've been in Thailand for more than 35 years. And an FA program was started less than 10 years ago, we offer the same product range, as far as digital tools to support the entire agency force, both FAs and non-FA. And imagine our focus always been to grow the VONB and as opposed to volume on margin, was encouraging, because our focus on quality recruitment, and together with our digital capability to elevate the productivity overall, we are seeing the individuals as an FA program operating at 2.7 times the productivity of the entire agency force. So I will say, the overall margins are not this similar between FA and non-FA, but we're very pleased with the significant improve in productivity and growth from the FA program.\nGarth Jones : Yes, and on the free surplus level Leon, clearly we have a strong balance sheet. We are happy to have a strong balance sheet that provides financial flexibility and the ability to invest in growing the business. And again, just I think Slide 31 is a good reminder to us all, that AIA is a very unusual business and we're able to deliver strong growth and provide cash returns to shareholders. We think that really sets us apart. And we look to continue to do that going forward.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Garth. Thanks, Leon for the question. And thank you, everybody on the call for your questions. Obviously, if you have any further follow ups, then come through to us at Investor Relations. Thank you very much and good morning.\nLee Yuan Siong: Thanks very much. Thank you.",

      "transcript": "Lee Yuan Siong: Good morning from Hong Kong. And a warm welcome to AIA’s Annual Results Presentation for 2023. Today, AIA has announced a return to very strong profitable new business growth, with VONB up 33% to over $4 billion and ANP at a record high. New business growth is the key driver of the 37% increase in EV operating profit per share and a 350 basis point uplift in operating return on EV to 12.9%. Operating profit after tax was up 7% per share on an underlying basis. We grew our CSM, the stock of future OPAT by 8.4% on an underlying basis, and operating return on equity was up by 50 basis points to 13.5%.  Strong capital generation saw a free surplus increased by 25%, before capital returns of $2.3 billion in dividends and $3.6 billion through the buyback. None of these returns to shareholders, our capital position remains very strong, with free surplus up $16.3 billion. Total dividend per share is up 5% and we have returned $7.2 billion through our ongoing share buyback program. These results again demonstrate the power of AIA's business model that enables us to capture the growth opportunities across Asia and deliver cash returns to shareholders.  Let me explain how we have achieved these strong results before Garth provides more detail on the financials. We have four key growth engines, which together generate 95% of the group's VONB and each of them reported double digit growth in 2023. ASEAN, our largest engine delivered over $1.5 billion, which is more than one-third of the group's total. Excluding Vietnam, where industry wide issues have been impacted new business sales, ASEAN was up 14%, driven by increased productivity from both agency and partnerships, alongside our focus on protection and unit link sales.  When Hong Kong fully reopened in February, we were ready to capture the returning demand from Mainland Chinese visitors for high quality comprehensive suite of products through our multi-channel distribution. Sales to the domestic customer segment also increase, resulting in an overall growth of 82% for AIA Hong Kong.  This excellent performance confirms, AIA as the overall market leader as well as number one in agency and the retail IA channels. And our leading agency is an attractive career choice with new recruits up by 59%. AIA China grew by 28% from February to December, following the removal of pandemic restrictions. Our high quality premier agency generated over 90% of China's VONB with margins exceeding 60% in the second half, and agent productivity more than double that of our peers.  Our joint venture in India, Tata AIA Life, ranked as the third largest private life insurer in 2023 and continue his track record across all channels with VONB up 37%. AIA's excellent new business performance was broad-base across our high quality growth engines, which are powered by an unrivaled distribution platform. Premier agency is at the heart of AIA's distribution and a key competitive advantage, generating over 75% of new business in 2023.  VONB grew by 23%, driven by an increase in active agent numbers and higher productivity. Full adoption of digital tools across the entire premier agency value chain has delivered a material improvement in productivity, recruitment and retention. This ensures that we are able to provide highly attractive opportunities for career agents with incomes up 17% and accelerating momentum in recruitment up 26% in the second half of the year.  We have the world's most professional agency that has been number one MDRT globally for the last nine years. We are also individually the number one in Mainland China, Hong Kong, ASEAN and India. And we have grown MDRT qualifiers by a further 20% in 2023. Proving the success of our high quality model.  Strategic Partnerships expand our distribution rich by bringing complimentary access to large customer pools across our markets. Overall performance in 2023 was excellent, with VONB growing by 58%. Bancassurance was up 42%. Powered by ASEAN, where we’ve flow standing relationships with leading banks, including Bangkok Bank in Thailand, Citibank in Singapore and Public Bank in Malaysia.  We reported equally impressive results from AIA's other growth engines. Our IFA and broker channel more than double VONB in 2023. We regain the number one market position in Hong Kong, achieved excellent growth in Singapore and held the largest share of wallet across our partners in India. Combined with professional advice from our unrivaled distribution, our compelling propositions are difficult to replicate.  Powered by our technology, digital and analytics capabilities, AIA's integrated product ecosystems offer greater relevance in meeting each of our customers evolving needs. We motivate and reward customers for taking actions that positively improve their physical and financial health, help them seek the best treatment and encourage them to save more effectively to meet their evolving needs.  In 2023, we broaden our customer propositions with targeted solutions, including dedicated loyalty programs in Hong Kong and Singapore, tax deductible private pensions in Mainland China, and comprehensive health and wellness solutions in ASEAN and India. AIA vitality is at the core of our ecosystem, helping our customers improve their wellbeing while delivering greater engagement and shared value generation.  Our holistic approach has resulted in us acquiring more than 1.5 million new customers in 2023, up 10% on last year. AIA's customers are increasingly loyal, with very strong growth in repeat sales, and very high persistency. Our performance in 2023 could not have been delivered without the significant investments we have made in technology, digital and analytics.  When I joined AIA in 2020, I said that a step change in how we use TDA was at the heart of our new strategy. And we set out ambitious transformation goals to enhance every aspect of our business. Since then, we have invested around $800 million in TDA, to secure our future success. We have met or exceeded most of our transformation targets, achieving our goal of being a simpler, faster, more connected organization, and a world leader in the use of TDA.  Today, 90% of our technology infrastructure is hosted in the cloud. And our end-to-end STP rate has more than doubled to 85% of all buy service and claims journeys. Cost per transaction has reduced by 32% and we have already achieved recurring expense and claims efficiencies of more than $150 million per year. Our strategy is not just aimed at transforming back office capabilities, but enables a leading customer experience. With 85% of all customer transactions completed within a single day, and highly rated digital apps, AIA ranks first by NPS in seven of our markets.  100% Digital enablement has delivered significant improvements in productivity across our unrivaled distribution platform. With our TDA transformation complete, we have the essential foundation to deploy generative AI across our business at scale. Today, we have shared on our website a separate TDA presentation. This takes you through our journey so far, and our future plans to expand distribution reach and productivity continuously enhance customer experience and grow shareholder value.  In summary, today's strong results executed across multiple growth engines and combined with our unmatched financial flexibility underscores my confidence that AIA is exceptionally well placed for profitable growth.  Now over to Garth.\nGarth Jones : Thanks, Siong. And good morning everyone. I will now take you through the financial results in more detail across growth, earnings, and capital and dividends. An excellent VONB performance for the group was driven by significant increases in each of our five largest markets and double digit growth in 10 of our markets. Amongst these Yuan Siong is already covered our very strong results in Hong Kong and Mainland China.  Breaking out our key ASEAN businesses, AIA Thailand delivered another impressive performance, up 21%, reflecting very strong growth from both our market leading agency and partnership channels. AIA Singapore grew by 10%, with growth from our core agency and an excellent performance in our partnership channel.  While AIA Malaysia delivered another good year building on its excellent growth in 2022, with VONB exceeding $300 million. Excluding Vietnam, VONB from other markets increased by 15%, with the majority of the growth coming from India. AIA's unique portfolio of businesses, diverse products and high quality distribution enable us to deploy capital in high quality, profitable new business that drives long term shareholder value creation.  You've heard me say many times before that we focus on growing total VONB rather than volume on margin alone, given the strong IRRs we achieve above 20% and short payback periods. While reporting margins may vary, if the return on capital of businesses is attractive, we will look to write it and in this way we optimize total value creation for shareholders. Our priority is growing the total dollar value of VONB and in 2023 VONB increased by $1 billion. Hong Kong and Mainland China saw a very strong demand for profitable long term savings products, which drove VONB growth and a modestly lower VONB margin for the group over the year.  In the second half, a more favorable product mix gave rise to an increase in the group's VONB margin to 54.5%. Overall, our product mix remains well balanced between traditional protection and long term savings products. The equivalent new business PVNBP margin was strong and stable at 10%. Reflecting the quality and long term nature of our business. Each of our reportable segments saw a sequential increase in margin in the second half. For the mixture of an increased margin in Hong Kong and Mainland China. And AIA China's premier agency continued to generate industry leading productivity product mix and profitability with a margin over 60%.  Across the rest of the group, a more favorable product mix cause VONB margins to increase in ASEAN. Our ability to meet the full range of customer needs across protection, high quality long term savings and retirement products is a key differentiator for AIA and a major factor in our confidence in the group's ability to deliver future VONB growth. We actively assess channel product and financial dynamics and seek to improve these further while deploying capital in a disciplined way to create optimal value for shareholders over the long term. This approach has not changed since IPO.  EV operating profit was up 33% to $8.9 billion, driven by VONB growth and an increase in the expected return reflecting higher interest rates and risk discount rates. As a result, operating return on EV stepped up to 12.9%, an increase of 350 basis points. Our focus on delivering sustainable VONB growth is a key driver of higher embedded value and increasing operating ROEV.  Within EV operating profit operating variances once again were a small positive. In line with global trends, we've seen an increase in medical claims post the pandemic. The overall prudence within our equity assumptions has absorb this negative experience, which we expect to be temporary as we reprice our annually renewable health products.  To provide in context, our consistently favorable operating variances have added $3.9 billion to EV Equity since IPO. Non-operating movements mainly related to changes in the value of Chinese and Thai equities, as well as interest rate movements over the year. Net of these, EV Equity increased to $76.1 billion before shareholder returns an increase of 7%. After returning $5.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and the ongoing share buyback program, EV Equity was $70.2 billion at the end of 2023. Our EV methodology uses spot market yields and trends overtime to our long term assumptions, which aims to smooth out short term market volatility.  At year end, we updated our long term investment return assumptions with a reduction in Mainland China and increases across the rest of the group. Whilst in aggregate these changes have a positive effect on future distributable cash flows, reflecting higher interest rates, they were offset by corresponding changes in risk discount rates. As a reminder, we have a substantial allowance for risk in our discount rates, with a risk premium of close to 5% for the group, consistent with the levels used since IPO. The net impact of changes to our economic assumptions with less than 1% of EV Equity. Our EV remains highly resilient to short term market volatility for both interest rate and equity market movements.  Now moving to IFRS earnings. CSM growth is a key driver of future OPAT. In 2023, CSM grew by 17% to $58.4 billion before released into profit. The key growth drivers were the $7 billion from new business added in the year and $2.6 billion from the expected return on enforced business. Variances and others of negative $1 billion mainly related to capital market movements.  The CSM release rate remained stable at 9.5% as $5.3 billion was released into OPAT, up 6% on last year. Net of release, underlying growth in CSM was strong at 8.4%. Growing the new business CSM faster than the CSM release rate will drive higher CSM releases and accelerate OPAT growth. OPAT per share grew by 7% on an underlying basis, and our operating margin remains strong at 16.4%  While CSM release was higher, we have seen increased medical claims since the end of the pandemic in line with global trends. You can see that OPAT was affected by $221 million of medical claims variances compared with last year. Our health insurance portfolio is comprised of annual renewable policies, and in response, we are increasing premium rates as policies renew.  Adjusting for these temporary variances and minor IFRS model refinements, OPAT increased by 7% per share. AIA's sources of earnings are high quality, with 70% from insurance services. Regular premiums make up 99% of our total way to premium income, providing very strong future cash flows and ample liquidity on our large enforce book.  Taken together with our geographically diverse portfolio of businesses bounced across the growth engines of Hong Kong, Mainland China and ASEAN. This underpins the resilience of the group's earnings and balance sheet. Our discipline strategy of focusing on value and quality has helped deliver consistent growth in OPAT per share, with a CAGR of 10% since IPO.  Shareholders allocated equity provides a clearer reflection of the underlying drivers of the change in equity. By excluding the mark to market movements on assets and liabilities relating to non-participating business, which are contained within other comprehensive income. As a reminder under IFRS 17, virtually all mark to market movements from participating business flow to insurance contract liabilities and the CSM.  Before returns to shareholders allocated equity increased to $50.7 billion, driven by a net profit of $3.8 billion. The combination of strong OPAT of $6.2 billion and the ongoing share buyback helped drive operating ROE up by 50 basis points to 13.5%. Comparing IFRS new business CSM and comprehensive equity to VONB and EV Equity clearly demonstrates the prudence of AIA's embedded value reporting. We believe that EV and VONB are more representative of shareholder value, as they are based on distributable cash flows after tax, not accounting earnings. Importantly, all expenses as well as regulatory and group capital requirements and all taxes are fully captured within our EV and VONB. With significant allowance for risk premiums in our risk discount rates. Our EV Equity does not reflect an additional $0. 9 billion if we mark to market our medium term notes. In addition, our investment in China post life is included in EV Equity at IFRS net asset value, which is around $1.5 billion lower then China post life's own embedded value.  Finally, capital and dividends. The LCSM coverage ratio is the group's principal regulatory solvency measure, taking a fully consolidated view of local business requirements and is calculated on a prescribed capital requirement basis. While the LCS M is consistent with the capital requirements used to assess regulatory solvency, free surplus continues to be more representative of the capital position for shareholders. The LCSM coverage ratio increased 14 percentage points before shareholder returns, supported by strong capital generation from our enforce business. After returns to shareholders, a solvency position remained very strong, with a coverage ratio of 275% at the end of 2023.  For comparability, we've shown a shareholder view excluding participating business. On this basis, the coverage ratio was higher, with 335%. The sensitivity of our LCSM coverage ratio to mark to market movements on equities and interest rates is small, reflecting the strength of our balance sheet and our robust risk management. Our high quality investment portfolio is constructed to match our insurance liabilities as closely as possible. As a result, 80% of non-par and surplus assets are fixed income, with the vast majority either government and government agency bonds or investment grade corporate bonds. Within this the $30 billion corporate bond portfolio is well diversified across sectors and geographies with more than 1700 issuers. The average credit rating of our corporate bond portfolio is at A minus and our expected credit loss provision at the end of the year was 0. 5% of the portfolio.  In Mainland China, the group's total exposure to real estate bonds and equities and local government financing vehicles is small. And almost all of AIA China's fixed income assets are government and government agency bonds.  In summary, we have strong asset liability management and a high quality diversified investment portfolio. The group's financial position remained very strong, with free surplus increasing by 25% to $22.3 billion, before returns to shareholders. The increase was driven by underlying free surplus generation of $6 billion and reinvestment of $1.3 billion in new business at attractive long term returns. After $5.9 billion returned to shareholders, free surplus close the year at a very strong $16.3 billion.  The Board has recommended an increase of 5% in the final dividend bringing the total dividend for the year to 161.36 Hong Kong cents per share up 5%. The Board continues to follow AIA's established prudent sustainable and progressive dividend policy allowing for future growth opportunities and the financial flexibility of the group. In addition to regular dividends, our ongoing $10 billion buyback program returned 3.6 billion to shareholders over the year. A total of $24.8 billion has now been returned to shareholders since IPO. AIA follows a clearly defined and robust capital management framework. That is the foundation for superior shareholder value generation.  Over the last two years through our disciplined approach, we've deployed $14.8 billion into business growth and significant capital returns to shareholders. We invested $2.6 billion in organic new business at highly attractive returns, generating $9.7 billion of additional shareholder value, which will come through as free surplus generation over time. Our prudent sustainable and progressive dividend policy has returned $4.6 billion to shareholders. We deployed $0.4 billion into acquisitions.  By the end of 2023, the buyback had returned $7.2 billion in excess capital to shareholders, enhancing per share financial metrics and supporting higher ROE. The program is ongoing with $2.8 billion remaining. Our free surplus position while remaining very strong, has reduced to $16.3 billion, mainly driven by the return of excess capital through the share buyback. We believe that our strong balance sheet financial flexibility, highly attractive new business growth and strong cash returns to shareholders set us apart from our competitors.  In conclusion, the group has delivered a strong financial performance in 2023 across growth, earnings and capital and dividends. VONB grew by 33% to over $4 billion. This drove EV operating profit up 33% and operating ROEV increased to 12.9%. On an underlying basis, OPAT per share grew by 7% and CSM increased by 8.4%. Free surplus increased 25% before shareholder returns. Total dividend per share was up 5% and we’ve returned a total of $5.9 billion to shareholders in 2023. Our $10 billion buyback program is ongoing, enhancing shareholder returns and we remain disciplined in our future capital deployment. AIA's robust balance sheet is a key competitive advantage, ensuring we retain our unmatched financial flexibility to invest in the enormous potential for profitable new business growth in the region, fully harnessing the exceptional qualities of AIA.  I’ll now hand back to Yuan Siong. \nLee Yuan Siong : Thanks, Garth. Let me now remind you why AIA is exceptionally well placed to deliver profitable growth well into the future. First of all, we are 100% focused on Asia, which is the most attractive market for life and health insurance in the world. Asian consumers continue to amass high levels of private savings at a rate faster than anywhere else globally. Populations are growing yet aging and with significantly low levels of insurance penetration and limited welfare coverage, there is an urgent need for the personalized products and high quality advice that only AI provides. The potential for our business is immense and our strategy is aligned to these long term structural trends.  I will now take you through how we are capturing the opportunity across our multiple growth engines, starting with Mainland China. The core of AIA China is our full time professional premier agency that is the clear market leader in Mainland China. AIA's agents are even more productive than their pre pandemic peak and outpace the industry with VONB per agent more than double that of peers.  Our success is driven by young, dynamic and entrepreneurial agency leaders who ensure sustainable growth by attracting, developing and retaining the best agents. Universal adoption of our advanced digital platforms drives higher productivity and efficiency while ensuring our strict quality standards are maintained. 93% of AIA's new agents are college graduates or above, and we saw accelerating recruitment momentum in the second half, with new recruits up 16%.  In contrast to many competitors, our agency is growing and becoming more productive, resulting in VONB growth above 20% from February to December. Our premiere agents are equipped with the skills, tools and products to successfully target the sophisticated needs of Mainland China's growing middle class consumers. Where demand for AIA's insurance propositions remains robust. More than 80% of ANP comes from this segment. And each customer holds on average six AI policies, helping them achieve their protection and long term savings goals.  We saw excellent growth in new customers in the second half of the year, providing us with significant additional opportunities as our agents grow these relationships over time. Our overall product mix is high quality, well balanced and profitable. VONB margin increase substantially in the second half to 63.4%, following a favorable shift in product mix and repricing. In 2023, over 95% of our agents sold protection products, which accounted for more than 80% of all policies from new customers. The majority of our long term savings products that were bought by existing customers who already own AIA protection policies.  It is AIA's differentiated premier agency, meeting the evolving demands of China's middle class consumers that sets us apart in this market. And we have significant headroom to grow as we build on our track record of sustained value creation across both our established and new operations. With the pandemic behind us, we have ambitious plans to accelerate growth from our new operations. As you will recall, by deepening our presence in existing geographies and entering new provinces, we significantly enlarge our addressable market.  In 2023, we opened a new provincial branch in Zhengzhou, Henan, and our Shijiazhuang Sales and Service Center in Hebei, was also upgraded to provincial status, allowing us to expand more rapidly. AIA China has also been granted regulatory approvals to enter new major cities in Hubei, and Sichuan provinces. Since 2019, our footprint has doubled to 10 geographies, adding more than 100 million potential new customers to AIA China. And our expansion model is working well. In 2023, agency VONB from our new branches grew by 55% and exceeded 5% of AIA China's agency VONB in the second half.  Notably, VONB margin is at a similar level to our establish operations as we replicate our proven strategy of targeting the middle class with highly relevant long term savings and protection propositions. Recruitment for our newest branches, is also very strong and accelerating, with more than 77% growth compared to the previous year. As we continue to execute our plans, the vast majority of Mainland China's growing middle class population will be within our reach. I have no doubt in our ability to expand that scale, whilst maintaining strict quality standards and our leading customer experience. We are also able to extend AIA China's customer reach through highly selective partnerships with banks that have aligned long-term ambitions and create value for both partners.  While our partners are some of the largest players in the market, we are focused on meeting the holistic protection and long term savings needs of only their most affluent customers. Through our exclusive partnership with BEA and our strategic relationships with Bank of China and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, our average case size exceeds $20,000 U.S. dollars, higher than our average MCV case size in Hong Kong.  Bancassurance is a small part of AIA China's total VONB and we have seen steadily improving new business profitability that is complementary to our core strategy. AIA China is singularly positioned for growth in this dynamic market. We have the unique combination of profitable products addressing the needs of a targeted growing and affluent customer segment and a world class distribution with significant headroom for growth as we advanced our geographical expansion plans.  Next, moving to Hong Kong. AIA Hong Kong was the largest individual contributor to the group's VONB with 82% growth. Our premier agency is the leader across Hong Kong and Macau and agency VONB was up 57%. We are growing capacity and quality with 59% growth in new recruits and more than 40% growth in MDRT qualifiers. Our bank partnerships provide exclusive access to over 2 million customers while leading IFA proposition has seen us return to number one in this channel. AIA Hong Kong's products and services have broad appeal to both domestic as well as MCV customers. We have the number one Net Promoter Score. The launch of the AIA Wealth Management Center in March, provides an ecosystem of integrated health and wealth management services. And we are accelerating our health capabilities through more active medical network management, leveraging amplify health, powerful data and analytics. As a result of our success, I'm very proud that we were the overall market leader by new business in 2023.  Now taking a closer look at the strong return of MCV business in 2023. I'm confident that the demand is sustainable. More than 70% of VONB comes from customers new to AIA and around 60% of policies were bought by customers who reside outside the Greater Bay area. Our agency generated two thirds of MCV business. And we saw growth in both VONB and the number of new policies in the second half. Following an initial search of larger policies after the border reopen, average case size has stabilized in the second half. As you know, we successfully retained the scale of our MCV focus agency through the pandemic. And we have progressively stepped up recruitment supporting very strong momentum in this growing customer segment.  Now turning to our largest growth engine, AIA's ASEAN markets. We are the leading life and health insurer across the region. The combination of our powerful proprietary distribution channels and high quality product mix allows us to deliver superior growth and profitability. VONB in 2023 was 20% above pre pandemic peak levels.  We are the largest and most professional agency in the region, and our long term strategic partnerships with leading banks are key asset for the group. Our propositions are focused on long term protection and unit link products, which in turn drove strong VONB margin of around 70% in 2023, making this a highly profitable growth engine for the group. Our position and performances across ASEAN are solid and consistent.  Let me take you through the three reportable segments, starting with our largest business, Thailand. We are the undisputed leader and have an excellent track record of consistent execution with VONB 60% higher than pre pandemic peak levels. With a 41% market share, our agency is the largest and most professional in Thailand by far. We continue to uplift quality and standards every year, and our highly productive financial advisor program increase headcount by 28% in 2023.  In bancassurance, productivity was up 31%. And we are working closely with Bangkok bank to unlock the significant headroom for growth from its large retail customer base. As a growing market, there is immense potential for AIA in Thailand. Our focus on traditional protection and unit link products ensures our market dominance and differentiates the quality of our growth. In Singapore, we have outperformed the market through our focus on protection regular premium business. Our agency is the most professional, most productive and largest tide distribution force in the market. A quarter of our agents are MDRT. And we rank the clear number one in Singapore.  We are continuing to scale the agency with expansion of both our agency leaders and onboarding new recruits. In the partnership channel, we have strong momentum through Citibank selected high net worth brokers, and we lead the market in employee benefits business. We offer differentiated health and wellness solutions, leveraging AIA's leading regional funds platform and our market leadership in health insurance. We see strong potential for growth from AIA's Singapore, as we can tap into growing domestic demand, as well as Singapore's position as a regional hub.  AIA Malaysia has grown significantly over the last four years, and 2023 was another strong year, with VONB exceeding $300 million. Targeted investments in technology, digital and analytics have enabled us to simultaneously increase manpower and productivity across our leading premier agency, an exclusive partnership with public bank.  Our strong focus on protection, both traditional and unit link delivers a high quality profitable product mix. We are the market leader in health insurance and AIA vitality has been a key differentiator with a very strong pickup by both agents and our customers. I am very proud of our success in Malaysia. And I'm confident that we can extend our track record for many years to come.  Finally, India, where our joint venture, Tata AIA Life provides us with an exceptional platform to capture the tremendous opportunity for life and health insurance. By 2030, the middle class population will reach 1 billion and protection coverage remains very low. Tata AIA Life continue is strong track record, with VONB up by more than 30% in 2023. Driven by an excellent performance in Premier agency, and strong growth in our partnership channel. In eight years, we have advanced from number 17 in the market, to the number three private life insurer in 2023. We are the market leader in retail protection, and we have a balance multi-channel distribution platform.  Our differentiated agencies strategy has made us the number one MDRT life insurer and our focus on growing and enhancing our agency has delivered consistent growth and outperformance against the industry. Our key priority is to build the most professional distribution force at scale that is on par with AIA’s leading premier agencies. Our protection focused strategy, quality distribution, and proven execution ensure that Tata AIA Life is well on its way to capturing India's massive potential.  To summarize, we have multiple growth engines to leverage the enormous opportunities for life and health insurance across Asia. We target a resilient middle class and affluent customer base, through our market leading proprietary distribution, and superior strategic execution, combined with AIA’s unmatched financial flexibility, we are in a unique position, I'm certain, that we can capture the full economics of growth in the region.  In closing, 2023 was a strong year for the group. VONB was up 33%, to more than $4 billion and we achieved growth in all key metrics. We also returned $5.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and the ongoing share by that program. It is AIA’s capacity to deliver growth, earnings and cash that sets us apart from our competitors. I have every confidence that AIA will extend his strong track record of creating value for all our shareholders well into the future. Thank you.\nLance Burbidge : Good morning from AIA Central in Hong Kong. We will now move to the Q&A session, which is by Zoom webinar. If you want to ask a question [technical difficulty]. Together with me today are Lee Yuan Siong, our Group CEO and President; and Garth Jones, our Group CFO. We also have our Regional Chief Executives and other members of the Group Executive Committee with us in the room.  Before we start our Q&A, let me remind you that we've also shared on our website, a separate TDA video presentation this morning. And I hope you have a chance to watch it later if you haven't already watched it. With that operator, over to you for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Let's proceed and our first question comes from Charles Zhou of UBS Securities. Charles, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nCharles Zhou : Okay, thanks. Thanks for giving me this opportunity to ask the question. So I have a three question. First, as you know, there are lots of concern about the China macro slowdown, but I think we're glad to see AIA delivered 20% value of new business growth last year. And also my understanding is that for Hong Kong MCV business we see first, -- sorry, Q4 versus Q3 still see sequential improvement for the MCV value from new business.  My question is, so can you maybe share with us about the outlook for this year for 2024? Or maybe just give us more colors or maybe even some numbers about what about the momentum provider of new business in Mainland China year-to-date, and also for the Hong Kong business, particularly for the MCV year-to-date? My second question, we know that in China, we see a prolonged interest rate down cycle, and also increasingly complex investment environment.  So how does AIA cope with such challenges from the asset and liability perspective? And can you maybe discuss about this separately? And third, you know, we know AIA has purchased I think shares almost up to $8 billion U.S. dollar or 80% of your $10 billion buyback program. And we estimate the current buyback program will be completed in November based on the current purchasing pace.  So in the future, we understand that IRR for new business is over 20%. But what will the company do to improve the capital efficiency and also enhance the shareholders return? Maybe talk about a for maybe any future buyback or dividend increase? Thanks. \nLee Yuan Siong: Thank you, Charles. First, I think we talked about Hong Kong, our Hong Kong business grew very strongly. VONB was up by 82% in 2023. Growth came from both MCV and domestic Hong Kong market, I am confident that the demand from MCV business is sustainable and in fact, we see we saw very strong VONB growth momentum in the first two months of the year. And I'm also confident that there is a significant need for long term protection and savings from both domestic and MCV customer segments. Jacky, you like to supplement?\nJacky Chan: Yes. Thank you, Yuan Siong. Yes, I'm also very happy to talk about Hong Kong, Hong Kong really demonstrate very strong underlying growth drivers. So for our core agency channel, you can see that the underlying driver in terms of recruitment grow strongly by a 59%. And in fact, the quarterly recruitment in the second half of the year already exceed the pre pandemic level.  And we also see that on the MCV side, which you also talked about, the MCV active agent in the second half grew by 23%, compared to the first half. And our overall, both domestic plus MCV together are all for productivity of our agent by ANP per active agent. Actually strongly beyond the pre pandemic level already. So we have a very, very strong agency force. And we already talked about the MDRT qualifiers, intervention fee is already grown by more than 40%. So this sets a very strong fundamental in the agency business in Hong Kong going forward.  And at the same time, you also see that AIA Hong Kong achieved number one in the IFA broker channel for the whole industry in Hong Kong. And the IFA brokers come to partner with Hong Kong because we have a strong brand, we have a strong product proposition, and we have strong servicing to help them service those more affluent customer segments. So, as a result. I want to let you know that as you asked about the year-to-date, the year-to-date momentum in the first two months is very, very strong.\nLee Yuan Siong: On China, very strong growth from since the pandemic reopening from February to December last year, we grew by 28%. And we saw the momentum continue into the first two months of this year with strong double digit growth. We have a very resilient model and very differentiated model in Mainland China, that's able to grow through economic cycles. We are in a very unique position in that we can expand into new provinces our geographical footprint over the last five years’ double.  We are in 10 geographies now and we continue to plan for future new provincial branches are one to two a year. So I think we are in a very, very unique position and we are very confident of the growth prospects. In China we are servicing mainly -- we are servicing our target customer segment the middle class and affluent customers who are more resilient and through different economic cycles we have a very professional premiere agency channel that is -- and we were able to maintain our agency force, in fact we've seen growth in our agency force as compared to the market, the productivity of our premier agency force is more than two times stead of the industry average. Now, Jacky?\nJacky Chan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. Let me describe a little bit more about how differentiated A channel in China, Both, the agency channel and the partnership channel are really differentiated, as to our core distribution channel in China, which is our premier agency aligned the market situation, we are able to grow the overall agency manpower, driven by strong recruitment momentum, as you have seen in our second half new agent grow year by year by 16%. And our active agent also grow in the last year, and also driven by a strong, very, very strong increase in the agency productivity.  In fact, I also want to share with you that our experienced agent productivity in the second half of last year, already grown beyond the pre pandemic level, and our new agent income in last year actually grow strongly also beyond the pre pandemic level. This shows how strong the underlying drivers of our premier agencies are. And in fact, our agency force target the middle class and above customer segment. And in last year 2023, the middle class and above customer segment contribute more than 80% of the ANP.  And in our almost 30 years’ experience in Mainland China, we note that this kind of a middle class and above customer segment in AIA over time, they purchased over on average six policy from AIA China. So that's that demonstrate how strong our differential agency in China are and they are able to capture the growing opportunity in Mainland China. As to the bancassurance, we also employ a very differentiated strategy.  We selectively partner with those bank partners who are really willing to work with us. Targeting their effort and above customer segment, has user already talked about our exclusive partnership with BEA and our strategic partnerships with Bank of China and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank on selected at point of sales, which targeting the affluent and above customer segment, we saw the average ticket size is above U.S. dollar $20,000.  And we are not doing this like a transactional business like the rest. We are nurturing helping the bank to nurture and engage the customer over time, so that we can give them a comprehensive suite of both protection and long term saving product. So as a result, these two channels really differentiate and coupled up with we have tremendous opportunity to expand in Mainland China. We are now across our geography from five provincial license to 10. And there are more to come and we are also growing strongly in our new footprint in Mainland China. So we are very, very positive, the AIA China is well positioned to capture the enormous opportunity in Mainland China.\nLee Yuan Siong: I hand over to Garth, to talk about the low interest environment in China and about capital.\nGarth Jones : Yes. Thanks, Yuan Siong and Jacky. As you know, Charles we adopt a basis of matching assets and liabilities as closely as we can and that starts with the liabilities. So as you know, we focus on selling protection and long term savings products, which have long term surrender penalties, low underlying guaranteed rates and as economic situations move, we will then reprice and adjust our pricing in our bases as we go along.  On the asset side, as you say it is complex in China, but we look to try and make it as simple as possible. We've shown before that the vast majority of our assets are in fixed income, more than 90% of that is in long government bonds. And if you look at the duration of those bonds, more than half are above 30 years. So again, that goes to the basis of matching assets and liabilities as closely as possible. And that then you see come through in our earnings and you know over 90% of the earnings are insurance service based. So that's China.  On capital. As we tried to show in Slide 31. We are disciplined stewards of the shareholders capital. We've deployed close to $15 billion over the last two years. We've maintained a strong balance sheet, our LCSM solvency have tune in 75%. And we have an ability to stand -- withstand market stress. That strength also gives us financial flexibility, it gives us financial flexibility to continue to invest in new business. As you know our ROE is above 20% and the payback is short.  We've invested $2.6 billion in new business trend, and that's generated $9.7 billion of new business value. We have a prudent progressive sustainable dividend policy. $4.6 billion returned in the last two years as well as the buyback. And as you correctly know, we're in year three of a three-year buyback program a $10 billion share buyback program. So, we will look at ways in which we continue to manage the balance sheet be this disciplined stewards of the shareholder capital. We have a number of levers to do that, but the best lever that we have is to grow our business, grow the business organically. We look to increase AER, we also to optimize that.\nLance Burbidge : Okay, thanks. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from MW Kim from JP Morgan. MW, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nMW Kim : Thank you for the opportunity. I have three questions. So the first one is about the India. For Tata, AIA 37% value of a new business growth looks impressive, and company achieved the top three position among private life insurers in terms of the new life sales volume. I guess that now the scale looks sizable even compared to the AIA Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. So, I want to know when we would see the separate VONB or the EV disclosure of the India operation. And also the management view on any challenges or the issue relate to the ownership increase on Tata AIA it's appreciated.  The second one is about the claim. Just want to ask that whether the claim experience our role would remain the more favorable after the repricing or the premium hike. Just wondering because it sounds like the overall their claim pressure looks actually the happening across the Asia, so to get more insight on that one. And the last one is, the company has designated as an International Active Insurance Group by IAIS recently on top of GWS designation by IA. So under this designation is there anything the mind pool in terms of the future use of excess capital? Thank you.\nLee Yuan Siong: Thank you, MW. We are very happy with our performance in India, India is an exciting market for EIA, and we had an outstanding partner in Tata Sons, I think the best partner you can ever find in India. As you mentioned, we are very proud of the fact that we were able to climb from number 17 to number three, largest private life insurer in India over the last eight years. So, in terms of the when we will disclose more information about Tata AIA, I handover to Garth?\nGarth Jones : Yes. Thanks MK, MW, as you know, I also have sort of management responsibility for India. So I have a vested interest in this. I want the business to grow to a size where it's big enough to break out. I think, a couple of things to remember. Number one is that we have 49% and it's a joint venture. So we're only putting 49% through, we're not putting 100% through and then taking the minority interest out below the line.  It continues to grow. And as it continues to grow, we'll look to, we put more information in the pack. We'll look to give you more disclosures. And I know that there's a lot of disclosures locally as well. It was the largest contributor to the growth in other markets. And but clearly it's a relatively new company as Yuan Siong said, it's grown from 17 to three in the last eight years. So the enforce book isn't quite as representative as the new business.\nLee Yuan Siong: In terms of claims, as you know, we are the largest Pan Asian health insurance insurer. And we see in line with global trends, we seen an increase in the medical claims post pandemic. See, three reasons, one is people who have put off non-urgent medical screening and treatments during the pandemic coming back. Secondly, an increase in preventative checkups, following higher awareness, post COVID. And three, spike in seasonal illnesses from causes like respiratory viruses that were suppressed during the pandemic. We expect these impacts on profitability to be temporary. And we are taking a number of actions to support sustainable medical costs management solutions. Maybe, Kevin, you want to talk about it?\nKevin Loh: Thanks so much. This is Dr. Kevin Loh, Group Chief Healthcare Officer. Maybe give a little bit more color to what Yuan Siong said. So post pandemic years indeed, the healthcare demand has returned to its expected trajectory after being suppressed in 2020 to 2022. And as Yuan Siong say, there is some additional temporary increases in demand. But medical inflation has always been there, we have always been able to deal with it. Our medical portfolio is essentially yearly renewable bases. And though there were repricing constraints during the pandemic years, we are now ready to put through the repricing to catch up.  Now in addition, we have launched our integrated health strategy, where we will steer customers into more seamless cost effective health care networks. We will reduce unnecessary costs and claims while maintaining excellent clinical outcomes. And all this will help us ensure health products remain attractive going forward and make our business sustainable. So we are continuing to ride the growth and health care.\nLee Yuan Siong: Yes, Garth. \nGarth Jones : On the AAIG point. As you know AIG was subjected to group wide supervision by the Hong Kong AIA, and they have a group supervisory framework that is in place robust framework. A key element of that is the LCSM solvency ratio, or the solvency coverage that you see on Slide 27. And the 275% is clearly demonstrably strong. I think the key thing to note is that the sensitivities on the right, you can see that the sensitivities are relatively small.  The other thing I would note with the GWS framework is that it includes a second pillar, which is an economic capital assessment that we provide to the IA. And clearly, the LCSM coverage ratio is as it is, we haven't had to adjust anything for that. The third thing to note, I think is that the free surplus still remains the basis that we would ask people to look at that we think is more representative of shareholders, resources and so on. Whereas the LCSM coverage ratio is clearly designed around the strength of the balance sheet from a policyholder protection perspective.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kailash Mistry of HSBC. Kailash, please press the unmute button on your screen and answer your question.\nKailesh Mistry : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. I've got three questions. First one is on China EV assumptions. Just wanted to understand why you've decided to lower the risk premium now, particularly as some would argue that this is in inconsistent with the general uncertainty and lack of confidence in the market overall?  The second question is on Slide 38. Thank you very much for the additional detail. Effectively just wanted to understand on the left hand side of that slide. How long does it take for customers to you know get to six policies per customer? And secondly, on that slide, how many customers do you have in in Mainland China just to try and scale that? And the last question is a little bit more clarity just around medical claims, et cetera, is the main message here that the 400 million charge on CSM and EV is essentially the assumption change that you’ve? And then the operating variances through the OPAT is essentially the adverse experience this year. And since the entire portfolio re prices from 2024 you know that we should get a clean set of numbers on the medical side. Thank you. \nLee Yuan Siong: Okay. Thank you I think we take the second question first about China. I think I am very happy to see very strong 21% growth in new customer saw in China. And as you can see, we are very much focused on the middle class and affluent customer segment and who will have a long term relationship with the company and throughout the different life stages, they will be buying more and more products from AIA.  And as I mentioned earlier, our model whereby we are servicing these more resilient and more affluent customers who are more resilient through different economic cycles in terms of their spending on insurance and on savings, I think insurance that we are able to grow through different economic cycles. As I mentioned, just now, we've seen a very strong return to growth in 2023. And this is carried forward into 2024 in the first two months of this year.  Now, in terms of the six policies per customer, I think I hand over to Jacky. \nJacky Chan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. In fact, you will see that we grow new customer strong double digit value last year, and the total individual customer AIA China is actually approaching 4 million, and it is still growing quite strongly. And in terms of the six policy per customer, as I said, it is our enforce data. So, AIA has been returned to our home in Mainland China in 1992. So, by now, it's about 32 years, and you know, the trajectory of those our business starting small and then we grow strongly expensively, we grow very strongly after the IPO of AIA Group in 2010.  So, this six policy can for middle class and above customer is an enforced as of now. So, you may imagine that is roughly I would say, or roughly 10 years now, because of the scale of more customer in the later part of this 32 years, compared to the first half of the 32 years. So this gives you a sense that it is really, really a lucrative customer segment that we are able to target on because they will keep buying policy.  And you can see that we also picked up in this on this lag over time, they bought two CI and 2.5 medical and accidental 1.5 long term save and you know that long term savings just started to become more attractive, the customer, especially the middle class, and above customer now become more attracted to long term saving plans. So you can see there are really a lot of potential to continue to grow beyond just six policy per customer for middle class and above. \nLee Yuan Siong: And, so just add. This is a -- as we show this for China, this is not unique to AI China, you know, is our very differentiated highly professional premier agency model whereby our agents will service their customers for very long periods of time, throughout the different life stages. And in Hong Kong in other markets. We also see, and we are also encouraged by the fact that in 2023, we add on more than 1.5 million customers in our major markets. And now the question is on China EVs functions and the questions about the medical claims, I think I hand over to Garth. \nGarth Jones : Yes, thanks Yuan Siong. I think with the assumptions, firstly, to say the first thing to remember always is that we manage the business for the long term, and our AV methodology and our assumptions reflect that. That was assumption based on a wide range of reference points, we have a strong process around that, that goes through our audit process. That includes looking at spot rates, forward rates, and we get a fundamental view from a third party and so on.  Looking at that and looking over the longer term, we look at both the risk free interest rates and the risk discount rates in order to measure the risk premium as you know. In China specifically, we reduce the risk free rates and we reduce the risk discount rates. The key thing to note is number one is on as we show on chart 19 that we've been prudent in our assumptions with the long term rates compared with market rates moving together, but slowly over time, and generally being conservative and prudent.  And then secondly, that there's still a substantial amount of risk premium in our risk discount rates. So in China, for example, that is now 5.7%, which is above our average, and our averages stayed about the same since its IPO. In terms of the medical claims, there's a $500 million provision for expected claims in both our IFRS and EV assumptions for the CSM, as you say, we reflect current experience through the higher premium rates and the repricing that we're going through the medical experience that we showed of $221 million actually flows through in a couple of areas, it flows through operating variances, and also in what's called risk adjustments release another. That's where the corporate solutions businesses, for example. And we've given an indication of the impact of that.  I think that $221 million has to be also viewed in the context of a premium volume from that business of around $5 billion. So a relatively small percentage. We're obviously taking proactive management actions will reprice our products, but also, as Kevin has said, well, we are looking at what we are doing with our integrated health strategy to support sustainable medical cost management and thereby also reduce premium increases for our policyholders.\nOperator: Next question comes from Thomas Wang of Goldman Sachs. Thomas, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nThomas Wang : Thank you. Thanks for the opportunity. Couple question, early if I stay on page 38. Thanks for providing that VONB product mix. Can you just help us or give a little bit color in terms of what that would look like I say last year and how management think this mix will change in 2024 and going forward. And secondly, on capital, if I sort of flipped the dividend question to a leverage question what -- as you think about shareholder return? And also the LCS, what's the target leverage ratio? Or that management have in the medium to long term? Thank you.\nLee Yuan Siong: Okay. Jacky? \nJacky Chan: Yeah, thank you for the question. In fact, I think on the Slide 38. This shows that we continue to maintain a strong sales and momentum in the protection policy. It makes up roughly 40% of the VONB. And the key thing you will have to see that you said we want to let you know that our agents really continue to sell potential policy because more than 95% of our agency last year, they did sell a protection product. And in fact, in terms of new business by a number of policies, more than 80% of them protection, and among the protection will be more than 70% CI products.  I continue to uphold, how A China is so passionate in quickly units and protection product, because in last year, we continue to roll out new CI coverage with cancer cell coverage. And in fact, earlier this year, we also launched a new medical and accident potential product with a longer period of premium payments before we knew for. So this attracts a lot of attention and event I want to continue to let you know that going into the first two months in this year, we come to see very, very strong growth and momentum in our protection sales.  That said, as we already mentioned a lot, right now in the current market situation and the Mainland customers especially middle class and above customers are peppers, they really consider positively that long term saving plan from life insurance office is a good wealth management product for them. And therefore, we continue to see that there is strong demand in our long term saving product and at the same time, the government continue to promote personal pension preparation. So our flagship Personal Pension Benefit Plan continue to attract attention from the middle class and above customers in Mainland China. \nLee Yuan Siong: I just want to add that, we have always been very clear that we focus on growth in the total VONB rather than just focusing on sales volume or margin alone. And we continue to be very financially disciplined. And we will write new business if returns on capital, attractive for us short payback periods in order to drive growth, earnings and cash. So I just want to supplement than.\nGarth Jones : Yes, thanks, Yuan Siong, and thanks Thomas. Yes, as I said earlier, we're always looking at ways in which we can optimize the E using various tools. We have a strong balance sheet that provides us with financial flexibility not only for, to withstand stress, but to take advantage of all the growth opportunities that are available to us. We clearly have a strong balance sheet, our ratings reflect that. And we have a modest leverage ratio. That gives us financial flexibility and we'll continue to look at how we optimize our capital structure going forward. We'll continue to look at how we optimize E.\nOperator: Next question comes from Richard Xu, of Morgan Stanley. Richard, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nLee Yuan Siong: Can you hear us?\nRichard Xu: Yes. Can you hear me? Okay. \nLee Yuan Siong: Yes, now, okay.\nRichard Xu: Okay, thanks for the opportunity. Two question for me. One is, first of all, on the Hong Kong MCV business, it's been strong, certainly compared to the market, but overall market is some slowing down from, also what we see in China, right, in the income growth and macro environments quite divergent recoveries, I mean, there's different levels of recovery in different regions. So, from what you see 70% outside is what doing right now, and what's really driving the market share gains. And looking ahead, where do you see the MCV overall market is growing the growth rate? And then which region, what type of middle class, I guess, insurance buyers are coming to Hong Kong and supporting the growth? And secondly is for overall region and we see the other region has been somewhat weak. I mean, I see, management mentioned, Vietnam is key driver, and other any other driver for the other bucket. And when do we think the overall other regions going to see some rebound in terms of the VONB growth? Thank you. \nLee Yuan Siong: Okay. On Hong Kong MCV business, as I said just now, I believe that the demand from Hong Kong MCV business is sustainable. I think MCV Mainland Chinese customers, they come to buy our products. One, I think there's a lower risk appetite now for risky wealth management products and property investments in China. They want to access, higher quality better health care services. There's a need for currency and asset diversification. So, I think this demand remains very strong. We see that in the fourth quarter of last year there's a continued uptick in MCV business quarter-on-quarter, and we are seeing the momentum carrying forward into 2024 with strong MCV demand in the first two months of the year. Jacky? \nJacky Chan: Yes, very happy to talk about MCV, because MCV has been a part of the Hong Kong insurance business for nearly two decades. And the demand or continue to remain very strong because of many other fundamentals as Yuan Siong just mentioned. And in the case of AIA, AIA’s differentiated channel across agency bancassurance and IFA, we are really well positioned to capture these MCV opportunities.  So as you mentioned about the so called slowdown of the MCV in the market, you may observe these trends in the overall Hong Kong user market as released by the Hong Kong IA, for the whole year 2023. But in the case of Hong Kong, AIA Hong Kong, we saw growth in both ANP and VONB from MCV, going from Q3 to Q4.  And we also already mentioned about, our agents are very well prepared for the MCV and the ramp of MCV we focus that we could increase in the second half of last year, which already surpassed the quarterly average of 2019. And also, the MCV active agent has a strong double digit growth of 23% in the second half. And in fact, when you look at the MCV visitors to Hong Kong has over the last year, the overall visitor number is just roughly 50% of 2018, which was the peak of the Mainland Chinese visitor before 2019, which was a little bit impact by social event.  So you see, there is still you know, a very big room of the tourists coming from Mainland to Hong Kong. And you also saw that just recently, the Hong Kong government and the Chinese government announced that they open up two more additional cities in Mainland China to allow solo travel to come to Hong Kong, they are from Xi An and also Qingdao, and this is the first time in the last 16 years, opening up two more big cities to allow solo traveler to come across the border to visit Hong Kong. So I would say all this, really see that the strong momentum should be there. And in the case of Air Hong Kong in the first two months of this year, Yuan Siong already mentioned, we continues to see a very, very strong growth and demand on our product and services from the MCV customers.\nLee Yuan Siong: Now, Hong Kong and China, two very important strong growth engines for AIA, but we also have ASEAN and India. And in fact, ASEAN is our largest contributor to group VONB last year of 35%. And, in fact, ASEAN contributed to more than $1.5 billion of VONB. And this is actually 20% above pre pandemic levels. Right. So these are very important growth engine for AIA. We have obviously within ASEAN as we mentioned, Vietnam is going through some market wide issues which has impacted the whole market but outside of Vietnam, we're seeing they're seeing good performance from businesses from ASEAN as a whole.  India again, just now we mentioned, very strong performance 37% growth in 2023. Within ASEAN itself, we have Thailand, which is our largest business in ASEAN and we are clear market leader in Thailand for Life and Health Insurance. In fact, Thailand is standout because in 2023 VONB from Thailand is more than 60% above pre pandemic levels, with market share 41% in agency and agency is a very strong contributor, the main contributor of VONB for Thailand business. And obviously, of course, we also have Bangkok Bank and Bangkok Bank, we saw 31% increase in productivity in 2023. Within ASEAN, we also have Singapore where we outperform the market and deliver double digit new business growth in 2023. So.\nOperator: Next question is from Edwin Liu of CLSA. Edwin, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nEdwin Liu : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the opportunity to ask question. Just one quick question for me. And just to follow up on your insurance comments on Thailand. We noted that the strong performance in Thailand with record high margin, so just to want to get more color on the Thailand performance. What's the major reason to drive the margin higher, and do you believe that the margin has reached a peak or maybe normalized in the later years?  Or is this sort of a normalized level right now? And also regarding the IFA program, it seems after previous year's efforts, finally started to deliver results. And in terms of the growth for the FA numbers, should we expect the double digit growth can continue for the medium term, say, three to five years down the road? That's my question. Thanks.\nLee Yuan Siong: Thank you for asking a question on Thailand, because we are all really happy to talk about Thailand. The clear market leader number one in MDRT, as I mentioned, 41% agency market share, and very happy that the European following us and following developments with regard to the IFA program. VONB from FEs [ph] is more than double the level in 2019. And we continue to be able to see very strong growth in FE headcount and contribution from FEs to the overall VONB of the company. I hand over to HakLeh to talk about Thailand a little more.\nHakLeh Tan: Thank you, Yuan Siong. Thanks Edwin for the question. As Yuan Siong mentioned, AIA Thailand deliver excellent results in 2023, VONB was up 21% and 60% higher than the pre pandemic level. Just on our agency, we are the clear market leader with 41% market share. The success of our agency was driven by our quality recruitment program, particularly the financial advisor program, as well as our ability to continuously enhance the productivity of our agency force.  As you are correctly pointed out, the FA program has been around for a while, in fact, it's been around for more than seven years. I think over that period, we can see the program has grown from strength to strength, as of last year the FA contribute to close to 40% of the total production of agency and with an average productivity of 2.3 times of the non-IFA. So the program that will continue to drive our agency growth. And it's also worth noting that most of the new agency managers that we have over the last few years, are individuals who graduated from the FA programs, and most of them, many of them on to become agency leaders, and continue to help us to grow and promote the IFA programs by recruiting a lot more quality individuals into the program.  Just in terms of our overall product proposition, we offer a very comprehensive range of product proposition covering life CI health, as far as long term savings, and as well supported by our best in class digital platform covering the entire customer engagement journey. And we also have done the best in class digital marketing capabilities in Thailand.  We believe Thailand is a growing market with substantial protection gap, is also a country with an aging population that requires more long term savings. Demand for our product propositions and our professional advice is a strongest ever. And we have a strong local team with proven track record of execution. So we're confident that AI Thailand is very well placed to capitalize on the future potential in Thailand.\nOperator: This question is from Michelle Ma of Citi. Michelle, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nMichelle Ma : Thank you for the opportunity. This is Michelle from Citi Research. I have two questions. First is the use of free surplus. So very simple calculation here. So given the very stable $6 billion underlying free surplus generation every year. So this is enough to fund new business at around $1.3 billion and then support progressive dividend payout about $2.3 billion. And assuming no significant investment variance, so can we say the company has a capacity about $2.4 billion every year for capital management such as buyback or extra dividend payment to maintain a stable free surplus balance? This is the first question.  And second question back to China. So, really appreciate the new chart on the Page 38, about the product mix of China agency portfolio. So I think this is really informative and really helpful. So the question is, so we notice for the private pension and retirement products, so the margin is high is over 65% bigger than the margin. So just wonder, the mix within this saving products, we're still seeing continued gain in the product mix of this particular long term savings product since the beginning of the year. And what's the approximate margin for the remaining other long term savings? So yeah, just want to have a sense on this. Thank you.\nLee Yuan Siong: Yes, thank you for your question. Let me take the question on China. And as you see, we are very happy that last year, we saw a good proportion of our product mix in the private pension product, just to let you know, right now the private pension product only allows through a number, a few major cities, and the Mainland Chinese customer already announced that they will expand this product and make it available to more major cities.  So this is a very good news, especially for AI in China, because our agent, high quality agent and their target customers segment, those that need to pay meaningful income tax. So if you ask talking about you're looking forward there, I will say this private pension product will continue to be a major product on long term saving from the agency channel of AIA China.  And in terms of the margin question, in fact, margin are very healthy across all the long term saving products, and our agency channel continue to maintain a overall margin of close to 60%, which is a very healthy and strong margin. Garth, on free surplus.\nGarth Jones : Yes, thanks, Michelle. And clearly, as you say, we've generated good underlying free surplus generation, you've seen that in the last two years, we've continued to grow free surplus. You've also seen that we've deployed $14.8 billion of capital and that's reduced the free surplus overall. I think, you know, as I said earlier, we consider ourselves disciplined stewards of shareholder capital.  And obviously, one of the things is a strong balance sheet, you didn't mention an increase in the stress capital that we might need as this balance sheet grows, which would have to be obviously taken into account. But clearly, we're in year three of a three-year buyback program. We'll continue and we'll do our business planning, we look for a long term business. We'll continue to look at not only growing up as we've done again last year, but also optimizing E as we've also done last year, as we go forward.\nOperator: Next question comes from Michael Lee of Bank of America Securities. Michael, please press the unmute button on your screen and as your question.\nMichael Lee : Hi, thank you. This is Michael Lee from Bank of America Securities. So I have two questions. The first question is about Page 40. So, you mentioned that in January ‘24 this year, you saw an increase of VONB margin in bancassurance channel quite significantly to above 30%. So, any reason behind this kind of increase because usually bancassurance channel margin is quite low. So 30% is quite decent margin for bancassurance. Is that because of product mix changes, or some fee cards fee changes renegotiation with banks?  And also on this page. In the middle of this page, you mentioned that for BEA products and products via BEA and Bank of China and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank the size policy size is at 20k to 23k. And the product size in China postal savings is at about 5k U.S. dollars. So why this difference in terms of size of these policies? Is it because of the different product strategy or just the difference in client profile? So that is the first question.  The second question is about ASEAN countries, ASEAN markets. So definitely this is the focus of investors when China is weak, I mean, macro is weak. And for ASEAN countries, and you mentioned that the total contribution is 35%. And we know Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia already like top 30%, which means that the rest of the ASEAN markets should have greater potential to grow.  Do you have any detailed strategies in this market like in Indonesia, Philippines, and also Vietnam? Because Thailand is a very, very successful example here. Several years ago, you mentioned that you’re building and recruit those agents and you did a very good job in terms of volume growth and margin improvement. So I think it's important for us to understand what kind of strategies you have in those markets, which are still small but with great potentials. Thank you.\nLee Yuan Siong: Okay, thank you. On the China bancassurance, I think we have a very differentiated bancassurance model. In Mainland China, we partner with a small group of highly selective bank partners targeting the affluent and high net worth customers and it is currently -- it is still a small proportion of China's VONB is incremental to our core agency channel. In terms on the details as I hand over to Jacky.\nJacky Chan: Thank you, Yuan Siong, First of all about our bancassurance. I want to say that in fact a bancassurance are still very profitable for AIA. We see that with the more kind of operationalization of the bancassurance product and compensation to the banks. Actually, this is a very old channel for AIA to grow into, because in the past, the bancassurance has really contributed a very tiny proportion of the business. And you can see that the margin really progressively improves from first half to the second half and then to January. So, the key reason behind is that first of all, the pricing interest rate change, I believe you're also aware of that. So, for the non-product, it has to come down from 3.5% to 3%. So that really also improve the margin in the second half of last year.  And furthermore, there is a so called rationalization of fee to the bank or the compensation. So, I will call it rationalization, so that basically means that it makes it maybe more reasonable. So it becomes a win-win-win situation for the bank for the insurance company and for the customer too, more high quality product can be made available to so full pension of the customer. So due to the compensation rationalization, the margin in January, since January this year actually further improve to beyond 30%. So basically, you can see that the bancassurance channel in Mainland China is already a profitable channel.  And for AIA, we’re focusing on the F1 and above customer segment, you will see that for our exclusive partnership with BEA and strategic partnership with BOC and as PDB our average case size already exceeding $20,000 U.S. dollar, which Yuan Siong mentioned that it is if and beyond the average case size of MCV in Hong Kong. And I wonder also you know that, for the cooperation with the postal savings Bank of China, we also target their affluent segment. But of course, different bank has different level of efforts.  We're focusing on work with the wealth management center, tackling those are more affluent segments within the postal savings Bank of China. And the average case size of $5,000 U.S. is not that small. The average domestic Hong Kong average case is above $5,000 U.S. So it's just a comparison that Oh, total segment span seems lower but this among is already not a small amount in the Mainland China situation. So, we AIA China really focusing on working with the selected affluent segment in each of these strategic end partnership.\nLee Yuan Siong: Okay, on ASEAN itself, I think we have a long history in ASEAN significant scale supported by our strong operating models with a proven track record. You know, we've discussed more about Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. But outside of these three markets, I think the region continue to offer enormous growth potential with very low insurance penetration and growing affluent population, overall no more than $500 million addressable market for AIA. Now, maybe I would like to invite Leo, to talk about two of the very important, perhaps potential markets, which is Indonesia and Philippines.\nLeo Grepin: Good morning, Michael. Its Leo here. As you've described, we also see great potential in the remaining markets of ASEAN with very large population and rising GDP per capita, which presents significant opportunity for our business. And in terms of our approach in these markets, what we've been pursuing is a strategy very consistent with what we've done across the rest of Asia, which is focusing our growth on building our premier agency focused on quality advisors, professional trusted digitally enabled advisors, who are serving the affluent enough customers of these geographies. And that's resulted in in a market like Indonesia, for example, and our agents being four times more productive than the industry average. So very similar strategy to our other core markets focus on agency.  We've also been focusing on growing a differentiated bancassurance strategy. And as you know, in those two markets, we're very blessed with partnership with the leading banks in those markets. In the Philippines, we've got a tremendous partnership with BPI Bank, which is a joint venture. And that's been going great last year that deliver double digit VONB growth. Similarly, we've had a great partnership with BCI in Indonesia, which is really the leading premier bank in that market.  And despite the growth of that partnership, we still have a penetration that remains less than 1% of the customer base. So significant growth upside potential. And in across these markets, our focus has been on protection, which means we've got differentiated margins and which are focused on quality last year, we saw increase in VONB margin in the context of the rebound, that of the pandemic. We're supporting these propositions with vitality, which differentiates us from the rest of the industry.  And along with that protection focus, you will have seen last year, we made additional investments in the Philippines with the acquisition of MediCard, which is the one of the leading health maintenance organizations in the market. And that again, positions us well for continued growth with broader propositions across life health and long term savings. So we're very excited about the potential of these markets.\nLee Yuan Siong: I just talk briefly about, Vietnam, we still see excellent opportunities for business in Vietnam. The significant long term economic and demographic growth drivers continue to underpin the business, the life insurance business and life insurance industry going forward. We are focus on strengthening the fundamentals, agency reform with quality recruitment and productivity enhancement, as our key priorities. As the market conditions improve and we continue to invest, we are confident in our ability to grow in this market. And in fact, we're seeing gradual a month or month improvement in a new business volume.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Yuan Siong. Thanks for the question, Michael. We have time for just one last question.\nOperator: The last question comes from Leon Xi of Taiwan Securities. Leon, please press the unmute button on your screen and ask your question.\nLeon Xi: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. This is Leon. Most of the issues has already been touched by other analysts. So I just have two quick follow ups. One is on Thailand. I appreciate the remarkable progress on FA and I do notice that 39% of ANP will contributed from FA in Thailand. So just wondering if there's a significant difference in the margin from FA channel. So first question is our FA channels margin in Thailand?  Secondly, is still on the capital management framework. I appreciate Slide 31, which is a very important recap of our latest capital management framework. Do we have a comfortable level of free surplus balance we want to maintain in addition to this flow of free surplus? Thank you very much. \nLee Yuan Siong: HakLeh?\nHakLeh Tan : Thank you, Leon. Just your question on margin for FA. So firstly, I just want to highlight that the FA program is a relatively new program, we've been in Thailand for more than 35 years. And an FA program was started less than 10 years ago, we offer the same product range, as far as digital tools to support the entire agency force, both FAs and non-FA. And imagine our focus always been to grow the VONB and as opposed to volume on margin, was encouraging, because our focus on quality recruitment, and together with our digital capability to elevate the productivity overall, we are seeing the individuals as an FA program operating at 2.7 times the productivity of the entire agency force. So I will say, the overall margins are not this similar between FA and non-FA, but we're very pleased with the significant improve in productivity and growth from the FA program.\nGarth Jones : Yes, and on the free surplus level Leon, clearly we have a strong balance sheet. We are happy to have a strong balance sheet that provides financial flexibility and the ability to invest in growing the business. And again, just I think Slide 31 is a good reminder to us all, that AIA is a very unusual business and we're able to deliver strong growth and provide cash returns to shareholders. We think that really sets us apart. And we look to continue to do that going forward.\nLance Burbidge: Thanks, Garth. Thanks, Leon for the question. And thank you, everybody on the call for your questions. Obviously, if you have any further follow ups, then come through to us at Investor Relations. Thank you very much and good morning.\nLee Yuan Siong: Thanks very much. Thank you.",

    "fullTranscript": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to American Airlines Group's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNeil Russell: Thank you, Latif. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group earnings conference call. On the call with prepared remarks, we have our CEO, Robert Isom; and our CFO, Devon May. In addition, we have a number of our senior executives in the room this morning for the Q&A session. Robert will start the call with an overview of our performance. Devon will follow with details on the quarter in addition to outlining our operating plans and outlook going forward. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin today, we must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast of capacity and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release and Form 10-Q that was issued earlier this morning. Unless otherwise specified, all references to earnings per share are on an adjusted and diluted basis. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found in the Investors section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information we are giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert D. Isom: Good morning, everyone. This morning, American reported an adjusted pretax profit of $869 million for the second quarter or earnings per share of $0.95, which is toward the high end of the guidance we provided in April. We achieved this in a difficult and evolving operating and demand environment, and we're proud of our second quarter performance. We remain steadfast in our focus on our 2025 priorities, which will continue to shape the long-term success of American. Executing on these priorities will enable us to grow margins, generate sustainable free cash flow and further strengthen our balance sheet. Our priorities this year include delivering on our revenue potential, renewing our focus on the customer experience, operating with excellence and driving efficiencies throughout the airline. We're pleased with the progress we've made on each of these fronts, and we'll share more on them this morning. Let's begin with our performance during the second quarter. In the second quarter, we produced record revenue of $14.4 billion, a testament to the progress we're making on our commitment to deliver on our revenue potential even in a challenging environment. Our year-over-year passenger unit revenue improvement led our network peers for the fourth straight quarter. Long-haul international PRASM performed in line with our initial expectations with all entities producing positive year-over-year results. Driven by continued strength in the premium cabin, Atlantic PRASM was up 5% and Pacific PRASM was up approximately 1% year-over-year on approximately 17% more capacity. Premium demand and spending from higher-income consumers remained resilient in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, unit revenue in the premium cabin performed 4 points better than the main cabin. We're well positioned to attract premium customers with plans to expand our premium seating further in the years ahead. The strength in international and premium was offset by domestic leisure weakness. Domestic unit revenue was down approximately 6% year-over-year as softness in the main cabin persisted throughout the second quarter. While domestic unit revenue is expected to remain lower year-over-year in the third quarter, we expect that July will be the low point and that performance will improve sequentially each month in the quarter as industry capacity growth slows and demand strengthens. As shown on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation that we published this morning, the efforts of our sales team to recover revenue from indirect channels beat our expectations in the quarter, with our indirect share now down 3% versus historical levels. We saw the greatest sequential improvement in indirect leisure channels, but we continue to make progress in corporate channels. We remain on track to get back to our historical share of indirect channel revenue as we exit 2025. In the second quarter, we grew our managed business revenue by 10% year-over-year, outpacing broader industry growth. This result is further confirmation that our sales and distribution efforts are being well received by our customers. Our work to grow the AAdvantage program and enhance our partnership with Citi is continuing as we prepare for the start of our new 10-year agreement in January 2026. Slide 5 highlights that active AAdvantage members have grown 7% year-to-date with our highest growth in enrollments coming from Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth and New York. AAdvantage members are more engaged, generate a higher yield versus nonmembers and are a key driver for premium cabin demand, currently accounting for approximately 77% of premium revenue. Spending on our co-branded credit cards was up 6% year-over-year for the second quarter as customers continue to favor AAdvantage miles as their preferred rewards currency. American remains committed to offering an industry-leading travel rewards program, and we look forward to sharing more exciting updates in the months ahead. The further strengthening of our network remains a key priority for the team. In the second quarter, our growth was focused on Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, 3 strategic hubs critical to our network and where we continue to see long-term opportunity. We're encouraged by the early results from this additional capacity with share, unit revenue and financial results tracking in line with or ahead of expectations. We'll remain responsive to the demand and competitive environment as we execute our long-term network strategy, and we remain focused on deploying capacity that best serves our customers. Our new customer experience organization is elevating every part of the travel journey. We've continued to make meaningful improvements across all phases of the customer experience. We've announced several exciting updates to our lounge network, including opening a new flagship lounge in Philadelphia. In Miami, we've announced plans for a new flagship lounge and are expanding the Admirals Club lounge footprint. American is proud to offer more premium lounges than any other carrier. Later this summer in Charlotte, we'll open Provisions by Admirals Club, a new, unique and additional lounge concept for customers that are seeking a quick refreshment before catching their next flight. The new flagship suite on our Boeing 787-9 officially entered service last month on select flights to London. In this winter, this premium offering is expected to expand to Argentina, New Zealand and Australia, giving more customers the opportunity to enjoy this elevated experience. Customer response to the new aircraft and flagship suite product has been overwhelmingly positive. We want our customers' experience at the airport to be as easy and as seamless as possible. In May, we implemented TSA Touchless ID, which significantly expedites the security screening process. Additionally, we're the first airline to test one-stop security for flights into the U.S., starting with American flights from London to Dallas-Fort Worth, allowing customers to bypass baggage reclaim and TSA rescreening upon arrival. We're excited to be the first carrier to implement one-stop security, which will greatly enhance the connecting experience and overall journey for our customers traveling internationally. Thank you to the Department of Homeland Security for its continued partnership and commitment. We've also introduced several additional customer enhancements during the quarter, including an option for customers to use miles as a form of payment for upgrades and improvements to our in-flight food and beverage offerings. We're excited about the momentum we've built, and we're just getting started. Our customer experience team is undertaking a comprehensive review of every phase of the travel journey and making investments that will deliver tangible improvements for our customers and our revenue performance. Turning now to our operation. The team has continued to plan, execute and recover through very difficult operating conditions this summer. Disruptive operating conditions are a reality of our business, and the American team continues to do an excellent job recovering from irregular operations and mitigating the impact to our customers. In the second quarter, there was significant storm activity at our hubs in Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and in the Northeast, a 36% increase in disruptive operational events over the same period last year. Thanks to the investments we've made in technology and our operations and our team's continued focus on controlling what we can control, we were able to recover quickly from these disruptions. A big thank you to the entire American Airlines team for continuing to deliver for our customers in the midst of a very challenging operating environment. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the families and communities affected by the catastrophic flooding in Central Texas. American is a proud Texas-based airline, and we've joined forces with our disaster response partners, the American Red Cross, Airlink and Team Rubicon to aid relief efforts and support impacted families. Now I'll turn the call over to Devon to share more about our second quarter financial results and outlook.\nDevon E. May: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Excluding net special items, American reported a second quarter operating margin of approximately 8% and earnings per share of $0.95, both at the high end of our guidance. Our second quarter revenue of $14.4 billion was up 0.4% year-over-year. Second quarter unit cost, excluding fuel and net special items, was up 3.4% year-over-year, over 0.5 point better than the midpoint of our guidance. This is a result of the team's continued strong execution on our efficiency initiatives and a shift in timing of maintenance events to later in the year. This resulted in an EBITDAR margin of 14.2%, a 1.5 point reduction year-over-year, which is similar to the year-over-year margin decline of our network peers. This is a great result considering the current domestic demand environment and our differentiated position, which includes the relative domestic weighting of our network and paying full market rates for all of our largest labor groups. We are committed to running the airline as reliably and efficiently as possible while continuing to improve our revenue performance and enhance the customer experience. These efficiencies are driven by best-in-class workforce management, efficient asset utilization and procurement excellence and are unlocked by investments in technology and process improvements. By year-end, we expect to have driven cumulative savings of over $750 million and delivered approximately $600 million of working capital improvements since we launched our reengineering the business efforts in 2023. During the second quarter, we raised $1 billion through a loyalty term loan financing and used the proceeds to cash settle our $1 billion convertible note earlier this month. American ended the second quarter with approximately $38 billion of total debt and $29 billion of net debt, our lowest net debt levels since the third quarter of 2015. We ended the second quarter with $12 billion of total available liquidity. In the quarter, we produced $791 million of free cash flow and have now produced $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year. We anticipate having positive free cash flow for the full year. With regard to our fleet, we now expect to take delivery of 50 new aircraft this year at the high end of our previous range of 40 to 50 deliveries. This is driven by earlier-than-planned deliveries of several aircraft that we now expect to receive in the fourth quarter, a few months earlier than our previous expectation of the first quarter of 2026. Based on these expected deliveries, our 2025 aircraft CapEx, which also includes used aircraft purchases, spare engines and net PDPs is now expected to be between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, and our total CapEx is expected to be between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. We continue to expect moderate levels of CapEx in future years with annual aircraft CapEx averaging approximately $3.5 billion for the remainder of the decade. I'd now like to walk you through our outlook for the third quarter. We continue to be mindful of both the demand and competitive environment as we develop our capacity plans for the remainder of the year. For the third quarter, we expect capacity to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year. Our year-over-year domestic capacity is up by approximately 5% during the July peak, but growth will slow to approximately 2% in August and will be down 1% in September. We expect third quarter revenue to be between down 2% and up 1% year-over-year. We expect July to be one of the year's weakest year-over-year RASM performing months given the higher industry capacity and that the month was largely booked prior to the strengthening demand trends we have seen over the past couple of weeks. But we believe the worst is behind us and year-over-year revenue will sequentially improve each month this quarter. Third quarter nonfuel unit costs are expected to be up 2.5% to 4.5% year-over-year, driven primarily by the collective bargaining agreements we have ratified over the past 2 years. This performance is in line with the second quarter, but on a lower rate of growth. We expect similar performance in the fourth quarter given the shift in maintenance expense from the second quarter to the fourth quarter. Based on our current demand assumptions and fuel price forecast, we expect to produce a third quarter loss per share of between $0.10 and $0.60. Based on recent demand trends, we expect full year earnings per share of between a loss of $0.20 and a profit of $0.80, with the midpoint being a profit of $0.30 per share. We believe the top end of the range is achievable if demand in the domestic market continues to strengthen, and we would only expect to be at the bottom end of the range if there was macro weakness that we don't see in our recent booking trends. We are proud to be forecasting a profit in a year where we have faced the challenges of a tragic accident, significant and continued ATC delays, unprecedented weather, the full financial cost of new collective bargaining agreements and a material drop in demand in the domestic market where we produce over 70% of our revenue. It is a testament to the durability of our business and the resilience of our people. I'll now turn the call back to Robert for closing remarks.\nRobert D. Isom: Thank you, Devon. In closing, we're pleased with our second quarter results and the hard work of the American Airlines team. This year has been challenging, but our team has skillfully managed through an uncertain demand environment and difficult operating conditions to deliver a safe and reliable operation for our customers. We're confident that we're delivering on the right long-term initiatives. With our continued focus on execution, we remain on track to deliver for the long run. We believe American is uniquely positioned to benefit as domestic demand recovers in the back half of the year. With that, operator, you may now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan Securities.\nJamie Nathaniel Baker: So Robert, you and I had a constructive exchange, in my opinion, back at the March Industrials Conference. So I wanted to kind of stick to that theme following some of the more recent OA disclosures. What we heard from a competitor when discussing the industry landscape is that several airlines are operating a double-digit percentage of their flights at a loss. So I guess my question for you, Robert, is twofold. First, can you give us an approximation maybe on a full year basis to adjust for seasonality, what overall percentage of American flying loses money and maybe how that's changed and evolved in recent years? And then second, is there a path towards a more modest percentage of loss producing flying? How do you accomplish that? What are the upside drivers?\nRobert D. Isom: Okay. Thanks, Jamie. And I'll just start with -- we don't run our airline based on other airlines' perceptions of our business. We run and have a fantastic hub-and-spoke network system, a great set of partners. We're really proud of what we do. And on a system basis, if you take a look at our results today, the primary differentiator between us and some of our competitors is largely 2 things. One, we're paying our team members at market wages. Others are benefiting from not doing that. I'm sure that, that will catch up over the long run. And the second thing is we do have a network that we're proud to say is more oriented to the domestic network. And let's face it, the domestic network has been under stress because of the uncertainty in the economy and the reluctance of domestic passengers to get in the game. We think that, that's going to change. We think that's going to be a tailwind for us. And especially as demand and capacity come back in more in the balance, it's going to fit very well with the things that we're doing to make American really thrive in the long run, delivering on our revenue potential, improving our customer experience playing into premium, taking advantage of international. We're going to be having some international growth. And it's all based on -- or all keyed off of an incredible level of efficiency. So I feel proud of what we got.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research.\nConor T. Cunningham: Two, if I may. You mentioned a sequential improvement in the U.S. domestic market as you think about through 3Q. There's obviously been a wider range of outlooks from some of the other players out there. So I was hoping that you could help frame up what you actually see within your U.S. domestic performance from maybe July to September. Does it just track the capacity plans? And the reason why I ask is like, obviously, things changed in July, and you talked about how you were basically fully booked for July. So if you could just talk about where you're booked for the remainder of 3Q and then maybe 4Q, that would be super helpful.\nRobert D. Isom: Sure, Conor. I can start. But I just want to note that our Vice Chair and Chief Strategy Officer, Steve Johnson, he's recovering from a case of pneumonia, not with us today. He's fine, but getting some rest and is on the mend. So I'll start and hand it over to Devon. Look, when we take a look at what we've got on the books right now, July has been tough, really hit hard by the uncertainty during the primary booking period for those that wanted to travel in July. And as we take a look through the third quarter, we probably have about 65% of revenue on the books. I think that's probably plus or minus right, and about 20% on the books for the fourth quarter. So there's a lot to go and good reason to have a lot of optimism for some of the trends that we're seeing going from July into August and September and into the fourth quarter. But also, look, we've had a lot of volatility in the business so far, and we want to be mindful of that as we forecast as well. Devon?\nDevon E. May: Yes. Not much to add. Like Robert said, we will see sequential improvement throughout the quarter. July is going to look a lot like our second quarter results. But as we get into August and September, we're going to see some nice improving trends there and expect that to continue into Q4.\nConor T. Cunningham: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe I could talk -- maybe we got to ask a little bit about just earnings baselining. Obviously, a lot has gone on in the first half of this year. And the question that I get is just around like, what the actual potential of the business is now that you've kind of gotten back to a level of demand where I think is sufficient to maybe what you were thinking in January. So if you could just talk about what the headwinds that you faced in the first half of this year and what you don't necessarily expect to repeat next year. I think that would be helpful as we start to think about '26 and beyond.\nDevon E. May: Yes. We're obviously a ways off of run rate earnings right now, and we see a lot of potential for margin expansion as we go forward. And it's everything Robert has talked about, and it's everything we've talked about over time. Like as we look out for the next 6 months, domestic marketplace is going to improve, and that's a great tailwind for us. As we head into next year, we expect that to continue, and we're going to start benefiting from our new credit card agreement with Citi, which we're incredibly excited about. We continue to invest meaningfully in the customer and the premium experience, which we think is also going to drive nice tailwinds for us. So this year, obviously, a really tough first half. We think we're going to get some nice tailwinds as we head on into the second half and expect expansion as we head into 2026.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine Maureen O'Brien: Two questions. First one, a bit of a follow-up to Conor's. Can you just speak on how you're thinking about capacity and unit costs versus January? Within the low single-digit and mid-single-digit ranges you're expecting, have things shifted at all? And then I know this is early, but this year, I think you had a couple of points of pressure from new labor contracts. Can you just speak to like headwinds and tailwinds we should be thinking about into next year?\nDevon E. May: Sure. This year is largely unfolding as we expected to start the year. First quarter, we had guided to CASM up 8% for a lot of reasons that we had talked about, mainline regional mix, labor expenses, a reduction in capacity. We came in just inside of that. Second quarter, we had guided to CASM up 4%. Again, we came in just inside of that number and felt good about it. We're executing on all of our different cost initiatives. We did benefit in the second quarter with some maintenance expense that pushed out to Q4. And so we're going to see a similar unit cost trend to what we saw in the second quarter for both the third and fourth quarter. So at the midpoint, unit costs up probably somewhere around 3.5%. As we head into 2026, it's early. It's going to be somewhat dependent on our capacity production. But I'd just say, over the long term, I think we've done an exceptional job managing costs. We spent the last couple of years really focused on reengineering the business for efficiency, and that's across the entirety of our business. And I think we're doing a really nice job with it. So that's the outlook for this year. And I think in '26, we'll continue to perform really well relative to the rest of the industry.\nCatherine Maureen O'Brien: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one on the indirect revenue share, if I could. I saw that came in better than expected in the second quarter. But on an operating margin basis, the gap to peers is about the same this quarter. It was in the second quarter of last year with indirect revenue much more recovered. Is there an element where revenue share is getting close to historical levels that's more volume driven than it was before the distribution strategy change and there's some element of pricing that recovers over time in those contracts? Or is it the margin pressure is coming from the relatively higher domestic exposure and maybe more market labor rates versus one of your peers you spoke about earlier in the call. Just would love to unpack that.\nDevon E. May: Yes. Thanks. You hit it exactly right at the end. Like it's -- to me, it feels like a pretty incredible result that our margin performance year-over-year was very much in line with our peers. In a quarter where we know the weakest part of the business was the domestic marketplace, and we have more exposure to domestic. And like you said on the cost side, we are faced with the full cost of newly reached collective bargaining agreements. At least one of our peers isn't in that position yet, but will be eventually. So for us to produce the same year-over-year margin in that environment seems like a really great result. And you see it in the unit revenue numbers. We've had 4 straight quarters of relative outperformance on unit revenue. It's just hard to have that flow through to margin or relative margin when you have these types of differences.\nRobert D. Isom: And Catherine, I'll just add, one of the other proof points is the corporate managed traffic that's improved 10% year-over-year in a relatively flat business market. We're not done yet. And that's the point, I think, is really important. We've got a few percentage points more to get back to where we were prior to the sales and distribution strategy change. But we've got even more from that because we know that our network and our team is capable of delivering at higher levels. I do believe that the last few percentage points going to be hard. But also, I think that they're going to be the most profitable points we bring in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS.\nAtul Maheswari: This is Atul Maheswari on from Tom Wadewitz. Robert, if I heard you right, did you say that you're expecting a full recovery in indirect channel market share as you exit 2025? So if you could please confirm that? And related to that, are you able to quantify what would be the revenue lift that we should expect for 2026 as you run rate the 2025 exit rate to all of next year?\nRobert D. Isom: Well, Tom, I'll start with the first with is just getting back to our historical share. As we exit 2025, we're on track to getting -- restoring our full indirect channel share. And what that means is that as we exit the year. So it's not embedded in the full year 2025 results. But as we move into 2026, I expect to see that come through. We talked last year about that representing $1.5 billion of revenue. There's a good chunk of that that's going to flow through, and we're really pleased with our performance getting back on track.\nAtul Maheswari: Okay. And then as my follow-up, just following up on some of the questions that have been asked already. But if we look at your profit margins, relative to your network peers, just it would seem based on the outlooks that all of you have provided this year that your margin gap even at the EBITDAR level is likely to widen this year. So really, as you look out over the next few years, what do you think American really needs to do to make progress in bridging this gap? And do you think there are any structural impediments to American actually fully bridging this gap over time?\nDevon E. May: Well, I'll just start with last year. At the end of last year, we had a 2-point EBITDA margin gap to United, inclusive of Delta's third- party business. We had about a 2-point EBITDA margin gap to them as well. And that's a gap that we expect to close over time. This year is an unusual year for all the reasons we discussed, and you have to probably dig a level deeper. One, we're -- we have a larger domestic exposure than either of our large network competitors. Two, we have -- we're just at different cycles with where we are at with collective bargaining agreements. We have all of ours in place. One of our competitors does not. So not everything is going to come through in margin in a linear fashion. But we do think over time, yes, we expect we can close that margin gap. We don't think there's anything structural. We had talked about what we think are some of the key reasons around it, inclusive of your first question, sales and distribution is something that was a headwind last year. It remains a headwind for us this year. But coming into next year, we think it will be a tailwind to margin. We've talked about our Citi agreement. There's been a gap to our peers there. We think we have an incredible partner and an incredible agreement in place, and we're going to close that gap over time as well. And we like a lot of the work that we're doing on the commercial side of the business, including some really nice investments in premium and premium customer, which we think will help as well. So there's a gap today. and there will be a gap this year, but we do expect to close it heading into 2026.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Shannon [indiscernible] on for Mike. So American recently agreed to drop its lawsuit against Chicago Aviation authorities. Where do you guys stand today? And what does it mean for your schedule later this year and early next year out of Chicago? Presumably, you thought you'd have more slots and not less than we have.\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks for the question. And regarding Chicago, this is a tremendous opportunity for American. We've been slowest to rebuild out of the pandemic our network for a number of reasons, largely because of pilot shortfalls in our regionals. But now that we have full ability to staff, we're in good shape. And so you'll see Chicago hit 485 peak departures, and we're on our way to producing even more than that, over 500 as we take a look into next year. We have the gate capacity we need to fulfill that growth and even more. And in terms of the status of the litigation, we feel really good about where we're at. We worked with the city to design and finance the expansion in Chicago. And all we're asking to do is have them live up to what they said they would do in terms of gate allocation. So we're not concerned. We've got what we need now, and we're going to have what we need going forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: And if I just may follow up, on the Embraer tariffs, we've heard that some airlines don't have to accept delivery of airplanes. Is that going to be the case with you and Embraer assuming that current tariff goes through?\nRobert D. Isom: Embraer is a terrific partner. And the E175s are just an exceptional aircraft with soon to be satellite-based WiFi and full first-class cabin. And so it fits really well. We're proud to be the operator of the world's largest fleet of Embraer aircraft, and that's unique to American. We're working with Embraer on deliveries, but we don't anticipate any long-term issues. As a matter of fact, we know that the Brazilian government is working with the administration and Embraer as well. And so over the long run, we know what's best. There's a tremendous amount of U.S.-based content on those Embraer aircraft, and there's a lot that goes into negotiating trade deals. So we stand by ready to help in any way, and we've made sure that the administration and Embraer knows our interest and we're confident we'll be taken care of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America.\nAndrew George Didora: So Robert, you've been speaking a lot about your revenue share in indirect channels. When I think about share more broadly, right, like your capacity growth has been trailing your network peers for the past 6 or so quarters. I guess as we move forward from here, are you content with growing less than your peers and driving that RASM outperformance that you've been getting? Or does there come a time when share matters and you need to maybe at least grow in line with some of your primary competition? Any thoughts around that?\nRobert D. Isom: Sure. It's always a balance. And it's something that we're going to make sure that we have a network that takes care of our customers in a way that they -- we need to serve them and that we can do so profitably over the long run. We're super pleased with the hub network that we're fortunate to have. Our hubs are based in the metro areas that are growing the fastest in the United States. You've seen from some of our recent announcements about the new terminal F in DFW. It's going to allow DFW to be the world's largest hub. We're confident that our hubs will support more growth. And specifically, as we look into 2026, you're going to see us make sure that we restore our share in Chicago. You're going to see us continue to build Philadelphia, which has been really a bright spot. And you'll also see us continue to invest in Miami. All that goes with a tremendous domestic network that is ultimately the anchor to help support international growth. And our fleet is going to allow for more of that. And I like the opportunity we have to play both in the international market and premium space as well. So good things on the horizon from that perspective. We're going to take care of our customers.\nAndrew George Didora: Got it. And just my second question here. I know you've spoken about kind of your corporate revenues growing 10% in a flattish market. I guess -- can you more quantify the demand improvement you've seen of late that just gives you the confidence to speak to the accelerating revenue growth despite the tougher comps as we head into the back half of the year?\nRobert D. Isom: Yes. It's just booking trends, and it's especially what we see coming from June moving into July. And then as you move into August and September, we feel really confident in terms of an improving capacity and supply environment and American benefits, and we should benefit more than others given our exposure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line David Vernon of Bernstein.\nDavid Scott Vernon: So Robert, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the investment in sort of the customer experience. And I want to ask it in kind of two ways. One, first, kind of as you look at yourself relative to your peers, where are the big opportunities for you to improve the customer experience? And as you talk to investors about this, like how are you thinking about measuring this? Is it Net Promoter Scores? How are you going to kind of judge the performance on improving the overall customer experience? Obviously, it will eventually show up in the bottom line. But I'm just wondering how are you thinking about talking about your progress on this journey to improve with investors and analysts?\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks, David. Appreciate the question. First off, we're going to measure this by our customers' perception and by revenue performance, okay? So first off, we will evaluate our Net Promoter Scores. That will be a huge driver. And as well in terms of revenue performance, this is going to be -- we're doing this to improve premium revenues and revenue overall. So unit revenues will be the metric that we take a look at. And so in terms of where we're at, we've had a long history of first in terms of customer experience enhancements and improvements, and we're building on that. So whether it's the new flagship suites on our 787s, which will soon be on our 321 XLRs, which then will also be on our 777-300s that are being reconfigured. That all plays into that our premium lounge network, which is larger than anyone else. You heard our Philadelphia announcement, Miami, and there will be more on that. A lot of that is built into the capital spending that we've already planned. So I would suggest that there's not a lot of catch-up on that front. You will see us invest in our food and in-flight amenities. And again, you will see us continue to avoid -- to invest in the premium experience. Where I look at opportunities going forward, though, it really is the ability to serve that premium customer, especially internationally as well. And we have a fleet that is ideally suited to do that. So those adjustments that I described, they're all going to result in the ability to serve almost 50% more premium customers in premium seating as we move out into 2030. And from an international perspective, our fleet is going to allow us to serve more or actually improve flying by almost 50% or more than 50% as we move out into 2030.\nDavid Scott Vernon: And I guess as you think about kind of where you guys stand relative to peers in terms of Net Promoter -- or do you guys benchmark that at all?\nRobert D. Isom: We do. And we think it's a great opportunity. It's something, again, that is on a front that we take very seriously. It starts with running an exceptional operation. And we've been hit with our share of challenging operating conditions this summer, certainly in June and July, no place has been hit, no airline has been hit as hard as American. So it starts with running a reliable operation. We're making sure that we can recover as quickly as possible, investing in technology on that front. And then moving from there, it really is making sure that we have the basics and those things that are just essential for competition. And then there are some things that you're going to see us play in that we'll look to even outpace the competition. And on that front, it's all designed to improve our customer experience and revenue performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.\nDuane Thomas Pfennigwerth: So depending upon how we interpret the guide for 3Q, maybe there's slight sequential improvement in RASM depending upon how the quarter plays out. But I wonder how would you rank your enthusiasm for sequential improvement by entity, maybe domestic versus Atlantic versus Latin? And do you see a path back to positive RASM for domestic this year?\nDevon E. May: Duane, I'll just say this about the environment right now in Q3 versus Q2. In the third quarter, domestic is going to be better, but it starts with a month of July that's going to look very similar to what we had in the second quarter. But we do expect improvement beyond that point, and that's actually the entity where we expect to see the most improvement. Transatlantic, we had outstanding performance in the second quarter. As the Iran conflict was heating up, that was during a pretty decent booking window for Q3. So we do expect a little bit softer performance in the Transatlantic in July and August. But by September, we think it's going to be performing really nicely again. The rest of the network, I think there's probably some pressure in short-haul Latin, long-haul, Latin and Transpacific will probably perform pretty similarly to what we saw in Q2. But when we look at it in totality, we really like the environment that we're in now versus where we were a couple of months ago. And especially as we get to the back end of this quarter, we think there's some really nice potential for positive unit revenue ahead. That's not baked into the guide. Obviously, we're going to have negative unit revenue this quarter at the midpoint. But we do think as we head out to the fourth quarter, there is potential for positive unit revenue performance.\nDuane Thomas Pfennigwerth: And then I may have missed it, apologies if I did, but you guys have been pretty good at keeping your capacity in kind of this 3% range, basically for all the quarters of this year, you made some comments about early deliveries. Does that change the trajectory for the fourth quarter? Or do you lean harder on retirements? Or is it just a rounding error?\nDevon E. May: There may be a little bit more capacity that comes in, in the fourth quarter with deliveries. It's not going to be a huge amount, though. Just on retirements, I think you may be aware, we don't have any aircraft retirements that are necessary between now and the end of the decade. So for us, when we're managing capacity, it's really just being tight around utilization during the off-peak periods. And I think we were pretty quick to react here in the third quarter, at least for -- these periods like August and September, which are traditionally lower demand periods. As we head into the fourth quarter, though, we like the demand trends we're seeing, and I think we're going to put the right amount of supply in the market to meet that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavanthi Nipunika Prelis-Syth: Just a clarification there, sorry. So on the domestic capacity side, with the declines, is that solely related to just taking off-peak capacity out. So as you get into the fourth quarter, you'll see that step up again? Is that how you're thinking?\nDevon E. May: Well, I'll just say fourth quarter capacity isn't finalized yet. But yes, in the third quarter, like we would in a normal year, we pulled capacity down in August and September. This year, just given the trends we have been seeing in demand as we went into the second quarter, we pulled August and September down more than we normally would. Some of that capacity would naturally come back in the fourth quarter, which is traditional seasonality, and that's what I would expect again this year.\nSavanthi Nipunika Prelis-Syth: Makes sense. And then on the operations front, it seemed like that was one area that you had really improved kind of versus where you were maybe pre-pandemic over the last few years of this year, clearly, more issues. And I wonder if you can kind of -- is it really down to DCA and weather? And if that's the case, I mean, weather might not change. Like how do you manage through this? Because it seems like the metrics have gotten worse at American versus peers, even though you are kind of recovering better.\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks, Savi. Look, I think American runs the most reliable, safe operation possible at all times. I'm really proud of our team and the way they've been able to recover. Let's just go through some of the things that we've dealt with. First off, June saw regular operations up 35% plus over the prior couple of years. And just go ahead and multiply that by 2 or 3x as we moved into July. I said earlier today on another call that -- we've had almost 800 diversion events and 5,500-plus weather cancellations just in the first 3 weeks of July. Now that is not something -- that is something that will continue long into the future. It's an anomaly. And we've seen that now that heat has kind of come back into the summer and we're more in a normal cycle. We're going to make sure, though, that we do the things that make American as resilient as possible. And so whether that's investing in a little bit in the schedule to create some redundancy, extra resources, technology, we're putting AI to use to make sure that we have the best recovery plans and options for our customers out there. So I feel good about our ability to manage through we do need investment in air traffic control. One of the issues that we're facing today is it's unique to us is a slowdown out of DCA. We had the aircraft incident earlier in the year. And -- but I fully expect that we will recover from that, and that will no longer be an impediment. So over the long run, I think that weather normalizes for everyone. I think that American, because of what we do and how we've operated during a really difficult environment, we're going to shine over the long run. And I feel really good about that. So a couple of other proof points. One is that even with these irregular operations, our mishandled baggage rates are improving very, very, very much. And I know that we're doing a great job in getting customers back online when operational events create problems. So there you have it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Fitzgerald of TD Cowen.\nThomas John Fitzgerald: Most of might have already been answered, but I'm curious just how you're thinking about the New York market organically now that seemingly a lot of the inorganic growth options there have been closed off.\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks, Tom. We have a great franchise in New York. We're the third largest carrier with over 260 peak day departures across all 3 airports. Our largest operation is at the preferred New York Airport, LaGuardia, and we have 150 departures there. The new terminal is great. It does come at significant expense, but we're optimizing our network to adjust to make sure we can take New Yorkers to where they want to go and customers that want to go to New York, we're making sure that we have the ability to do that. And so based on what we're doing, we're seeing margin expansion year-over-year. And our oneworld hub at JFK Terminal 8, which I think is really unique to American. We offer a seamless experience with 125 peak day departures across AA and our partners. We've got a great product, especially from a transcon perspective, London Heathrow to New York, the biggest business market in the world. Yes, our New York is more specialized given our network and complements where we're strong in so many other places. But we have the ability to grow as well. And that growth can be through upgauging, and we're always making sure that we're flying to the right places.\nThomas John Fitzgerald: Okay. That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, how -- I don't know if you're able to give us any like sizing or like in terms of like points of RASM, but how are you thinking about, I guess, headwinds from the WiFi for next year and then -- and tailwinds from the improving mix as you take on more premium heavy fleet?\nRobert D. Isom: Okay. So I'll start with that. And Devon, you can pitch in. Regarding satellite WiFi, that's -- it's going to be fantastic. American will be the first carrier to really offer satellite-based WiFi across its entire mainline fleet and everything but our 50 seaters from a regional basis. Those installations are going on and doing very well. We have a wonderful partnership with our satellite WiFi being sponsored by AT&T. That offers a tremendous opportunity for both companies to take care of our customers in the way that they want and find ways to serve them even better. So from that perspective, I believe that based on our partnerships and what we think in terms of consumer sentiment and also usage of the service. I think that we're going to do pretty well, and you won't see much of an impact in terms of the P&L. And in terms -- and I spoke earlier about the work that we're doing from a premium product perspective. We've got a fantastic foundation. And whether it's our facilities, our lounges, the aircraft that we're coming in that are already built into our capital plan, yes, we're going to augment that a little bit with amenities and service and we'll do that, but that won't have a material impact either.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: I guess on New York, I was curious what you all made of the United-JetBlue arrangement. How compelling do you think that will be? And how much of a step back is it that American wasn't able to come to some other agreement with JetBlue?\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks, Ali. Look, we had a creative relationship with JetBlue for a number of years that really benefit customers. Unfortunately, we couldn't maintain that long into the future. And so we haven't had the benefit of that for a couple of years now. We -- as I mentioned before, we like our New York franchise. It's specialized, but it's centered on those things that really, I think, are most meaningful, not only to our network, but our customers, transcon and international service and really taking New Yorkers where they want to go and making sure that we have a great schedule from all of our hubs into the New York region as well. New York is one of the places that we've grown. Our AAdvantage enrollments actually even at a faster clip than we have in the last couple of years. So we know that we have a fantastic customer base there. And we'll look for ways to serve them. We have the ability to do some growth ourselves through upgauging. We've got our partner network in our oneworld hub in JFK T8. So I feel really confident about how we're set up and where we're headed going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Just curious if you could talk a little bit more about this weakness you've been seeing with the consumer. Robert, I know that you mentioned the uncertainty going into July. What is that exactly? And what are the signs of that? And just because it differs a bit from what we heard from Delta and American. Sorry, Delta and United.\nRobert D. Isom: Well, I think that differs from what we've said as well. So the uncertainty that is in July is really due to bookings that were made in the second quarter. As we move from June into July, we're seeing the same uptick in bookings that anybody else is seeing. It's been remarkable, and it's something that gives us great confidence as we look into August and September and the third quarter and the early bookings, we only have 20% of revenue on the books for the fourth quarter. But as we look out into the fourth quarter, it all looks very promising. That benefits us because it's largely domestic rebound. And so given our exposure domestically, I think that, that bodes very well. Now in terms of the drivers of the reduction in uncertainty, I think that comes from more stability, tax bill. I think it comes from tariff deals being done with the U.K. recently announced Japan, hopefully something with the EU soon. So all of that bodes well for the consumer. Joblessness is trending in the right direction. While GDP has been pulled down a little bit, it's still positive for the back half of the year. And I think that, that all lends to a customer that's more willing to get out there and spend travel and do some things that they want to do.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. And just one follow-up. One of your competitors was talking about using AI more for pricing. How do you think about that? And is that something that you're considering or already experimenting with?\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks. And I appreciate the question because I, quite frankly, think that some of the things I've heard are just not good. For American, we will use AI to improve our ability to operate the airline. We're going to be more efficient because of it. We're going to be able to -- our team members are going to have an easier time of doing their jobs. For our customers, it's going to improve their customer experience. We're going to be able to give them the ability to see more of the amenities that we can offer. We're going to be able to serve them in a way that when they do run into difficulties that they can recover faster. We have projects underway now that are all aligned in that fashion. We talked about operational difficulties. One of the big AI investments we've made is in a project that we call HEAT that allows us to rebuild the operation as quickly as possible going forward. So for us, of course, we're going to find ways to get our product in front of consumers. But consumers need to know that they can trust American, okay? This is not about bait and switch. This is not about tricking and others that talk about using AI in that way, I don't think it's appropriate. And certainly, from American, it's not something we will do.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks, Latif, and thank you to everybody on the call today. We remain confident that the actions that we've taken to deliver on our revenue potential, strengthen our network, operate with excellence and find ways to drive efficiencies throughout the airline position us well for the long term. I want to thank you for joining us, and thank you for your support and interest. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Neil Russell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNeil Russell: Thank you, Latif. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the American Airlines Group earnings conference call. On the call with prepared remarks, we have our CEO, Robert Isom; and our CFO, Devon May. In addition, we have a number of our senior executives in the room this morning for the Q&A session. Robert will start the call with an overview of our performance. Devon will follow with details on the quarter in addition to outlining our operating plans and outlook going forward. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin today, we must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast of capacity and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release and Form 10-Q that was issued earlier this morning. Unless otherwise specified, all references to earnings per share are on an adjusted and diluted basis. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found in the Investors section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information we are giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert D. Isom: Good morning, everyone. This morning, American reported an adjusted pretax profit of $869 million for the second quarter or earnings per share of $0.95, which is toward the high end of the guidance we provided in April. We achieved this in a difficult and evolving operating and demand environment, and we're proud of our second quarter performance. We remain steadfast in our focus on our 2025 priorities, which will continue to shape the long-term success of American. Executing on these priorities will enable us to grow margins, generate sustainable free cash flow and further strengthen our balance sheet. Our priorities this year include delivering on our revenue potential, renewing our focus on the customer experience, operating with excellence and driving efficiencies throughout the airline. We're pleased with the progress we've made on each of these fronts, and we'll share more on them this morning. Let's begin with our performance during the second quarter. In the second quarter, we produced record revenue of $14.4 billion, a testament to the progress we're making on our commitment to deliver on our revenue potential even in a challenging environment. Our year-over-year passenger unit revenue improvement led our network peers for the fourth straight quarter. Long-haul international PRASM performed in line with our initial expectations with all entities producing positive year-over-year results. Driven by continued strength in the premium cabin, Atlantic PRASM was up 5% and Pacific PRASM was up approximately 1% year-over-year on approximately 17% more capacity. Premium demand and spending from higher-income consumers remained resilient in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, unit revenue in the premium cabin performed 4 points better than the main cabin. We're well positioned to attract premium customers with plans to expand our premium seating further in the years ahead. The strength in international and premium was offset by domestic leisure weakness. Domestic unit revenue was down approximately 6% year-over-year as softness in the main cabin persisted throughout the second quarter. While domestic unit revenue is expected to remain lower year-over-year in the third quarter, we expect that July will be the low point and that performance will improve sequentially each month in the quarter as industry capacity growth slows and demand strengthens. As shown on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation that we published this morning, the efforts of our sales team to recover revenue from indirect channels beat our expectations in the quarter, with our indirect share now down 3% versus historical levels. We saw the greatest sequential improvement in indirect leisure channels, but we continue to make progress in corporate channels. We remain on track to get back to our historical share of indirect channel revenue as we exit 2025. In the second quarter, we grew our managed business revenue by 10% year-over-year, outpacing broader industry growth. This result is further confirmation that our sales and distribution efforts are being well received by our customers. Our work to grow the AAdvantage program and enhance our partnership with Citi is continuing as we prepare for the start of our new 10-year agreement in January 2026. Slide 5 highlights that active AAdvantage members have grown 7% year-to-date with our highest growth in enrollments coming from Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth and New York. AAdvantage members are more engaged, generate a higher yield versus nonmembers and are a key driver for premium cabin demand, currently accounting for approximately 77% of premium revenue. Spending on our co-branded credit cards was up 6% year-over-year for the second quarter as customers continue to favor AAdvantage miles as their preferred rewards currency. American remains committed to offering an industry-leading travel rewards program, and we look forward to sharing more exciting updates in the months ahead. The further strengthening of our network remains a key priority for the team. In the second quarter, our growth was focused on Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, 3 strategic hubs critical to our network and where we continue to see long-term opportunity. We're encouraged by the early results from this additional capacity with share, unit revenue and financial results tracking in line with or ahead of expectations. We'll remain responsive to the demand and competitive environment as we execute our long-term network strategy, and we remain focused on deploying capacity that best serves our customers. Our new customer experience organization is elevating every part of the travel journey. We've continued to make meaningful improvements across all phases of the customer experience. We've announced several exciting updates to our lounge network, including opening a new flagship lounge in Philadelphia. In Miami, we've announced plans for a new flagship lounge and are expanding the Admirals Club lounge footprint. American is proud to offer more premium lounges than any other carrier. Later this summer in Charlotte, we'll open Provisions by Admirals Club, a new, unique and additional lounge concept for customers that are seeking a quick refreshment before catching their next flight. The new flagship suite on our Boeing 787-9 officially entered service last month on select flights to London. In this winter, this premium offering is expected to expand to Argentina, New Zealand and Australia, giving more customers the opportunity to enjoy this elevated experience. Customer response to the new aircraft and flagship suite product has been overwhelmingly positive. We want our customers' experience at the airport to be as easy and as seamless as possible. In May, we implemented TSA Touchless ID, which significantly expedites the security screening process. Additionally, we're the first airline to test one-stop security for flights into the U.S., starting with American flights from London to Dallas-Fort Worth, allowing customers to bypass baggage reclaim and TSA rescreening upon arrival. We're excited to be the first carrier to implement one-stop security, which will greatly enhance the connecting experience and overall journey for our customers traveling internationally. Thank you to the Department of Homeland Security for its continued partnership and commitment. We've also introduced several additional customer enhancements during the quarter, including an option for customers to use miles as a form of payment for upgrades and improvements to our in-flight food and beverage offerings. We're excited about the momentum we've built, and we're just getting started. Our customer experience team is undertaking a comprehensive review of every phase of the travel journey and making investments that will deliver tangible improvements for our customers and our revenue performance. Turning now to our operation. The team has continued to plan, execute and recover through very difficult operating conditions this summer. Disruptive operating conditions are a reality of our business, and the American team continues to do an excellent job recovering from irregular operations and mitigating the impact to our customers. In the second quarter, there was significant storm activity at our hubs in Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and in the Northeast, a 36% increase in disruptive operational events over the same period last year. Thanks to the investments we've made in technology and our operations and our team's continued focus on controlling what we can control, we were able to recover quickly from these disruptions. A big thank you to the entire American Airlines team for continuing to deliver for our customers in the midst of a very challenging operating environment. Finally, I'd like to acknowledge the families and communities affected by the catastrophic flooding in Central Texas. American is a proud Texas-based airline, and we've joined forces with our disaster response partners, the American Red Cross, Airlink and Team Rubicon to aid relief efforts and support impacted families. Now I'll turn the call over to Devon to share more about our second quarter financial results and outlook.\nDevon E. May: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Excluding net special items, American reported a second quarter operating margin of approximately 8% and earnings per share of $0.95, both at the high end of our guidance. Our second quarter revenue of $14.4 billion was up 0.4% year-over-year. Second quarter unit cost, excluding fuel and net special items, was up 3.4% year-over-year, over 0.5 point better than the midpoint of our guidance. This is a result of the team's continued strong execution on our efficiency initiatives and a shift in timing of maintenance events to later in the year. This resulted in an EBITDAR margin of 14.2%, a 1.5 point reduction year-over-year, which is similar to the year-over-year margin decline of our network peers. This is a great result considering the current domestic demand environment and our differentiated position, which includes the relative domestic weighting of our network and paying full market rates for all of our largest labor groups. We are committed to running the airline as reliably and efficiently as possible while continuing to improve our revenue performance and enhance the customer experience. These efficiencies are driven by best-in-class workforce management, efficient asset utilization and procurement excellence and are unlocked by investments in technology and process improvements. By year-end, we expect to have driven cumulative savings of over $750 million and delivered approximately $600 million of working capital improvements since we launched our reengineering the business efforts in 2023. During the second quarter, we raised $1 billion through a loyalty term loan financing and used the proceeds to cash settle our $1 billion convertible note earlier this month. American ended the second quarter with approximately $38 billion of total debt and $29 billion of net debt, our lowest net debt levels since the third quarter of 2015. We ended the second quarter with $12 billion of total available liquidity. In the quarter, we produced $791 million of free cash flow and have now produced $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year. We anticipate having positive free cash flow for the full year. With regard to our fleet, we now expect to take delivery of 50 new aircraft this year at the high end of our previous range of 40 to 50 deliveries. This is driven by earlier-than-planned deliveries of several aircraft that we now expect to receive in the fourth quarter, a few months earlier than our previous expectation of the first quarter of 2026. Based on these expected deliveries, our 2025 aircraft CapEx, which also includes used aircraft purchases, spare engines and net PDPs is now expected to be between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, and our total CapEx is expected to be between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. We continue to expect moderate levels of CapEx in future years with annual aircraft CapEx averaging approximately $3.5 billion for the remainder of the decade. I'd now like to walk you through our outlook for the third quarter. We continue to be mindful of both the demand and competitive environment as we develop our capacity plans for the remainder of the year. For the third quarter, we expect capacity to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year. Our year-over-year domestic capacity is up by approximately 5% during the July peak, but growth will slow to approximately 2% in August and will be down 1% in September. We expect third quarter revenue to be between down 2% and up 1% year-over-year. We expect July to be one of the year's weakest year-over-year RASM performing months given the higher industry capacity and that the month was largely booked prior to the strengthening demand trends we have seen over the past couple of weeks. But we believe the worst is behind us and year-over-year revenue will sequentially improve each month this quarter. Third quarter nonfuel unit costs are expected to be up 2.5% to 4.5% year-over-year, driven primarily by the collective bargaining agreements we have ratified over the past 2 years. This performance is in line with the second quarter, but on a lower rate of growth. We expect similar performance in the fourth quarter given the shift in maintenance expense from the second quarter to the fourth quarter. Based on our current demand assumptions and fuel price forecast, we expect to produce a third quarter loss per share of between $0.10 and $0.60. Based on recent demand trends, we expect full year earnings per share of between a loss of $0.20 and a profit of $0.80, with the midpoint being a profit of $0.30 per share. We believe the top end of the range is achievable if demand in the domestic market continues to strengthen, and we would only expect to be at the bottom end of the range if there was macro weakness that we don't see in our recent booking trends. We are proud to be forecasting a profit in a year where we have faced the challenges of a tragic accident, significant and continued ATC delays, unprecedented weather, the full financial cost of new collective bargaining agreements and a material drop in demand in the domestic market where we produce over 70% of our revenue. It is a testament to the durability of our business and the resilience of our people. I'll now turn the call back to Robert for closing remarks.\nRobert D. Isom: Thank you, Devon. In closing, we're pleased with our second quarter results and the hard work of the American Airlines team. This year has been challenging, but our team has skillfully managed through an uncertain demand environment and difficult operating conditions to deliver a safe and reliable operation for our customers. We're confident that we're delivering on the right long-term initiatives. With our continued focus on execution, we remain on track to deliver for the long run. We believe American is uniquely positioned to benefit as domestic demand recovers in the back half of the year. With that, operator, you may now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan Securities.\nJamie Nathaniel Baker: So Robert, you and I had a constructive exchange, in my opinion, back at the March Industrials Conference. So I wanted to kind of stick to that theme following some of the more recent OA disclosures. What we heard from a competitor when discussing the industry landscape is that several airlines are operating a double-digit percentage of their flights at a loss. So I guess my question for you, Robert, is twofold. First, can you give us an approximation maybe on a full year basis to adjust for seasonality, what overall percentage of American flying loses money and maybe how that's changed and evolved in recent years? And then second, is there a path towards a more modest percentage of loss producing flying? How do you accomplish that? What are the upside drivers?\nRobert D. Isom: Okay. Thanks, Jamie. And I'll just start with -- we don't run our airline based on other airlines' perceptions of our business. We run and have a fantastic hub-and-spoke network system, a great set of partners. We're really proud of what we do. And on a system basis, if you take a look at our results today, the primary differentiator between us and some of our competitors is largely 2 things. One, we're paying our team members at market wages. Others are benefiting from not doing that. I'm sure that, that will catch up over the long run. And the second thing is we do have a network that we're proud to say is more oriented to the domestic network. And let's face it, the domestic network has been under stress because of the uncertainty in the economy and the reluctance of domestic passengers to get in the game. We think that, that's going to change. We think that's going to be a tailwind for us. And especially as demand and capacity come back in more in the balance, it's going to fit very well with the things that we're doing to make American really thrive in the long run, delivering on our revenue potential, improving our customer experience playing into premium, taking advantage of international. We're going to be having some international growth. And it's all based on -- or all keyed off of an incredible level of efficiency. So I feel proud of what we got.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research.\nConor T. Cunningham: Two, if I may. You mentioned a sequential improvement in the U.S. domestic market as you think about through 3Q. There's obviously been a wider range of outlooks from some of the other players out there. So I was hoping that you could help frame up what you actually see within your U.S. domestic performance from maybe July to September. Does it just track the capacity plans? And the reason why I ask is like, obviously, things changed in July, and you talked about how you were basically fully booked for July. So if you could just talk about where you're booked for the remainder of 3Q and then maybe 4Q, that would be super helpful.\nRobert D. Isom: Sure, Conor. I can start. But I just want to note that our Vice Chair and Chief Strategy Officer, Steve Johnson, he's recovering from a case of pneumonia, not with us today. He's fine, but getting some rest and is on the mend. So I'll start and hand it over to Devon. Look, when we take a look at what we've got on the books right now, July has been tough, really hit hard by the uncertainty during the primary booking period for those that wanted to travel in July. And as we take a look through the third quarter, we probably have about 65% of revenue on the books. I think that's probably plus or minus right, and about 20% on the books for the fourth quarter. So there's a lot to go and good reason to have a lot of optimism for some of the trends that we're seeing going from July into August and September and into the fourth quarter. But also, look, we've had a lot of volatility in the business so far, and we want to be mindful of that as we forecast as well. Devon?\nDevon E. May: Yes. Not much to add. Like Robert said, we will see sequential improvement throughout the quarter. July is going to look a lot like our second quarter results. But as we get into August and September, we're going to see some nice improving trends there and expect that to continue into Q4.\nConor T. Cunningham: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe I could talk -- maybe we got to ask a little bit about just earnings baselining. Obviously, a lot has gone on in the first half of this year. And the question that I get is just around like, what the actual potential of the business is now that you've kind of gotten back to a level of demand where I think is sufficient to maybe what you were thinking in January. So if you could just talk about what the headwinds that you faced in the first half of this year and what you don't necessarily expect to repeat next year. I think that would be helpful as we start to think about '26 and beyond.\nDevon E. May: Yes. We're obviously a ways off of run rate earnings right now, and we see a lot of potential for margin expansion as we go forward. And it's everything Robert has talked about, and it's everything we've talked about over time. Like as we look out for the next 6 months, domestic marketplace is going to improve, and that's a great tailwind for us. As we head into next year, we expect that to continue, and we're going to start benefiting from our new credit card agreement with Citi, which we're incredibly excited about. We continue to invest meaningfully in the customer and the premium experience, which we think is also going to drive nice tailwinds for us. So this year, obviously, a really tough first half. We think we're going to get some nice tailwinds as we head on into the second half and expect expansion as we head into 2026.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine Maureen O'Brien: Two questions. First one, a bit of a follow-up to Conor's. Can you just speak on how you're thinking about capacity and unit costs versus January? Within the low single-digit and mid-single-digit ranges you're expecting, have things shifted at all? And then I know this is early, but this year, I think you had a couple of points of pressure from new labor contracts. Can you just speak to like headwinds and tailwinds we should be thinking about into next year?\nDevon E. May: Sure. This year is largely unfolding as we expected to start the year. First quarter, we had guided to CASM up 8% for a lot of reasons that we had talked about, mainline regional mix, labor expenses, a reduction in capacity. We came in just inside of that. Second quarter, we had guided to CASM up 4%. Again, we came in just inside of that number and felt good about it. We're executing on all of our different cost initiatives. We did benefit in the second quarter with some maintenance expense that pushed out to Q4. And so we're going to see a similar unit cost trend to what we saw in the second quarter for both the third and fourth quarter. So at the midpoint, unit costs up probably somewhere around 3.5%. As we head into 2026, it's early. It's going to be somewhat dependent on our capacity production. But I'd just say, over the long term, I think we've done an exceptional job managing costs. We spent the last couple of years really focused on reengineering the business for efficiency, and that's across the entirety of our business. And I think we're doing a really nice job with it. So that's the outlook for this year. And I think in '26, we'll continue to perform really well relative to the rest of the industry.\nCatherine Maureen O'Brien: Okay. Great. And then maybe just one on the indirect revenue share, if I could. I saw that came in better than expected in the second quarter. But on an operating margin basis, the gap to peers is about the same this quarter. It was in the second quarter of last year with indirect revenue much more recovered. Is there an element where revenue share is getting close to historical levels that's more volume driven than it was before the distribution strategy change and there's some element of pricing that recovers over time in those contracts? Or is it the margin pressure is coming from the relatively higher domestic exposure and maybe more market labor rates versus one of your peers you spoke about earlier in the call. Just would love to unpack that.\nDevon E. May: Yes. Thanks. You hit it exactly right at the end. Like it's -- to me, it feels like a pretty incredible result that our margin performance year-over-year was very much in line with our peers. In a quarter where we know the weakest part of the business was the domestic marketplace, and we have more exposure to domestic. And like you said on the cost side, we are faced with the full cost of newly reached collective bargaining agreements. At least one of our peers isn't in that position yet, but will be eventually. So for us to produce the same year-over-year margin in that environment seems like a really great result. And you see it in the unit revenue numbers. We've had 4 straight quarters of relative outperformance on unit revenue. It's just hard to have that flow through to margin or relative margin when you have these types of differences.\nRobert D. Isom: And Catherine, I'll just add, one of the other proof points is the corporate managed traffic that's improved 10% year-over-year in a relatively flat business market. We're not done yet. And that's the point, I think, is really important. We've got a few percentage points more to get back to where we were prior to the sales and distribution strategy change. But we've got even more from that because we know that our network and our team is capable of delivering at higher levels. I do believe that the last few percentage points going to be hard. But also, I think that they're going to be the most profitable points we bring in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS.\nAtul Maheswari: This is Atul Maheswari on from Tom Wadewitz. Robert, if I heard you right, did you say that you're expecting a full recovery in indirect channel market share as you exit 2025? So if you could please confirm that? And related to that, are you able to quantify what would be the revenue lift that we should expect for 2026 as you run rate the 2025 exit rate to all of next year?\nRobert D. Isom: Well, Tom, I'll start with the first with is just getting back to our historical share. As we exit 2025, we're on track to getting -- restoring our full indirect channel share. And what that means is that as we exit the year. So it's not embedded in the full year 2025 results. But as we move into 2026, I expect to see that come through. We talked last year about that representing $1.5 billion of revenue. There's a good chunk of that that's going to flow through, and we're really pleased with our performance getting back on track.\nAtul Maheswari: Okay. And then as my follow-up, just following up on some of the questions that have been asked already. But if we look at your profit margins, relative to your network peers, just it would seem based on the outlooks that all of you have provided this year that your margin gap even at the EBITDAR level is likely to widen this year. So really, as you look out over the next few years, what do you think American really needs to do to make progress in bridging this gap? And do you think there are any structural impediments to American actually fully bridging this gap over time?\nDevon E. May: Well, I'll just start with last year. At the end of last year, we had a 2-point EBITDA margin gap to United, inclusive of Delta's third- party business. We had about a 2-point EBITDA margin gap to them as well. And that's a gap that we expect to close over time. This year is an unusual year for all the reasons we discussed, and you have to probably dig a level deeper. One, we're -- we have a larger domestic exposure than either of our large network competitors. Two, we have -- we're just at different cycles with where we are at with collective bargaining agreements. We have all of ours in place. One of our competitors does not. So not everything is going to come through in margin in a linear fashion. But we do think over time, yes, we expect we can close that margin gap. We don't think there's anything structural. We had talked about what we think are some of the key reasons around it, inclusive of your first question, sales and distribution is something that was a headwind last year. It remains a headwind for us this year. But coming into next year, we think it will be a tailwind to margin. We've talked about our Citi agreement. There's been a gap to our peers there. We think we have an incredible partner and an incredible agreement in place, and we're going to close that gap over time as well. And we like a lot of the work that we're doing on the commercial side of the business, including some really nice investments in premium and premium customer, which we think will help as well. So there's a gap today. and there will be a gap this year, but we do expect to close it heading into 2026.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Shannon [indiscernible] on for Mike. So American recently agreed to drop its lawsuit against Chicago Aviation authorities. Where do you guys stand today? And what does it mean for your schedule later this year and early next year out of Chicago? Presumably, you thought you'd have more slots and not less than we have.\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks for the question. And regarding Chicago, this is a tremendous opportunity for American. We've been slowest to rebuild out of the pandemic our network for a number of reasons, largely because of pilot shortfalls in our regionals. But now that we have full ability to staff, we're in good shape. And so you'll see Chicago hit 485 peak departures, and we're on our way to producing even more than that, over 500 as we take a look into next year. We have the gate capacity we need to fulfill that growth and even more. And in terms of the status of the litigation, we feel really good about where we're at. We worked with the city to design and finance the expansion in Chicago. And all we're asking to do is have them live up to what they said they would do in terms of gate allocation. So we're not concerned. We've got what we need now, and we're going to have what we need going forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: And if I just may follow up, on the Embraer tariffs, we've heard that some airlines don't have to accept delivery of airplanes. Is that going to be the case with you and Embraer assuming that current tariff goes through?\nRobert D. Isom: Embraer is a terrific partner. And the E175s are just an exceptional aircraft with soon to be satellite-based WiFi and full first-class cabin. And so it fits really well. We're proud to be the operator of the world's largest fleet of Embraer aircraft, and that's unique to American. We're working with Embraer on deliveries, but we don't anticipate any long-term issues. As a matter of fact, we know that the Brazilian government is working with the administration and Embraer as well. And so over the long run, we know what's best. There's a tremendous amount of U.S.-based content on those Embraer aircraft, and there's a lot that goes into negotiating trade deals. So we stand by ready to help in any way, and we've made sure that the administration and Embraer knows our interest and we're confident we'll be taken care of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America.\nAndrew George Didora: So Robert, you've been speaking a lot about your revenue share in indirect channels. When I think about share more broadly, right, like your capacity growth has been trailing your network peers for the past 6 or so quarters. I guess as we move forward from here, are you content with growing less than your peers and driving that RASM outperformance that you've been getting? Or does there come a time when share matters and you need to maybe at least grow in line with some of your primary competition? Any thoughts around that?\nRobert D. Isom: Sure. It's always a balance. And it's something that we're going to make sure that we have a network that takes care of our customers in a way that they -- we need to serve them and that we can do so profitably over the long run. We're super pleased with the hub network that we're fortunate to have. Our hubs are based in the metro areas that are growing the fastest in the United States. You've seen from some of our recent announcements about the new terminal F in DFW. It's going to allow DFW to be the world's largest hub. We're confident that our hubs will support more growth. And specifically, as we look into 2026, you're going to see us make sure that we restore our share in Chicago. You're going to see us continue to build Philadelphia, which has been really a bright spot. And you'll also see us continue to invest in Miami. All that goes with a tremendous domestic network that is ultimately the anchor to help support international growth. And our fleet is going to allow for more of that. And I like the opportunity we have to play both in the international market and premium space as well. So good things on the horizon from that perspective. We're going to take care of our customers.\nAndrew George Didora: Got it. And just my second question here. I know you've spoken about kind of your corporate revenues growing 10% in a flattish market. I guess -- can you more quantify the demand improvement you've seen of late that just gives you the confidence to speak to the accelerating revenue growth despite the tougher comps as we head into the back half of the year?\nRobert D. Isom: Yes. It's just booking trends, and it's especially what we see coming from June moving into July. And then as you move into August and September, we feel really confident in terms of an improving capacity and supply environment and American benefits, and we should benefit more than others given our exposure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line David Vernon of Bernstein.\nDavid Scott Vernon: So Robert, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the investment in sort of the customer experience. And I want to ask it in kind of two ways. One, first, kind of as you look at yourself relative to your peers, where are the big opportunities for you to improve the customer experience? And as you talk to investors about this, like how are you thinking about measuring this? Is it Net Promoter Scores? How are you going to kind of judge the performance on improving the overall customer experience? Obviously, it will eventually show up in the bottom line. But I'm just wondering how are you thinking about talking about your progress on this journey to improve with investors and analysts?\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks, David. Appreciate the question. First off, we're going to measure this by our customers' perception and by revenue performance, okay? So first off, we will evaluate our Net Promoter Scores. That will be a huge driver. And as well in terms of revenue performance, this is going to be -- we're doing this to improve premium revenues and revenue overall. So unit revenues will be the metric that we take a look at. And so in terms of where we're at, we've had a long history of first in terms of customer experience enhancements and improvements, and we're building on that. So whether it's the new flagship suites on our 787s, which will soon be on our 321 XLRs, which then will also be on our 777-300s that are being reconfigured. That all plays into that our premium lounge network, which is larger than anyone else. You heard our Philadelphia announcement, Miami, and there will be more on that. A lot of that is built into the capital spending that we've already planned. So I would suggest that there's not a lot of catch-up on that front. You will see us invest in our food and in-flight amenities. And again, you will see us continue to avoid -- to invest in the premium experience. Where I look at opportunities going forward, though, it really is the ability to serve that premium customer, especially internationally as well. And we have a fleet that is ideally suited to do that. So those adjustments that I described, they're all going to result in the ability to serve almost 50% more premium customers in premium seating as we move out into 2030. And from an international perspective, our fleet is going to allow us to serve more or actually improve flying by almost 50% or more than 50% as we move out into 2030.\nDavid Scott Vernon: And I guess as you think about kind of where you guys stand relative to peers in terms of Net Promoter -- or do you guys benchmark that at all?\nRobert D. Isom: We do. And we think it's a great opportunity. It's something, again, that is on a front that we take very seriously. It starts with running an exceptional operation. And we've been hit with our share of challenging operating conditions this summer, certainly in June and July, no place has been hit, no airline has been hit as hard as American. So it starts with running a reliable operation. We're making sure that we can recover as quickly as possible, investing in technology on that front. And then moving from there, it really is making sure that we have the basics and those things that are just essential for competition. And then there are some things that you're going to see us play in that we'll look to even outpace the competition. And on that front, it's all designed to improve our customer experience and revenue performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.\nDuane Thomas Pfennigwerth: So depending upon how we interpret the guide for 3Q, maybe there's slight sequential improvement in RASM depending upon how the quarter plays out. But I wonder how would you rank your enthusiasm for sequential improvement by entity, maybe domestic versus Atlantic versus Latin? And do you see a path back to positive RASM for domestic this year?\nDevon E. May: Duane, I'll just say this about the environment right now in Q3 versus Q2. In the third quarter, domestic is going to be better, but it starts with a month of July that's going to look very similar to what we had in the second quarter. But we do expect improvement beyond that point, and that's actually the entity where we expect to see the most improvement. Transatlantic, we had outstanding performance in the second quarter. As the Iran conflict was heating up, that was during a pretty decent booking window for Q3. So we do expect a little bit softer performance in the Transatlantic in July and August. But by September, we think it's going to be performing really nicely again. The rest of the network, I think there's probably some pressure in short-haul Latin, long-haul, Latin and Transpacific will probably perform pretty similarly to what we saw in Q2. But when we look at it in totality, we really like the environment that we're in now versus where we were a couple of months ago. And especially as we get to the back end of this quarter, we think there's some really nice potential for positive unit revenue ahead. That's not baked into the guide. Obviously, we're going to have negative unit revenue this quarter at the midpoint. But we do think as we head out to the fourth quarter, there is potential for positive unit revenue performance.\nDuane Thomas Pfennigwerth: And then I may have missed it, apologies if I did, but you guys have been pretty good at keeping your capacity in kind of this 3% range, basically for all the quarters of this year, you made some comments about early deliveries. Does that change the trajectory for the fourth quarter? Or do you lean harder on retirements? Or is it just a rounding error?\nDevon E. May: There may be a little bit more capacity that comes in, in the fourth quarter with deliveries. It's not going to be a huge amount, though. Just on retirements, I think you may be aware, we don't have any aircraft retirements that are necessary between now and the end of the decade. So for us, when we're managing capacity, it's really just being tight around utilization during the off-peak periods. And I think we were pretty quick to react here in the third quarter, at least for -- these periods like August and September, which are traditionally lower demand periods. As we head into the fourth quarter, though, we like the demand trends we're seeing, and I think we're going to put the right amount of supply in the market to meet that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James.\nSavanthi Nipunika Prelis-Syth: Just a clarification there, sorry. So on the domestic capacity side, with the declines, is that solely related to just taking off-peak capacity out. So as you get into the fourth quarter, you'll see that step up again? Is that how you're thinking?\nDevon E. May: Well, I'll just say fourth quarter capacity isn't finalized yet. But yes, in the third quarter, like we would in a normal year, we pulled capacity down in August and September. This year, just given the trends we have been seeing in demand as we went into the second quarter, we pulled August and September down more than we normally would. Some of that capacity would naturally come back in the fourth quarter, which is traditional seasonality, and that's what I would expect again this year.\nSavanthi Nipunika Prelis-Syth: Makes sense. And then on the operations front, it seemed like that was one area that you had really improved kind of versus where you were maybe pre-pandemic over the last few years of this year, clearly, more issues. And I wonder if you can kind of -- is it really down to DCA and weather? And if that's the case, I mean, weather might not change. Like how do you manage through this? Because it seems like the metrics have gotten worse at American versus peers, even though you are kind of recovering better.\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks, Savi. Look, I think American runs the most reliable, safe operation possible at all times. I'm really proud of our team and the way they've been able to recover. Let's just go through some of the things that we've dealt with. First off, June saw regular operations up 35% plus over the prior couple of years. And just go ahead and multiply that by 2 or 3x as we moved into July. I said earlier today on another call that -- we've had almost 800 diversion events and 5,500-plus weather cancellations just in the first 3 weeks of July. Now that is not something -- that is something that will continue long into the future. It's an anomaly. And we've seen that now that heat has kind of come back into the summer and we're more in a normal cycle. We're going to make sure, though, that we do the things that make American as resilient as possible. And so whether that's investing in a little bit in the schedule to create some redundancy, extra resources, technology, we're putting AI to use to make sure that we have the best recovery plans and options for our customers out there. So I feel good about our ability to manage through we do need investment in air traffic control. One of the issues that we're facing today is it's unique to us is a slowdown out of DCA. We had the aircraft incident earlier in the year. And -- but I fully expect that we will recover from that, and that will no longer be an impediment. So over the long run, I think that weather normalizes for everyone. I think that American, because of what we do and how we've operated during a really difficult environment, we're going to shine over the long run. And I feel really good about that. So a couple of other proof points. One is that even with these irregular operations, our mishandled baggage rates are improving very, very, very much. And I know that we're doing a great job in getting customers back online when operational events create problems. So there you have it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Fitzgerald of TD Cowen.\nThomas John Fitzgerald: Most of might have already been answered, but I'm curious just how you're thinking about the New York market organically now that seemingly a lot of the inorganic growth options there have been closed off.\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks, Tom. We have a great franchise in New York. We're the third largest carrier with over 260 peak day departures across all 3 airports. Our largest operation is at the preferred New York Airport, LaGuardia, and we have 150 departures there. The new terminal is great. It does come at significant expense, but we're optimizing our network to adjust to make sure we can take New Yorkers to where they want to go and customers that want to go to New York, we're making sure that we have the ability to do that. And so based on what we're doing, we're seeing margin expansion year-over-year. And our oneworld hub at JFK Terminal 8, which I think is really unique to American. We offer a seamless experience with 125 peak day departures across AA and our partners. We've got a great product, especially from a transcon perspective, London Heathrow to New York, the biggest business market in the world. Yes, our New York is more specialized given our network and complements where we're strong in so many other places. But we have the ability to grow as well. And that growth can be through upgauging, and we're always making sure that we're flying to the right places.\nThomas John Fitzgerald: Okay. That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, how -- I don't know if you're able to give us any like sizing or like in terms of like points of RASM, but how are you thinking about, I guess, headwinds from the WiFi for next year and then -- and tailwinds from the improving mix as you take on more premium heavy fleet?\nRobert D. Isom: Okay. So I'll start with that. And Devon, you can pitch in. Regarding satellite WiFi, that's -- it's going to be fantastic. American will be the first carrier to really offer satellite-based WiFi across its entire mainline fleet and everything but our 50 seaters from a regional basis. Those installations are going on and doing very well. We have a wonderful partnership with our satellite WiFi being sponsored by AT&T. That offers a tremendous opportunity for both companies to take care of our customers in the way that they want and find ways to serve them even better. So from that perspective, I believe that based on our partnerships and what we think in terms of consumer sentiment and also usage of the service. I think that we're going to do pretty well, and you won't see much of an impact in terms of the P&L. And in terms -- and I spoke earlier about the work that we're doing from a premium product perspective. We've got a fantastic foundation. And whether it's our facilities, our lounges, the aircraft that we're coming in that are already built into our capital plan, yes, we're going to augment that a little bit with amenities and service and we'll do that, but that won't have a material impact either.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: I guess on New York, I was curious what you all made of the United-JetBlue arrangement. How compelling do you think that will be? And how much of a step back is it that American wasn't able to come to some other agreement with JetBlue?\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks, Ali. Look, we had a creative relationship with JetBlue for a number of years that really benefit customers. Unfortunately, we couldn't maintain that long into the future. And so we haven't had the benefit of that for a couple of years now. We -- as I mentioned before, we like our New York franchise. It's specialized, but it's centered on those things that really, I think, are most meaningful, not only to our network, but our customers, transcon and international service and really taking New Yorkers where they want to go and making sure that we have a great schedule from all of our hubs into the New York region as well. New York is one of the places that we've grown. Our AAdvantage enrollments actually even at a faster clip than we have in the last couple of years. So we know that we have a fantastic customer base there. And we'll look for ways to serve them. We have the ability to do some growth ourselves through upgauging. We've got our partner network in our oneworld hub in JFK T8. So I feel really confident about how we're set up and where we're headed going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Just curious if you could talk a little bit more about this weakness you've been seeing with the consumer. Robert, I know that you mentioned the uncertainty going into July. What is that exactly? And what are the signs of that? And just because it differs a bit from what we heard from Delta and American. Sorry, Delta and United.\nRobert D. Isom: Well, I think that differs from what we've said as well. So the uncertainty that is in July is really due to bookings that were made in the second quarter. As we move from June into July, we're seeing the same uptick in bookings that anybody else is seeing. It's been remarkable, and it's something that gives us great confidence as we look into August and September and the third quarter and the early bookings, we only have 20% of revenue on the books for the fourth quarter. But as we look out into the fourth quarter, it all looks very promising. That benefits us because it's largely domestic rebound. And so given our exposure domestically, I think that, that bodes very well. Now in terms of the drivers of the reduction in uncertainty, I think that comes from more stability, tax bill. I think it comes from tariff deals being done with the U.K. recently announced Japan, hopefully something with the EU soon. So all of that bodes well for the consumer. Joblessness is trending in the right direction. While GDP has been pulled down a little bit, it's still positive for the back half of the year. And I think that, that all lends to a customer that's more willing to get out there and spend travel and do some things that they want to do.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. And just one follow-up. One of your competitors was talking about using AI more for pricing. How do you think about that? And is that something that you're considering or already experimenting with?\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks. And I appreciate the question because I, quite frankly, think that some of the things I've heard are just not good. For American, we will use AI to improve our ability to operate the airline. We're going to be more efficient because of it. We're going to be able to -- our team members are going to have an easier time of doing their jobs. For our customers, it's going to improve their customer experience. We're going to be able to give them the ability to see more of the amenities that we can offer. We're going to be able to serve them in a way that when they do run into difficulties that they can recover faster. We have projects underway now that are all aligned in that fashion. We talked about operational difficulties. One of the big AI investments we've made is in a project that we call HEAT that allows us to rebuild the operation as quickly as possible going forward. So for us, of course, we're going to find ways to get our product in front of consumers. But consumers need to know that they can trust American, okay? This is not about bait and switch. This is not about tricking and others that talk about using AI in that way, I don't think it's appropriate. And certainly, from American, it's not something we will do.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?\nRobert D. Isom: Thanks, Latif, and thank you to everybody on the call today. We remain confident that the actions that we've taken to deliver on our revenue potential, strengthen our network, operate with excellence and find ways to drive efficiencies throughout the airline position us well for the long term. I want to thank you for joining us, and thank you for your support and interest. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. I would now like to hand the call over to Gabriel Jackson, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGabriel Jackson: Thank you, Latif. Good morning, and welcome to the American Airlines Group First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with prepared remarks, we have our CEO, Robert Isom, and our CFO, Devon May. In addition to our Vice Chair, Steve Johnson, we have a number of our senior executives in the room this morning for the Q&A session. Robert will follow up with an overview of our performance, and Devon will follow with details on the first quarter in addition to outlining our operating plan and outlook going forward. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Before we begin today, we must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenue, cost, forecast of capacity, and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning as well as our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information we are giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Good morning, everyone. It goes without saying that we're in a challenging economic environment which has had a significant impact on the industry. Historically, the airline industry has done well in periods of economic growth and certainty. The industry exited the fourth quarter with positive momentum, but this quickly shifted during the first quarter. The economic uncertainty in the market has pressured demand and impacted American Airlines Group's first quarter results and second quarter outlook. Given this macro environment, we're withdrawing our full-year outlook. That said, if current demand trends continue, we expect to deliver a profitable year and produce positive free cash flow. At American Airlines Group, we have the foundational strength, resilience, team, and financial and operating flexibility to navigate the current environment. The work we have done the past several years has prepared us for times like these. We completed our fleet renewal in a very different economic environment with lower aircraft costs, lower lease and interest rates, and during a time of OEM and supply chain stability. As a result, we have low aircraft CapEx requirements for the remainder of the decade. We continue to employ our best-in-class cost management to make the airline more efficient. Through our efforts to reengineer the business, we now expect more than $750 million of cumulative cost savings as we exit 2025. We've utilized our free cash flow to strengthen the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had our lowest net debt level since the end of 2015, while simultaneously taking action to smooth our debt maturity obligations going forward. This foundation allows us to focus on our 2025 priorities of running a reliable operation as we reestablish connectivity throughout our network and continue to find ways to run a more efficient airline. We're taking action to deliver on our revenue potential, enhancing our partnership with Citi, growing our Advantage loyalty program, progressing in our sales and distribution indirect channel recovery, and renewing our focus on customer experience to provide the best product and service for everyone who flies with American Airlines Group. As we move forward, we remain committed to delivering on our long-term growing margins, generating sustainable free cash flow, and further strengthening our balance sheet. Now onto our first quarter performance. First quarter unit revenue was up 0.7% year over year, which continues to lead the industry, despite more exposure to a challenging domestic environment. We estimate the impact of American Eagle flight 5342 reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $200 million. Long-haul international passenger RASM continued to lead the way in the first quarter. Atlantic passenger RASM was up 10.5% year over year, and Pacific passenger RASM was up 4.9% on 24.1% more capacity, primarily driven by strength in Japan. Short-haul Latin passenger RASM increased year over year for the first time in more than a year and remains one of the most profitable regions on an absolute basis. We continue to see strong demand for international travel from the US. Domestic passenger RASM was down 0.7% year over year in the quarter as US consumer discretionary spending, especially consumer spending on air travel, decelerated throughout the quarter. Performance in our premium and loyalty revenues continued to show strength year over year. Premium revenue increased 3% year over year in the first quarter on 0.3% lower capacity. Our premium cabin RASM year over year outperformed main cabin RASM by four points in domestic and eight points in international. Paid load factor in our premium cabins remained historically high and was up 2.9 points year over year. Loyalty revenues were up 5% year over year, with spending on our co-branded credit cards up 8% in the quarter. We've begun laying the foundation for our expanded co-branded credit card partnership with Citi, which is set to begin in 2026, and we remain on track to achieve the long-term growth targets we outlined last year. Most importantly, customers continue to recognize the value of our loyalty program, with Advantage enrollments increasing 6% year over year. Advantage members are responsible for 76% of premium cabin revenue. American Airlines Group is proud to have an industry-leading travel rewards program that is frequently recognized for providing the best value for its members. Despite the headwinds in the economy and lower capacity, managed business revenue was up 8% year over year in the first quarter. We remain encouraged by the feedback we're receiving from corporate customers as we continue to engage with them to understand how best to meet their needs. We saw specific strength in the financial and professional services sectors during the quarter. Momentum in recovering revenue from indirect channels continued in the first quarter. We hit our target of reducing the gap versus our historical share to 7% in the first quarter, and we forecast to gain back another two points in the second quarter. We remain on track to restore our revenue share from indirect channels to historical levels as we exit this year. Despite the current macroeconomic uncertainty, we started the year with a conservative growth plan, and we will continue to be mindful of our capacity deployment. The demand and the competitive environments will continue to serve as the guidepost for our future capacity plans. We'll remain nimble and take action as conditions warrant, and we have many levers at our disposal, such as reducing off-peak flying or, if circumstances require, returning leased aircraft, retiring aircraft, and deferring aircraft deliveries to efficiently reduce capacity without jeopardizing the quality of our core network. We're positioning American Airlines Group for sustained long-term success, and a big part of that is transforming our customers' experience and engagement with us. We've established a new customer experience organization, a centralized cohesive team that sits at the intersection of our commercial and operations organizations. This team will advocate on behalf of customers, leading the strategy and implementation of initiatives to improve every part of the customer journey, from bookings to the airport to in-flight experience to customer feedback. Last week, we announced that Advantage members will receive complimentary high-speed satellite Wi-Fi beginning in January 2026, thanks to a new sponsorship with AT&T. We're excited to be able to offer free high-speed satellite Wi-Fi on more aircraft than any other carrier, and it's a great way to demonstrate that we have renewed our focus on the customer experience. American Airlines Group continues to have the youngest fleet of the US network carriers. We're excited to debut our new state-of-the-art flagship suite seat on our first new Boeing 787-9, and we look forward to the rollout of this product on our new Airbus A321XLR aircraft. These deliveries, along with the planned refresh of existing seats, are expected to grow American Airlines Group's lie-flat and premium economy seating by approximately 50% by the end of the decade. Additionally, American Airlines Group has led the way in introducing premium lounges and offers more premium lounges than any other US network carrier. We're committed to reinvigorating the customer experience throughout various touchpoints to the travel journey, and we're on track to open our newest flagship lounge in Philadelphia in May. This lounge will be our ninth premium lounge across the system, with more to come. Finally, we recently announced several changes to improve our boarding process starting next month, and just this week, we introduced a new redesigned mobile app to further enhance customer interactions and self-service options. Turning now to our operation. During the first quarter, the American Airlines Group team demonstrated our resilience and ability to quickly recover from irregular operations. We continue to make investments to drive further enhancements to our operating reliability. Our first quarter operation was impacted by California wildfires, increased winter weather in our Sunbelt hubs, and the tragic accident of flight 5342 on January 29th. Before moving on, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tragedy and pay tribute to the lives lost in the accident. We're supporting the families and loved ones through our Office of Continued Care and Outreach, which we established within a week of the accident. The role and responsibilities of the office will evolve over time, but it will always be focused on ensuring we live out our purpose of caring for people on life's journey. Thank you to our team members who helped in the immediate response to those who kept the operation running while caring for our customers, and to our care team members who supported the families. We continue to work closely with the US government, and we're encouraged by the collective commitment to make the US aviation system even safer going forward. Now I'll turn the call over to Devon to share more about our first quarter financial results and second quarter outlook.\nDevon May: Thank you, Robert. This morning, American Airlines Group reported a first quarter GAAP net loss of $473 million. Excluding special items, we reported a first quarter net loss of $386 million, an adjusted loss of $0.59 per diluted share. We produced first quarter revenue of $12.6 billion, down 0.2% year over year, with unit revenue up 0.7% year over year. First quarter unit cost excluding fuel and net special items was up 7.8% year over year. We are committed to running the airline as efficiently as possible while enhancing the customer experience. Through best-in-class workforce management, efficient asset utilization, and procurement transformation, we now expect to achieve approximately $250 million of cost savings in 2025, on top of the $500 million achieved last year. We also expect an additional $100 million of working capital cash release, bringing our total improvement in working capital to approximately $550 million over the past three years. We continue to see improvements in the productivity of our team and expect mainline full-time employee accounts to stay approximately flat relative to 2024. With regard to our fleet, we expect to take delivery of 40 to 50 new aircraft this year. Based on our current expectations for new deliveries, our 2025 aircraft CapEx, which also includes used aircraft purchases, spare engines, and net PDPs, is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, and our total CapEx is expected to be between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. We continue to expect moderate levels of CapEx moving forward, with aircraft CapEx averaging approximately $3.5 billion for the remainder of the decade. We ended the first quarter with $10.8 billion of total available liquidity, and we produced free cash flow of $1.7 billion in the quarter. During the quarter, we strategically repriced our $2.3 billion Advantage-backed term loan. The repricing lowered the interest rate by nearly 300 basis points and vastly improved the amortization profile, pushing out $1.9 billion of amortization over the next three years into 2028. Additionally, we reduced total debt by $1.2 billion during the quarter. We now have more than $10 billion in unencumbered assets and more than $13 billion in additional first lien borrowing capacity. Our balance sheet is stronger than it has been in nearly a decade, and we remain committed to reducing our total debt to less than $35 billion by year-end 2027. For the second quarter of 2025, we expect capacity to be up 2% to 4% year over year as we continue to build back our northern hubs. We remain focused on deploying profitable capacity and being nimble in response to the demand and competitive environment. We expect second quarter revenue to be down 2% to up 1% year over year as we anticipate softness in the domestic main cabin to continue. To partially offset this, we expect long-haul international and premium bookings to outperform year over year and anticipate additional progress in recovering revenue through our indirect channels. Second quarter non-fuel unit cost is expected to be up 3% to 5% year over year, which is in line with our expectations to start the year. Nearly the entirety of our year-over-year CASM ex increase is driven by the collective bargaining agreements that we have ratified over the past two years. While these collective bargaining agreements have resulted in a meaningful step-up in labor costs, we are pleased that all of our largest work groups enjoy contracts that are in line with industry-leading agreements and that we have labor cost certainty through 2027. Based on our current demand assumptions and fuel price forecast, we expect to produce second quarter earnings of approximately $0.50 to $1.00 per diluted share. I'll now turn the call back to Robert for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Thank you, Devon. The travel industry is a critical engine for the US economy, generating $1.3 trillion in direct spending in the US and supporting one in every eleven US jobs. With increased global travel to the US comes increased spending and investment in economic growth. Airlines are a big part of that equation, and American Airlines Group is proud to be the largest employer of US workers among them. Anything that spurs demand for travel, both domestically and abroad, is something we will support. This starts with making America a welcoming destination for international travelers, especially in advance of major events like the FIFA World Cup 2026, of which we're a sponsor, and later, the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. This means expanding Visa-free travel, lowering Visa processing times, and expediting the deployment of new technologies to make travel more seamless and secure. And, of course, ensuring the growth and long-term health of the travel industry in the US will require us to address critical infrastructure issues, the most pressing of which is ATC modernization. American Airlines Group is committed to working with the administration, regulators, and the rest of the industry to meet each of these challenges. At American Airlines Group, we're resilient by design. The underlying strength of our business and balance sheet and our ability to remain nimble and adjust to the environment gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the path forward. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments and producing results for the airline and for our shareholders. Operator, you may now open the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: You will be limited to one question and one follow-up. Please standby while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of David Scott Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead, David.\nDavid Scott Vernon: Good morning, guys. Robert, so I guess the first question I have for you is the earnings release and materials didn't make much mention around sort of capacity moderation given the weakness that we're seeing in demand. Can you talk about kind of how you're thinking about sizing the network as we get through the second half of the year?\nRobert Isom: Mean, clearly, with the financial leverage of the business, you know, I'm sure this is something you guys are looking at. It just like to hear from you kinda what you're thinking about on the capacity front as we look at two h.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, David. Appreciate the question. What we've done is obviously pulled our guidance. We've we more or less have our capacity plan set, for the summer. We plan on on flying that. You saw in our in our second quarter guide, two to four percent growth. We look beyond that, there's a lot of uncertainty Our view as as we go forward is we're gonna be nimble and quick to react. Size demand sized capacity to to demand But I'll tell you right now, we have a negative bias to all capacity as we go forward. We'll know more you know, as as as time develops in the the next several weeks, month, and we'll have more to talk about on that on future earnings calls.\nDavid Scott Vernon: Alright. May maybe just as a follow-up, as you think about the the corporate, sort of share recovery, is that coming in at the yields you would have expected to be coming in? Or is there a little bit of reinvestment required in terms of of recapturing some of that, the business share. Yeah. Thanks for the question. This is Steve.\nSteve Johnson: It's it's coming in just as we expected. And as Robert said in his opening remarks, we're on track to recover share by the end of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James. Please go ahead, Savi.\nSavi Syth: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I know you mentioned it sounds like in 2Q, you're expecting kind of international in premium to continue leading the way. But I was curious if you can provide a little bit more color across the four entities on on how you you know, what's in guidance in terms of performance there?\nSteve Johnson: Sure. Thanks, Alek. It's a across the entities. We're seeing strength through the summer. Really, in each one. Obviously, with with the uncertainty and and just the booking curve visibility beyond the summer's a little unclear right now, but we're seeing really, you know, very good strength in our Heathrow and Europe operation. Strength in the North Pacific, strength in the South Pacific, you know, South America to South America, but it it is doing pretty well. And Argentina is kind of the star of the show down there right now. And it also you know, just don't wanna finish the answer without mentioning that you you know our we're still continue we have a very significant international operation in its short haul in the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and that's performing pretty well.\nSavi Syth: I appreciate that. And if I could on the domestic side, are you expecting much of a deceleration or or, you know, what's the trend into 2Q there?\nSteve Johnson: Domestically, you know, we remain strong in in as we described in the opening remarks, our premium bookings are terrific. Our the bookings through indirect channels are solid. Our business bookings are solid. What we're seeing, though, like the other airlines, airlines, is, you know, really significant weakness in the demand that books through our indirect channels, which is, you know, I think we believe is mostly our most price sensitive customers, our customers for whom travel is most discretionary, And, you know, that's that's where the the issue is. You know, we'd like to think that that's demand that's not been lost, but demand that's on the sidelines waiting to, understand which direction the economy is gonna go. But, nevertheless, at at the moment, that's that we're seeing weakness in those in those cohorts.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Scott.\nScott Group: K. Thanks. So just to follow-up there, that that subset of the business that you're talking about that's I guess, maybe domestic, main cabin, or indirect. What percentage of the of the total business is that end I if international is staying it sounds like international is positive. If know, correct me if I'm wrong. Like,\nSteve Johnson: Right.\nScott Group: are we seeing is this business down? Is this a high down, high single digit kind of RASM right now? On this more domestic main cabin part of the business?\nSteve Johnson: Domestic main cabin is weak, and that's what's driving, I think, the the overall demand numbers that you're seeing and the and the weakness in the in the in the the reports. Right? I think I I'd say mid to high single digit weakness in those groups particularly over the course of the summer is what we're looking at.\nScott Group: Okay. And then I guess are we seeing any signs of that stabilize or is it continuing to get worse? And then maybe just, like, bigger pick you a year ago in q two, I you guys do underperformed on RASM and we heard about well, we lost a lot of corporate We're now getting the corporate back. Why aren't we seeing the RASM benefit of that at least relative to some of the others?\nRobert Isom: Hey, Scott. I just let me let me start with this, which is look. There's a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the environment. We take a look at fourth quarter, tremendous amount of momentum. You go into the first quarter. January kinda came in where we had anticipated. February looked kinda kinda solid. But, really, March and then continuing to April, you know, changed considerably. So we're cautious about what we're looking at in terms of of forecast for second quarter. Because there is so so much uncertainty. And it's why we pulled the our guide beyond that So as we take a look and as Steve mentioned, premium is doing well. International We're winning back our sales in in in from a sales and distribution perspective. We just don't have a lot of clarity what goes beyond that. And even as we take a look in to to the summer, what we know right now, we're telling you the best what we know and, you know, we're gonna have to see how things play out.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Connor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead, Connor.\nConnor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just going back to the US domestic market, I I realize this is a short term question and I hate to ask it, but can you talk about how you've changed your revenue management systems? Are you doing what Delta and United are doing essentially in opening up basic economy earlier? And the question the reason why I asked that is, like, the industry in general has a lot more seats to sell in June versus April. So are you seeing incremental discounting into a month like that relative general? Thank you.\nSteve Johnson: Sure. Thanks for the question. I I well, I I don't have specifics about how Delta and United have set up, but we believe that we are properly set up for a summer that is, you know, along the lines that I just described a moment ago where there's, you know, significant weakness in our main cabin demand, significant weakness among our most discretionary travelers, So our inventory systems and our pricing is set up to accommodate that, to capture you know, all of the demand that is available, under the existing circumstances. And, obviously, those are levers that we can pull and tweak and and and manage very carefully a real time basis. We're monitoring the system the situation, you know, very carefully, make changes every day. But I think right now, our our our setup is is where it needs to be.\nConnor Cunningham: Okay.\nSteve Johnson: Okay. And then, you know, you know, I'd spent a lot of time on their call talking about share shift\nConnor Cunningham: in Chicago. And, you know, I'm just trying to understand from your corporate\nSteve Johnson: travel expectation as you exit this year.\nConnor Cunningham: Like, can you talk about the importance of rebuilding New York\nSteve Johnson: in Chicago in general and, you know, how that correlates to to these getting back the the corporate share that you lost from the distribution changes in general. Thank you.\nSteve Johnson: Sure. Sure. A a a big complicated question, but let me try to unpack it. First first, if United is gaining share in Chicago, they're gaining it from somebody other than us. So let's start there. But and might as well just stick with Chicago. I mean, it's a it's a huge market. It's a huge business. Market. It's, you know, our third largest hub. It's a really key part of our network. It has been, you know, profitable in the past. Even as a shared hub. And, you know, we've been part of Chicago for ninety nine years. We have a really loyal customer base there. We have significant advantage penetration, significant co brand penetration. We've received a really positive reception from our corporate clients as we you know, pivoted on sales and distribution. Chicago's really important to them, and our presence there is really important to our business with them. Geographically, Chicago is important. It's where, you know, we we it's how we take care of and connect to and and provide service to our customers in the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes region. It's how we connect passengers across the northern tier of the United States. And I can also say that that that so far, the Chicago so far, we have increased our share in Chicago, and the overall performance is I think, going exactly in accordance with our plans. New York is New York is is is likewise a, you know, very important part of our network very large market, a market that has always accommodated several airlines. We in New York, we have a large customer and large and loyal customer base. Significant advantage penetration, significant co brand penetration. And we're we're excited about the evolving position that we're that we're creating in New York. Lagarde will be, you know, the largest, I think, operation that we've had in history. We've optimized it, we think, for our New York customers. We've optimized it for our hubs and spokes, and we've optimized it to maximize the the the halo effect that that New York has. At JFK, we've created a really competitive one world hub at t eight in at the airport there. And together with LaGuardia, we and together with our JB partners, we now serve a hundred markets out of New York. We have a know, really significant franchise in the transcontinental market, really significant franchise in London Heathrow, the biggest travel market in the world, I think. And we operate at a really at a two really great facilities in New York with terrific lounge products, terrific retail. Indeed, we're we still we're reimagining the retail at JFK, and I'm told there there's gonna be sixty new stores and restaurants there as that work is completed. So I we're evolving in New York. We're adapting in New York. We're obviously constrained in New York by spots, but we're, I think, really happy with positioning we have there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. First one for Devin. So you know, you're obviously not buying back stock at the moment, which is, you know, a a a good thing. But curious how we should think about your approach to minimum liquidity and capex if operating cash flow deteriorates from here. So which which, you know, bucket or buckets, plural, of collateral would you consider easiest to tap given where market yields are right now?\nDevon May: Yeah. Well, I'll I'll just start by saying I really like the position we're in. You know, we ended the first quarter with ten point eight billion dollars of liquidity. We have made a ton of progress on the balance sheet. We've reduced total debt by fifteen billion dollars from peak levels back in mid twenty twenty one. We have billion dollars of unencumbered assets. We have thirteen billion dollars of first lien capacity. You know, we have really high quality first lien capacity. It's it's out there as well, whether it's, you know, slot gates routes or Mhmm. Advantage backed. We we feel really good about where we're at right now and know, we'll see what we end up doing with it if we do really get into a downside scenario, but we're we're in a great position.\nJamie Baker: Okay. And then following on Connor's question, and it wouldn't be an American earnings call, I suppose, if I didn't ask about one of your hubs. But looking at, Chicago, it it seems that a pretty material portion of the capacity restoration is really early in the morning or pretty late at night. I Can you comment on how RASM you know, sort of at the edges of the workday, however you define that, compares to that of I don't know. Daylight hours for lack of a better term. Although, I suppose that's not a good term for the summer. But you get the idea. Yeah.\nSteve Johnson: Sure, Jamie. I mean, as you grow markets, you you particularly hub markets, you you grow them by adding banks. And so we've added banks at the beginning of the day and the end of the day. There's There's obviously, those are those are gonna be weaker than in the heart of the day. But but they it's cheaper to add those by just improving your asset utilization. Also, it's important to know that, you know, the first slide of the day and the last slide of the day is really important. And so as we think about what we where we wanna end up and Chicago, that's that that's a big step, and, you know, ultimately, those we expect that those banks will improve performance as you know, we have the opportunity to to fly them and have the our customers get more remember American and and those will those will be better. Really important part of our local traffic offering for our Chicagoans is the banks are the first part of the day, and the banks for the last part of the day. So, yeah, they're that's that's what we had always planned and what you would have expected to see.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dwayne Fenigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, Dwayne.\nDwayne Fenigwerth: Hey. Hey. Thanks. Appreciate the time. Just just on the corporate share recapture, it's hard to find that in your guidance and understand it's a it's a dynamic back drop for sure. But you know, what would be offsetting this share recapture if you're winning back corporates?\nSteve Johnson: From a margin and from a, I guess, implied, you know, RASM perspective. Thanks. I I think that you're not seeing it because it's it's overwhelmed by the weakness in our main cabin demand.\nRobert Isom: And, Steve, I'd I'd add to that. Our government business is Yeah. Is falling off considerably as well. So that would add to it as well.\nDwayne Fenigwerth: Okay. And then apologies. I I really don't wanna ask another Chicago question, but I'll but I'll I'll venture down the path. Again, it might be hard to parse in this backdrop But can you contrast, you know, presumably, some of this was about taking pressure off of a market like Charlotte versus the investment that you're making in a market like Chicago, can you just you know, help us size you know, the the relative benefit in Charlotte from a RASM and margin perspective versus, you know, the relative investment in Chicago. And I guess, when are we done? What what inning are we in of that rebuild in Chicago? Thank you. A baseball question again. What what the what inning are we in in the rebuild of Chicago? It's right now, like, maybe the fourth inning, I think, is about right. Fourth or fifth inning, something like that. And our strategy to grow Chicago didn't have anything to do with our strategy in Charlotte. You know? It Chicago was a place that that is a place that we have been very successful in the past. We took down our Chicago operation during the pandemic. As we we grew our operation after the pandemic, we deployed our assets in the places where demand was the strongest first. Chicago just, you know, was slower to to rebound. But now we're focused on rebuilding the position that we've traditionally had in Chicago. We understand that we'll probably always be second place in Chicago, but that's been you know, a very effective, and it means to serve our customers. Profitable, and a a a position that we like a lot. So that's what we're focused on is rebuilding Chicago. Because Chicago is a really important part of our network, not in Charlotte, you know, we've our our strategy there is to continue to be as large in Charlotte as we can operate. It's a, you know, very efficient, very geographically well placed hub. Very low cost for for purposes of connecting, but, we are, you know, close to capacity at that airport. And so we're just not in a position at least right now to grow it any further.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Catherine.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Just one more on the 2Q revenue guidance, if you allow it. Steve, I think you were talking about you're expecting to see momentum in in international through the summer. That's looking strong, often with that being cabin. So I guess underlying your revenue guidance, are you expecting each international geography to see PRASM improve relative to its one q performance and and the desal is all domestic or or have I got that scrambled?\nSteve Johnson: The I I I think what we are seeing is solid performance in the long haul international markets that is you know, improved year over year. It's hard to I think, to compare second quarter performance to first quarter performance because, you know, the demand's so different. But I would just say sequentially strong. It's still positive. If you if what you're asking is is the year over year growth in the second quarter as good as the year over year growth in the first quarter. I'd say it's decelerating a little bit, but still strong and, again, fueled by really strong premium demand, really strong demand for the premium cabins.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Thanks. And and maybe one for Devin. You guys understandably pulled for your EPS in this very uncertain backdrop and and, you know, there's downside bias to your capacity outlook. But if you wind up growing low single digits as was your plan back in January, you still thinking CASM would be up mid singles, or or would the incremental cost save you highlighted earlier, could could you do better than that? Thanks for the time.\nDevon May: I I think if our our capacity ends up being largely in line with where we started the year, our costs are also going to be largely in line with where we started the year. Just say that we're best in the business at managing cost in the long term and also driving efficiencies over the long term that are good for our customers, also good for our team members. That was built into our plan for this year. So while there may be some trimming around the edges I think we have all of the right plans in place to run a really effective and efficient business this year. On the other side, if we do pull capacity, I think we're gonna be really effective in managing, costs out as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Trent of Citi. Please go ahead, Steven.\nSteven Trent: Good morning, everybody. And thanks for taking my question. First, I I was kind of curious. When we think about twenty twenty six, I know it seems like an eternity from now. But looking at sort of the World Cup event, on the horizon, would you guys expect any flux you know, vis a vis what we saw in the transatlantic for the the Paris Olympics last year. Or do you guys have a, like, say, a relative advantage versus other peers because of a a high US point of sale? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Hey, Steven. Thanks. No. Hey. We're really proud to to be a sponsor along with our partner, Qatar. It's the largest sporting event in in in the world, and it's unique in that it is spread out across the United States. Canada, and Mexico, and American Airlines Group is the strongest carrier in all of the host sit or in the vast majority of the host cities. So we're really we're really proud to be the title sponsor. I tell you, this is an event that's that's very different than the Olympics. It's all concentrated in one city, you know, all at one time, that actually, in some cases, can can diminish the demand over a period of time. This is one in which we see tremendous interest in travel and spending time, and we don't believe it will have an impact on the other business that goes into these cities namely because it's spread out and because it will be something that is know, such a a focus. So tremendous excited. Americans are glad to be at the top of that, and it's just another indication of us building for the future.\nSteven Trent: Okay. Super, Robert. Really appreciate that. And just as a quick follow-up to that, can you sort of refresh my memory approximately where is your the percentage of US point of sale for your international?\nSteve Johnson: We we about seventy five percent of our international is sold in US as US point of sale.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question. Comes from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open there, Ravi.\nRavi Shanker: Good morning, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on the normalization of share. It indirect distribution and corporate. How much macro sensitive or agnostic is that share recovery?\nSteve Johnson: That's a really good question. It it is share, first of all. So it's it it's it's not abs absolute numbers. But we're you know, at this period of uncertainty, we're seeing that share build very nicely. And with that and and we're not hearing anecdotally about reduced travel. Our business travel is up overall, as Robert said in his opening remarks. So I you know, it it remains it right now, it doesn't seem to be macro sensitive. I suppose it remains to be seen, but but right now, business traffic seems strong. Our share is growing. We're getting a lot of positive feedback with respect to our new sales and distribution efforts. So fingers crossed, it's it's it's going in the right direction and, you know, really positive part of the our of our revenue effort at this point in time.\nRavi Shanker: That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, apologies if I missed this. But can you talk about Book of Bay following the tragic accident accident and whether or not that has normalized sense.\nRobert Isom: I I I can't. It's it's look. The five fifty three forty two, as I said in my remarks, it had an impact in in the first quarter, had a material impact in in the first quarter. But that's largely been something that is unique to that quarter. And as we take a look to the to the future, we don't anticipate any impact.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Linenberg: Oh, yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Hey. I just wanna go back with Steve. You talked about corporate you know, trending up for being up. I mean, if we look at managed business revenue, that was up eight percent in the March quarter. Based on what you're seeing now, and the fact that you also have a fairly easy comp, because of you know, the sort of the distribution strategy from a year ago and the fact that you are gaining back share, Is that increase should we expect that increase to be higher in the June quarter? That managed business revenue will be better than up eight percent? Given kind of the the underlying kind of the factors that I just mentioned.\nSteve Johnson: Thanks. As I look out, what I expect is that we're gonna continue to grow our share in the in the second quarter. Remember, again, as I said a moment ago, that's share, not absolute. So I'd say, you know, as long as the economy continues to support business traffic, we're gonna continue to grow business traffic in the second quarter.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. And and we should grow it faster than than the other airlines because of our\nSteve Johnson: distribute because of that progress of our distribution efforts.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. And then just a a second question here. Obviously, there's it seems like there's a lot of movement around with respect to the real estate in Chicago. If we think about your gate position today and and where we are know, over the next you know, call it six months or so as gates are reallocated Where are you on a on a net basis on a, you know, I mean, I think it's been reported that you lose Gates but then there's the offset or there's the opportunity to use common use gates So on a net basis, what what what happens to your gate position in Chicago? Are you down or are you flat Any color there would be. Thank you.\nSteve Johnson: Sure. Yeah. Thanks. I mean, first off, as I think you you saw, we're we disagree with the the airports and the city of Chicago's determination on that, and we're appealing that decision. That would have Gates be reallocated during, twenty twenty five. That said, it's gonna take a while to sort that out, I I I expect. And and you know, to the extent that it's not sorted out by October when the new regime would go into place, I think we're in we we feel like we're in good shape. Remember, we're growing Chicago back, and I I expect that we will be able to accommodate our growth in Chicago all the way until the you know, next summer with the gate footprint that we have. But we also expect that gate that growth in Chicago will put us in a really good position to to benefit from the reallocation of Gates that's gonna take place again next February and March. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew D'Dora of Bank of America. Please go ahead, Andrew.\nAndrew D'Dora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions around, certainly, 2Q have been, asked and answered, but Josh, one question for me for for Devin. On the sub thirty five billion dollars of debt by the end of twenty twenty seven. Just curious what you are assuming for liquidity over that time frame as you know, I know you have a a lot of debt coming due, you know, over the next few years. So just curious how you how you're thinking about liquidity. Thank you.\nDevon May: Sure. I I'll just start by saying we are committed to reducing total debts under thirty five billion at the end of twenty twenty seven. And structurally, we're set up really well-to-do that. We've talked about our limited CapEx requirements over that period, so it gives us the potential for a lot of free cash flow. When we think about liquidity, you know, right now, we're holding ten point eight billion dollars We've talked that over time, as we continue to improve the balance sheet, we would expect our levels of liquidity to come down slightly. During this uncertain time, we're gonna, you know, continue to hold right around this ten billion dollar mark, but that is likely to change over time as we expand margins and improve the balance sheet.\nAndrew D'Dora: That's all I had. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Fitzgerald with of TD Cohen. Your question please, Tom.\nTom Fitzgerald: Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. I'm just kinda curious on corporate generally both you know, large manage managed accounts and the small, and medium sized enterprises. If if there's any pockets of green shoots or in any sectors that are demand is looking a little more resilient than some of the sectors like autos or agriculture that we hear about on the news,\nSteve Johnson: Thanks for the question. I you know, we are not seeing any know, real pullback in business travel at this point across the board. You know, that may come later. It'd be economy continues to deteriorate. But but right now, we're you know, our it all looks pretty vibrant. We we maybe look you know, have a better position to look in terms of in terms of improvement because of our sales distribution recovery efforts. But right now, business travel looks good across the board.\nTom Fitzgerald: Okay. That's that's really helpful. And then just you know, going back to the the topic about know, international travel and cross cross border flows, What have your conversations been like, you know, with your government relations team or your contacts in in in DC about conveying the importance of smooth cross border flows to policy makers. Thanks again for the time.\nRobert Isom: No. I appreciate the question. Travel is incredibly important to to to the US. And I think people are aware that almost one in eleven jobs is tied to to travel. One point three trillion dollars of direct spending, two point nine trillion dollars of of overall spending in in in related outside of direct. This is an incredibly important sector to our to our economy. And we have to make this something that is know, the cornerstone of infrastructure. And that starts with not only doing the work we can domestically, but also making the country a a welcoming place. And as we work with the administration, just overall reducing concerns about certainty, we're also getting ready for, you know, where we should be. And that means making sure Visa wait times are very, very limited. That means that we open up travel without visa opportunities. That means that we work with the administration on safe and secure so that when you when you come to one of our our poor that it's easy to get into and you feel like it's it's a process that's not cumbersome. Then, ultimately, we look to the future of making sure that the industry as a whole can continue to grow. That's the long term plan. And from that perspective, we're working with the administration on air traffic control reform, which is likely the biggest limiter to to to growth in the industry as we look at, you know, over several years.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the Q and A session is open and for media questions. We are open for media questions. Our first question comes from the line of Allison Cider of Wall Street Journal. Your line is open, Allison.\nAllison Sider: Hi. Thanks so much. I guess, just wanna ask a broad question. On the economy. And I'm just curious, you know, Robert, like, do you are you expecting? Like, do you expect the US economy to to sort of tip into a recession and kind of what are you watching or keeping an eye on to to gauge whether that's happening?\nRobert Isom: Hey, Ali. Thanks. Right now, there's uncertainty in the marketplace. I know we you've heard that that over and over again, but it's no different in, you know, our planning process than it is for you know, a domestic leisure passenger. You know, right now, we don't know what is going to happen. That means that we're taking a, you know, a a very cautious even a negative approach to, you know, growth as we as we take a look out to to the rest of the year. Does that mean? It means that we don't hire as much. It means that we don't bring out as many planes potentially. It means, you know, the reduction in overall of of economic activity. Same thing for, you know, the the customer that's planning a vacation. Nobody nobody really, you know, relishes uncertainty when they're talking about what you could do on a vacation and and and spend hard earned dollars. So I think that that is an overhang, but it's one that I know that the administration is aware of and wants to get back on track as soon as possible. Certainty will restore the economy, and I think it will restore it pretty quickly. All that said, though, we have to be ready no matter the environment, and American Airlines Group is incredibly well positioned if uncertainty lasts, you know, quite a long time. Devin mentioned all the steps that we've taken to our balance sheet, make sure that we have liquidity on on hand, We're the best at cost managing. We have refleeted the airline in a period of much greater certainty with OEMs and, in a a a a financial environment that was was much more favorable as well. So we're ready for that. And on the other end, on the other side, travel always comes back. And we're ready for that. The investments that we're making, you heard some of of what we talked about in terms of building back our network. But on top of that, it's it's also with a focus on on customer experience. A customer experience is everything from, you know, new flagship suites to a Philadelphia flagship lounge and free Wi Fi. Coming with through partnership with AT and T. And at the end of the day, American Airlines Group has the most opportunity, I believe, to add value to customers and certainly, you know, from a a shareholder return in an environment where the economy comes back. So we're on both sides of it. Been in this business for thirty years. And have gone through everything from SARS to know, obviously obviously, COVID and and nine eleven and great recession and everything in between. We have a leadership team here that is better prepared, experienced. And, also, you know, from what I see, this airline in throughout my entire career going into any type of of a lot better positioned than I've ever been.\nAllison Sider: Thanks. I'm sorry. Our next question comes from the line of Mary Schlongenstein.\nOperator: Of Bloomberg News. Your line is open. Mary,\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. I wanted to ask if you could address the issue of tariffs whether you plan to pay the tariffs on any Airbus deliveries and the impact that you expect from tariffs both on aircraft and on parts. And then secondly, you just mentioned, Robert, manpower in this uncertain environment. I'm wondering if you've already frozen hiring for the rest of the year or taken in any steps in that direction?\nRobert Isom: Hey, Mary. I appreciate the question. So first off, aircraft cost too much already. I don't wanna pay any more for aircraft It doesn't make sense. And, certainly, you know, we're pulling guidance. Certainly, this is not something we would intend to absorb. And I'll tell you, it's not something that I would expect our customers to welcome. So we've gotta work on this. We fortunately don't have any near term deliveries. We have deliveries at the end of the year that would be potentially subject to tariffs. The three twenty one XLRs that are built over in Europe But I would tell you, we gotta do some work before then. And from an overall perspective, I would tell you there's good reason to do something in regard to aviation civil aviation. Because since nineteen seventy nine, we've operated under a tariff regime that has been zero for zero. No tariffs in and no tariffs, you know, purchasing at That's worked very well for civil aviation. And by that, I mean, everything from, you know, aircraft to engines and and and to parts as well. That framework has led to an industry, a sector, that has produced the largest level of exports the largest level of surplus of any industry. And so I know that that's where we wanna end up. Now there may be changes to to that framework, but the end result has to be that the US is a powerhouse and continues to be incredibly strong from an aviation perspective. We're part of that. You know, we're the the we ultimately operate these aircraft. And I I anticipate in working with with the administration that we're gonna end up with with a framework that really does ensure that aviation in the US is competitive. Now in regard to questions about our people, you know, right now, we are planning for the the peak of our schedule. And so we're getting ready for that as we take a look into the fall, it's generally not a time where we do a lot of hiring, but we're we're very focused on that. Right now, we don't quite know exact And and that's certainly coloring our views of twenty twenty six as well. So stay tuned on that. Right now, you know, we're we're We're gonna be nimble depending on what we see in in the the environment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Joseph of CNBC. Please go ahead, Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wondering if you're seeing any gains market share in the Dallas area, since your competitor announced bad fees and some of the other policy changes. That there's any kind of detail on the take up rate of status matches and things like that. And then broadly on, domestic demand, directionally, is it getting worse? Is it getting better? And are there any geographies that you're seeing or or doing worse or better? I'm seeing seven, eight hundred dollar tickets New York, LA, the summer, and then a hundred dollar tickets to Florida. So kinda curious if you could break down where you're seeing the the weakness in the main cabin. Thanks.\nSteve Johnson: Leslie, hi. Thanks. It's it's Steve on on first on the the DFW question, we have a great product. It's in DFW. It's our largest hub. We've fantastic penetration for our frequent flyer program. Fantastic number of co grand cardholders. We're gonna operate the largest operation at DFW in history this summer. So we're really well positioned to compete We've competed with Southwest, you know, through thick and thin over the last forty years very successfully. We recognized that they've you know, made a very significant change in their business model. We saw that they were reported some good numbers yesterday, but, we, you know, we're prepared to compete with them in DFW is is our favorite place to compete with them. With respect to demand, I I just reiterate what I said earlier is that what we're seeing is, you know, strength in the premium cabins, strength in long haul international, strength in bookings through indirect trials, you know, through travel agencies, and pretty significant weakness in, you know, the the the part of our business that is, you know, that's very sensitive to economic conditions that is super price sensitive or that is, you know, for whom travel is really discretionary, that tends to be our the main cabin, and that's that is weak, and and the other airlines have identified that it's a source of weakness for them. And in those circumstances, you do see prices that are lower. You do see some of the sales prices that you quoted I think that's gonna continue to be the case until we understand where, you know, which direction the economy is going and and we remove some of this uncertainty and some of that demand comes off the sidelines.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Latif. And hey, Steve. Thanks for the the response on that. In regards to DFW, I'll just also note that we continue to to to invest I think there's gonna be some really exciting, cool news coming up in the the next week or so. Regarding America's position at DFW and and look forward to talking more about that. I'll close with this. You know, uncertainty is what we're living with now. It is something I know that the country wants to to move beyond, and I know that everybody is is working to that end. No matter the environment, American Airlines Group is well positioned. From a prolonged period of of uncertainty we're ready for it. As I've said before, we have a balance sheet exemplary cost management, a fleet that is ready and and incredibly flexible. A team that is experienced to handle what whatever may come our way. Over the long run, travel comes back, people wanna travel, American Airlines Group is well prepared for that as well. We have a renewed focus on customer experience, You will see American Airlines Group investing in our premium product. We do believe no matter the the economic environment, that customers will want to be treated better. They will want services and amenities that they're certainly willing to pay for. American Airlines Group is committed to being a leader on that front. We got a great network, a great fleet, an incredible set of partners, And over the long run, I know that our priorities of operating with excellence, of ensuring that we treat our customers customers right, working to expand our industry leading loyalty program and partnering with Citi, delivering on our full revenue potential, and continuing to to engine reengineer the business.

A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information we are giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Good morning, everyone. It goes without saying that we're in a challenging economic environment which has had a significant impact on the industry. Historically, the airline industry has done well in periods of economic growth and certainty. The industry exited the fourth quarter with positive momentum, but this quickly shifted during the first quarter. The economic uncertainty in the market has pressured demand and impacted American Airlines Group's first quarter results and second quarter outlook. Given this macro environment, we're withdrawing our full-year outlook. That said, if current demand trends continue, we expect to deliver a profitable year and produce positive free cash flow. At American Airlines Group, we have the foundational strength, resilience, team, and financial and operating flexibility to navigate the current environment. The work we have done the past several years has prepared us for times like these. We completed our fleet renewal in a very different economic environment with lower aircraft costs, lower lease and interest rates, and during a time of OEM and supply chain stability. As a result, we have low aircraft CapEx requirements for the remainder of the decade. We continue to employ our best-in-class cost management to make the airline more efficient. Through our efforts to reengineer the business, we now expect more than $750 million of cumulative cost savings as we exit 2025. We've utilized our free cash flow to strengthen the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had our lowest net debt level since the end of 2015, while simultaneously taking action to smooth our debt maturity obligations going forward. This foundation allows us to focus on our 2025 priorities of running a reliable operation as we reestablish connectivity throughout our network and continue to find ways to run a more efficient airline. We're taking action to deliver on our revenue potential, enhancing our partnership with Citi, growing our Advantage loyalty program, progressing in our sales and distribution indirect channel recovery, and renewing our focus on customer experience to provide the best product and service for everyone who flies with American Airlines Group. As we move forward, we remain committed to delivering on our long-term growing margins, generating sustainable free cash flow, and further strengthening our balance sheet. Now onto our first quarter performance. First quarter unit revenue was up 0.7% year over year, which continues to lead the industry, despite more exposure to a challenging domestic environment. We estimate the impact of American Eagle flight 5342 reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $200 million. Long-haul international passenger RASM continued to lead the way in the first quarter. Atlantic passenger RASM was up 10.5% year over year, and Pacific passenger RASM was up 4.9% on 24.1% more capacity, primarily driven by strength in Japan. Short-haul Latin passenger RASM increased year over year for the first time in more than a year and remains one of the most profitable regions on an absolute basis. We continue to see strong demand for international travel from the US. Domestic passenger RASM was down 0.7% year over year in the quarter as US consumer discretionary spending, especially consumer spending on air travel, decelerated throughout the quarter. Performance in our premium and loyalty revenues continued to show strength year over year. Premium revenue increased 3% year over year in the first quarter on 0.3% lower capacity. Our premium cabin RASM year over year outperformed main cabin RASM by four points in domestic and eight points in international. Paid load factor in our premium cabins remained historically high and was up 2.9 points year over year. Loyalty revenues were up 5% year over year, with spending on our co-branded credit cards up 8% in the quarter. We've begun laying the foundation for our expanded co-branded credit card partnership with Citi, which is set to begin in 2026, and we remain on track to achieve the long-term growth targets we outlined last year. Most importantly, customers continue to recognize the value of our loyalty program, with Advantage enrollments increasing 6% year over year. Advantage members are responsible for 76% of premium cabin revenue. American Airlines Group is proud to have an industry-leading travel rewards program that is frequently recognized for providing the best value for its members. Despite the headwinds in the economy and lower capacity, managed business revenue was up 8% year over year in the first quarter. We remain encouraged by the feedback we're receiving from corporate customers as we continue to engage with them to understand how best to meet their needs. We saw specific strength in the financial and professional services sectors during the quarter. Momentum in recovering revenue from indirect channels continued in the first quarter. We hit our target of reducing the gap versus our historical share to 7% in the first quarter, and we forecast to gain back another two points in the second quarter. We remain on track to restore our revenue share from indirect channels to historical levels as we exit this year. Despite the current macroeconomic uncertainty, we started the year with a conservative growth plan, and we will continue to be mindful of our capacity deployment. The demand and the competitive environments will continue to serve as the guidepost for our future capacity plans. We'll remain nimble and take action as conditions warrant, and we have many levers at our disposal, such as reducing off-peak flying or, if circumstances require, returning leased aircraft, retiring aircraft, and deferring aircraft deliveries to efficiently reduce capacity without jeopardizing the quality of our core network. We're positioning American Airlines Group for sustained long-term success, and a big part of that is transforming our customers' experience and engagement with us. We've established a new customer experience organization, a centralized cohesive team that sits at the intersection of our commercial and operations organizations. This team will advocate on behalf of customers, leading the strategy and implementation of initiatives to improve every part of the customer journey, from bookings to the airport to in-flight experience to customer feedback. Last week, we announced that Advantage members will receive complimentary high-speed satellite Wi-Fi beginning in January 2026, thanks to a new sponsorship with AT&T. We're excited to be able to offer free high-speed satellite Wi-Fi on more aircraft than any other carrier, and it's a great way to demonstrate that we have renewed our focus on the customer experience. American Airlines Group continues to have the youngest fleet of the US network carriers. We're excited to debut our new state-of-the-art flagship suite seat on our first new Boeing 787-9, and we look forward to the rollout of this product on our new Airbus A321XLR aircraft. These deliveries, along with the planned refresh of existing seats, are expected to grow American Airlines Group's lie-flat and premium economy seating by approximately 50% by the end of the decade. Additionally, American Airlines Group has led the way in introducing premium lounges and offers more premium lounges than any other US network carrier. We're committed to reinvigorating the customer experience throughout various touchpoints to the travel journey, and we're on track to open our newest flagship lounge in Philadelphia in May. This lounge will be our ninth premium lounge across the system, with more to come. Finally, we recently announced several changes to improve our boarding process starting next month, and just this week, we introduced a new redesigned mobile app to further enhance customer interactions and self-service options. Turning now to our operation. During the first quarter, the American Airlines Group team demonstrated our resilience and ability to quickly recover from irregular operations. We continue to make investments to drive further enhancements to our operating reliability. Our first quarter operation was impacted by California wildfires, increased winter weather in our Sunbelt hubs, and the tragic accident of flight 5342 on January 29th. Before moving on, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tragedy and pay tribute to the lives lost in the accident. We're supporting the families and loved ones through our Office of Continued Care and Outreach, which we established within a week of the accident. The role and responsibilities of the office will evolve over time, but it will always be focused on ensuring we live out our purpose of caring for people on life's journey. Thank you to our team members who helped in the immediate response to those who kept the operation running while caring for our customers, and to our care team members who supported the families. We continue to work closely with the US government, and we're encouraged by the collective commitment to make the US aviation system even safer going forward. Now I'll turn the call over to Devon to share more about our first quarter financial results and second quarter outlook.\nDevon May: Thank you, Robert. This morning, American Airlines Group reported a first quarter GAAP net loss of $473 million. Excluding special items, we reported a first quarter net loss of $386 million, an adjusted loss of $0.59 per diluted share. We produced first quarter revenue of $12.6 billion, down 0.2% year over year, with unit revenue up 0.7% year over year. First quarter unit cost excluding fuel and net special items was up 7.8% year over year. We are committed to running the airline as efficiently as possible while enhancing the customer experience. Through best-in-class workforce management, efficient asset utilization, and procurement transformation, we now expect to achieve approximately $250 million of cost savings in 2025, on top of the $500 million achieved last year. We also expect an additional $100 million of working capital cash release, bringing our total improvement in working capital to approximately $550 million over the past three years. We continue to see improvements in the productivity of our team and expect mainline full-time employee accounts to stay approximately flat relative to 2024. With regard to our fleet, we expect to take delivery of 40 to 50 new aircraft this year. Based on our current expectations for new deliveries, our 2025 aircraft CapEx, which also includes used aircraft purchases, spare engines, and net PDPs, is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, and our total CapEx is expected to be between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. We continue to expect moderate levels of CapEx moving forward, with aircraft CapEx averaging approximately $3.5 billion for the remainder of the decade. We ended the first quarter with $10.8 billion of total available liquidity, and we produced free cash flow of $1.7 billion in the quarter. During the quarter, we strategically repriced our $2.3 billion Advantage-backed term loan. The repricing lowered the interest rate by nearly 300 basis points and vastly improved the amortization profile, pushing out $1.9 billion of amortization over the next three years into 2028. Additionally, we reduced total debt by $1.2 billion during the quarter. We now have more than $10 billion in unencumbered assets and more than $13 billion in additional first lien borrowing capacity. Our balance sheet is stronger than it has been in nearly a decade, and we remain committed to reducing our total debt to less than $35 billion by year-end 2027. For the second quarter of 2025, we expect capacity to be up 2% to 4% year over year as we continue to build back our northern hubs. We remain focused on deploying profitable capacity and being nimble in response to the demand and competitive environment. We expect second quarter revenue to be down 2% to up 1% year over year as we anticipate softness in the domestic main cabin to continue. To partially offset this, we expect long-haul international and premium bookings to outperform year over year and anticipate additional progress in recovering revenue through our indirect channels. Second quarter non-fuel unit cost is expected to be up 3% to 5% year over year, which is in line with our expectations to start the year. Nearly the entirety of our year-over-year CASM ex increase is driven by the collective bargaining agreements that we have ratified over the past two years. While these collective bargaining agreements have resulted in a meaningful step-up in labor costs, we are pleased that all of our largest work groups enjoy contracts that are in line with industry-leading agreements and that we have labor cost certainty through 2027. Based on our current demand assumptions and fuel price forecast, we expect to produce second quarter earnings of approximately $0.50 to $1.00 per diluted share. I'll now turn the call back to Robert for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Thank you, Devon. The travel industry is a critical engine for the US economy, generating $1.3 trillion in direct spending in the US and supporting one in every eleven US jobs. With increased global travel to the US comes increased spending and investment in economic growth. Airlines are a big part of that equation, and American Airlines Group is proud to be the largest employer of US workers among them. Anything that spurs demand for travel, both domestically and abroad, is something we will support. This starts with making America a welcoming destination for international travelers, especially in advance of major events like the FIFA World Cup 2026, of which we're a sponsor, and later, the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. This means expanding Visa-free travel, lowering Visa processing times, and expediting the deployment of new technologies to make travel more seamless and secure. And, of course, ensuring the growth and long-term health of the travel industry in the US will require us to address critical infrastructure issues, the most pressing of which is ATC modernization. American Airlines Group is committed to working with the administration, regulators, and the rest of the industry to meet each of these challenges. At American Airlines Group, we're resilient by design. The underlying strength of our business and balance sheet and our ability to remain nimble and adjust to the environment gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the path forward. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments and producing results for the airline and for our shareholders. Operator, you may now open the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: You will be limited to one question and one follow-up. Please standby while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of David Scott Vernon of Bernstein. Please go ahead, David.\nDavid Scott Vernon: Good morning, guys. Robert, so I guess the first question I have for you is the earnings release and materials didn't make much mention around sort of capacity moderation given the weakness that we're seeing in demand. Can you talk about kind of how you're thinking about sizing the network as we get through the second half of the year?\nRobert Isom: Mean, clearly, with the financial leverage of the business, you know, I'm sure this is something you guys are looking at. It just like to hear from you kinda what you're thinking about on the capacity front as we look at two h.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, David. Appreciate the question. What we've done is obviously pulled our guidance. We've we more or less have our capacity plan set, for the summer. We plan on on flying that. You saw in our in our second quarter guide, two to four percent growth. We look beyond that, there's a lot of uncertainty Our view as as we go forward is we're gonna be nimble and quick to react. Size demand sized capacity to to demand But I'll tell you right now, we have a negative bias to all capacity as we go forward. We'll know more you know, as as as time develops in the the next several weeks, month, and we'll have more to talk about on that on future earnings calls.\nDavid Scott Vernon: Alright. May maybe just as a follow-up, as you think about the the corporate, sort of share recovery, is that coming in at the yields you would have expected to be coming in? Or is there a little bit of reinvestment required in terms of of recapturing some of that, the business share. Yeah. Thanks for the question. This is Steve.\nSteve Johnson: It's it's coming in just as we expected. And as Robert said in his opening remarks, we're on track to recover share by the end of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James. Please go ahead, Savi.\nSavi Syth: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I know you mentioned it sounds like in 2Q, you're expecting kind of international in premium to continue leading the way. But I was curious if you can provide a little bit more color across the four entities on on how you you know, what's in guidance in terms of performance there?\nSteve Johnson: Sure. Thanks, Alek. It's a across the entities. We're seeing strength through the summer. Really, in each one. Obviously, with with the uncertainty and and just the booking curve visibility beyond the summer's a little unclear right now, but we're seeing really, you know, very good strength in our Heathrow and Europe operation. Strength in the North Pacific, strength in the South Pacific, you know, South America to South America, but it it is doing pretty well. And Argentina is kind of the star of the show down there right now. And it also you know, just don't wanna finish the answer without mentioning that you you know our we're still continue we have a very significant international operation in its short haul in the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and that's performing pretty well.\nSavi Syth: I appreciate that. And if I could on the domestic side, are you expecting much of a deceleration or or, you know, what's the trend into 2Q there?\nSteve Johnson: Domestically, you know, we remain strong in in as we described in the opening remarks, our premium bookings are terrific. Our the bookings through indirect channels are solid. Our business bookings are solid. What we're seeing, though, like the other airlines, airlines, is, you know, really significant weakness in the demand that books through our indirect channels, which is, you know, I think we believe is mostly our most price sensitive customers, our customers for whom travel is most discretionary, And, you know, that's that's where the the issue is. You know, we'd like to think that that's demand that's not been lost, but demand that's on the sidelines waiting to, understand which direction the economy is gonna go. But, nevertheless, at at the moment, that's that we're seeing weakness in those in those cohorts.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Scott.\nScott Group: K. Thanks. So just to follow-up there, that that subset of the business that you're talking about that's I guess, maybe domestic, main cabin, or indirect. What percentage of the of the total business is that end I if international is staying it sounds like international is positive. If know, correct me if I'm wrong. Like,\nSteve Johnson: Right.\nScott Group: are we seeing is this business down? Is this a high down, high single digit kind of RASM right now? On this more domestic main cabin part of the business?\nSteve Johnson: Domestic main cabin is weak, and that's what's driving, I think, the the overall demand numbers that you're seeing and the and the weakness in the in the in the the reports. Right? I think I I'd say mid to high single digit weakness in those groups particularly over the course of the summer is what we're looking at.\nScott Group: Okay. And then I guess are we seeing any signs of that stabilize or is it continuing to get worse? And then maybe just, like, bigger pick you a year ago in q two, I you guys do underperformed on RASM and we heard about well, we lost a lot of corporate We're now getting the corporate back. Why aren't we seeing the RASM benefit of that at least relative to some of the others?\nRobert Isom: Hey, Scott. I just let me let me start with this, which is look. There's a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the environment. We take a look at fourth quarter, tremendous amount of momentum. You go into the first quarter. January kinda came in where we had anticipated. February looked kinda kinda solid. But, really, March and then continuing to April, you know, changed considerably. So we're cautious about what we're looking at in terms of of forecast for second quarter. Because there is so so much uncertainty. And it's why we pulled the our guide beyond that So as we take a look and as Steve mentioned, premium is doing well. International We're winning back our sales in in in from a sales and distribution perspective. We just don't have a lot of clarity what goes beyond that. And even as we take a look in to to the summer, what we know right now, we're telling you the best what we know and, you know, we're gonna have to see how things play out.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Connor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead, Connor.\nConnor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just going back to the US domestic market, I I realize this is a short term question and I hate to ask it, but can you talk about how you've changed your revenue management systems? Are you doing what Delta and United are doing essentially in opening up basic economy earlier? And the question the reason why I asked that is, like, the industry in general has a lot more seats to sell in June versus April. So are you seeing incremental discounting into a month like that relative general? Thank you.\nSteve Johnson: Sure. Thanks for the question. I I well, I I don't have specifics about how Delta and United have set up, but we believe that we are properly set up for a summer that is, you know, along the lines that I just described a moment ago where there's, you know, significant weakness in our main cabin demand, significant weakness among our most discretionary travelers, So our inventory systems and our pricing is set up to accommodate that, to capture you know, all of the demand that is available, under the existing circumstances. And, obviously, those are levers that we can pull and tweak and and and manage very carefully a real time basis. We're monitoring the system the situation, you know, very carefully, make changes every day. But I think right now, our our our setup is is where it needs to be.\nConnor Cunningham: Okay.\nSteve Johnson: Okay. And then, you know, you know, I'd spent a lot of time on their call talking about share shift\nConnor Cunningham: in Chicago. And, you know, I'm just trying to understand from your corporate\nSteve Johnson: travel expectation as you exit this year.\nConnor Cunningham: Like, can you talk about the importance of rebuilding New York\nSteve Johnson: in Chicago in general and, you know, how that correlates to to these getting back the the corporate share that you lost from the distribution changes in general. Thank you.\nSteve Johnson: Sure. Sure. A a a big complicated question, but let me try to unpack it. First first, if United is gaining share in Chicago, they're gaining it from somebody other than us. So let's start there. But and might as well just stick with Chicago. I mean, it's a it's a huge market. It's a huge business. Market. It's, you know, our third largest hub. It's a really key part of our network. It has been, you know, profitable in the past. Even as a shared hub. And, you know, we've been part of Chicago for ninety nine years. We have a really loyal customer base there. We have significant advantage penetration, significant co brand penetration. We've received a really positive reception from our corporate clients as we you know, pivoted on sales and distribution. Chicago's really important to them, and our presence there is really important to our business with them. Geographically, Chicago is important. It's where, you know, we we it's how we take care of and connect to and and provide service to our customers in the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes region. It's how we connect passengers across the northern tier of the United States. And I can also say that that that so far, the Chicago so far, we have increased our share in Chicago, and the overall performance is I think, going exactly in accordance with our plans. New York is New York is is is likewise a, you know, very important part of our network very large market, a market that has always accommodated several airlines. We in New York, we have a large customer and large and loyal customer base. Significant advantage penetration, significant co brand penetration. And we're we're excited about the evolving position that we're that we're creating in New York. Lagarde will be, you know, the largest, I think, operation that we've had in history. We've optimized it, we think, for our New York customers. We've optimized it for our hubs and spokes, and we've optimized it to maximize the the the halo effect that that New York has. At JFK, we've created a really competitive one world hub at t eight in at the airport there. And together with LaGuardia, we and together with our JB partners, we now serve a hundred markets out of New York. We have a know, really significant franchise in the transcontinental market, really significant franchise in London Heathrow, the biggest travel market in the world, I think. And we operate at a really at a two really great facilities in New York with terrific lounge products, terrific retail. Indeed, we're we still we're reimagining the retail at JFK, and I'm told there there's gonna be sixty new stores and restaurants there as that work is completed. So I we're evolving in New York. We're adapting in New York. We're obviously constrained in New York by spots, but we're, I think, really happy with positioning we have there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. First one for Devin. So you know, you're obviously not buying back stock at the moment, which is, you know, a a a good thing. But curious how we should think about your approach to minimum liquidity and capex if operating cash flow deteriorates from here. So which which, you know, bucket or buckets, plural, of collateral would you consider easiest to tap given where market yields are right now?\nDevon May: Yeah. Well, I'll I'll just start by saying I really like the position we're in. You know, we ended the first quarter with ten point eight billion dollars of liquidity. We have made a ton of progress on the balance sheet. We've reduced total debt by fifteen billion dollars from peak levels back in mid twenty twenty one. We have billion dollars of unencumbered assets. We have thirteen billion dollars of first lien capacity. You know, we have really high quality first lien capacity. It's it's out there as well, whether it's, you know, slot gates routes or Mhmm. Advantage backed. We we feel really good about where we're at right now and know, we'll see what we end up doing with it if we do really get into a downside scenario, but we're we're in a great position.\nJamie Baker: Okay. And then following on Connor's question, and it wouldn't be an American earnings call, I suppose, if I didn't ask about one of your hubs. But looking at, Chicago, it it seems that a pretty material portion of the capacity restoration is really early in the morning or pretty late at night. I Can you comment on how RASM you know, sort of at the edges of the workday, however you define that, compares to that of I don't know. Daylight hours for lack of a better term. Although, I suppose that's not a good term for the summer. But you get the idea. Yeah.\nSteve Johnson: Sure, Jamie. I mean, as you grow markets, you you particularly hub markets, you you grow them by adding banks. And so we've added banks at the beginning of the day and the end of the day. There's There's obviously, those are those are gonna be weaker than in the heart of the day. But but they it's cheaper to add those by just improving your asset utilization. Also, it's important to know that, you know, the first slide of the day and the last slide of the day is really important. And so as we think about what we where we wanna end up and Chicago, that's that that's a big step, and, you know, ultimately, those we expect that those banks will improve performance as you know, we have the opportunity to to fly them and have the our customers get more remember American and and those will those will be better. Really important part of our local traffic offering for our Chicagoans is the banks are the first part of the day, and the banks for the last part of the day. So, yeah, they're that's that's what we had always planned and what you would have expected to see.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dwayne Fenigwerth of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, Dwayne.\nDwayne Fenigwerth: Hey. Hey. Thanks. Appreciate the time. Just just on the corporate share recapture, it's hard to find that in your guidance and understand it's a it's a dynamic back drop for sure. But you know, what would be offsetting this share recapture if you're winning back corporates?\nSteve Johnson: From a margin and from a, I guess, implied, you know, RASM perspective. Thanks. I I think that you're not seeing it because it's it's overwhelmed by the weakness in our main cabin demand.\nRobert Isom: And, Steve, I'd I'd add to that. Our government business is Yeah. Is falling off considerably as well. So that would add to it as well.\nDwayne Fenigwerth: Okay. And then apologies. I I really don't wanna ask another Chicago question, but I'll but I'll I'll venture down the path. Again, it might be hard to parse in this backdrop But can you contrast, you know, presumably, some of this was about taking pressure off of a market like Charlotte versus the investment that you're making in a market like Chicago, can you just you know, help us size you know, the the relative benefit in Charlotte from a RASM and margin perspective versus, you know, the relative investment in Chicago. And I guess, when are we done? What what inning are we in of that rebuild in Chicago? Thank you. A baseball question again. What what the what inning are we in in the rebuild of Chicago? It's right now, like, maybe the fourth inning, I think, is about right. Fourth or fifth inning, something like that. And our strategy to grow Chicago didn't have anything to do with our strategy in Charlotte. You know? It Chicago was a place that that is a place that we have been very successful in the past. We took down our Chicago operation during the pandemic. As we we grew our operation after the pandemic, we deployed our assets in the places where demand was the strongest first. Chicago just, you know, was slower to to rebound. But now we're focused on rebuilding the position that we've traditionally had in Chicago. We understand that we'll probably always be second place in Chicago, but that's been you know, a very effective, and it means to serve our customers. Profitable, and a a a position that we like a lot. So that's what we're focused on is rebuilding Chicago. Because Chicago is a really important part of our network, not in Charlotte, you know, we've our our strategy there is to continue to be as large in Charlotte as we can operate. It's a, you know, very efficient, very geographically well placed hub. Very low cost for for purposes of connecting, but, we are, you know, close to capacity at that airport. And so we're just not in a position at least right now to grow it any further.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Catherine.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Just one more on the 2Q revenue guidance, if you allow it. Steve, I think you were talking about you're expecting to see momentum in in international through the summer. That's looking strong, often with that being cabin. So I guess underlying your revenue guidance, are you expecting each international geography to see PRASM improve relative to its one q performance and and the desal is all domestic or or have I got that scrambled?\nSteve Johnson: The I I I think what we are seeing is solid performance in the long haul international markets that is you know, improved year over year. It's hard to I think, to compare second quarter performance to first quarter performance because, you know, the demand's so different. But I would just say sequentially strong. It's still positive. If you if what you're asking is is the year over year growth in the second quarter as good as the year over year growth in the first quarter. I'd say it's decelerating a little bit, but still strong and, again, fueled by really strong premium demand, really strong demand for the premium cabins.\nCatherine O'Brien: Understood. Thanks. And and maybe one for Devin. You guys understandably pulled for your EPS in this very uncertain backdrop and and, you know, there's downside bias to your capacity outlook. But if you wind up growing low single digits as was your plan back in January, you still thinking CASM would be up mid singles, or or would the incremental cost save you highlighted earlier, could could you do better than that? Thanks for the time.\nDevon May: I I think if our our capacity ends up being largely in line with where we started the year, our costs are also going to be largely in line with where we started the year. Just say that we're best in the business at managing cost in the long term and also driving efficiencies over the long term that are good for our customers, also good for our team members. That was built into our plan for this year. So while there may be some trimming around the edges I think we have all of the right plans in place to run a really effective and efficient business this year. On the other side, if we do pull capacity, I think we're gonna be really effective in managing, costs out as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Trent of Citi. Please go ahead, Steven.\nSteven Trent: Good morning, everybody. And thanks for taking my question. First, I I was kind of curious. When we think about twenty twenty six, I know it seems like an eternity from now. But looking at sort of the World Cup event, on the horizon, would you guys expect any flux you know, vis a vis what we saw in the transatlantic for the the Paris Olympics last year. Or do you guys have a, like, say, a relative advantage versus other peers because of a a high US point of sale? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Hey, Steven. Thanks. No. Hey. We're really proud to to be a sponsor along with our partner, Qatar. It's the largest sporting event in in in the world, and it's unique in that it is spread out across the United States. Canada, and Mexico, and American Airlines Group is the strongest carrier in all of the host sit or in the vast majority of the host cities. So we're really we're really proud to be the title sponsor. I tell you, this is an event that's that's very different than the Olympics. It's all concentrated in one city, you know, all at one time, that actually, in some cases, can can diminish the demand over a period of time. This is one in which we see tremendous interest in travel and spending time, and we don't believe it will have an impact on the other business that goes into these cities namely because it's spread out and because it will be something that is know, such a a focus. So tremendous excited. Americans are glad to be at the top of that, and it's just another indication of us building for the future.\nSteven Trent: Okay. Super, Robert. Really appreciate that. And just as a quick follow-up to that, can you sort of refresh my memory approximately where is your the percentage of US point of sale for your international?\nSteve Johnson: We we about seventy five percent of our international is sold in US as US point of sale.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question. Comes from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open there, Ravi.\nRavi Shanker: Good morning, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on the normalization of share. It indirect distribution and corporate. How much macro sensitive or agnostic is that share recovery?\nSteve Johnson: That's a really good question. It it is share, first of all. So it's it it's it's not abs absolute numbers. But we're you know, at this period of uncertainty, we're seeing that share build very nicely. And with that and and we're not hearing anecdotally about reduced travel. Our business travel is up overall, as Robert said in his opening remarks. So I you know, it it remains it right now, it doesn't seem to be macro sensitive. I suppose it remains to be seen, but but right now, business traffic seems strong. Our share is growing. We're getting a lot of positive feedback with respect to our new sales and distribution efforts. So fingers crossed, it's it's it's going in the right direction and, you know, really positive part of the our of our revenue effort at this point in time.\nRavi Shanker: That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, apologies if I missed this. But can you talk about Book of Bay following the tragic accident accident and whether or not that has normalized sense.\nRobert Isom: I I I can't. It's it's look. The five fifty three forty two, as I said in my remarks, it had an impact in in the first quarter, had a material impact in in the first quarter. But that's largely been something that is unique to that quarter. And as we take a look to the to the future, we don't anticipate any impact.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Linenberg: Oh, yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Hey. I just wanna go back with Steve. You talked about corporate you know, trending up for being up. I mean, if we look at managed business revenue, that was up eight percent in the March quarter. Based on what you're seeing now, and the fact that you also have a fairly easy comp, because of you know, the sort of the distribution strategy from a year ago and the fact that you are gaining back share, Is that increase should we expect that increase to be higher in the June quarter? That managed business revenue will be better than up eight percent? Given kind of the the underlying kind of the factors that I just mentioned.\nSteve Johnson: Thanks. As I look out, what I expect is that we're gonna continue to grow our share in the in the second quarter. Remember, again, as I said a moment ago, that's share, not absolute. So I'd say, you know, as long as the economy continues to support business traffic, we're gonna continue to grow business traffic in the second quarter.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. And and we should grow it faster than than the other airlines because of our\nSteve Johnson: distribute because of that progress of our distribution efforts.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. And then just a a second question here. Obviously, there's it seems like there's a lot of movement around with respect to the real estate in Chicago. If we think about your gate position today and and where we are know, over the next you know, call it six months or so as gates are reallocated Where are you on a on a net basis on a, you know, I mean, I think it's been reported that you lose Gates but then there's the offset or there's the opportunity to use common use gates So on a net basis, what what what happens to your gate position in Chicago? Are you down or are you flat Any color there would be. Thank you.\nSteve Johnson: Sure. Yeah. Thanks. I mean, first off, as I think you you saw, we're we disagree with the the airports and the city of Chicago's determination on that, and we're appealing that decision. That would have Gates be reallocated during, twenty twenty five. That said, it's gonna take a while to sort that out, I I I expect. And and you know, to the extent that it's not sorted out by October when the new regime would go into place, I think we're in we we feel like we're in good shape. Remember, we're growing Chicago back, and I I expect that we will be able to accommodate our growth in Chicago all the way until the you know, next summer with the gate footprint that we have. But we also expect that gate that growth in Chicago will put us in a really good position to to benefit from the reallocation of Gates that's gonna take place again next February and March. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew D'Dora of Bank of America. Please go ahead, Andrew.\nAndrew D'Dora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions around, certainly, 2Q have been, asked and answered, but Josh, one question for me for for Devin. On the sub thirty five billion dollars of debt by the end of twenty twenty seven. Just curious what you are assuming for liquidity over that time frame as you know, I know you have a a lot of debt coming due, you know, over the next few years. So just curious how you how you're thinking about liquidity. Thank you.\nDevon May: Sure. I I'll just start by saying we are committed to reducing total debts under thirty five billion at the end of twenty twenty seven. And structurally, we're set up really well-to-do that. We've talked about our limited CapEx requirements over that period, so it gives us the potential for a lot of free cash flow. When we think about liquidity, you know, right now, we're holding ten point eight billion dollars We've talked that over time, as we continue to improve the balance sheet, we would expect our levels of liquidity to come down slightly. During this uncertain time, we're gonna, you know, continue to hold right around this ten billion dollar mark, but that is likely to change over time as we expand margins and improve the balance sheet.\nAndrew D'Dora: That's all I had. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Fitzgerald with of TD Cohen. Your question please, Tom.\nTom Fitzgerald: Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. I'm just kinda curious on corporate generally both you know, large manage managed accounts and the small, and medium sized enterprises. If if there's any pockets of green shoots or in any sectors that are demand is looking a little more resilient than some of the sectors like autos or agriculture that we hear about on the news,\nSteve Johnson: Thanks for the question. I you know, we are not seeing any know, real pullback in business travel at this point across the board. You know, that may come later. It'd be economy continues to deteriorate. But but right now, we're you know, our it all looks pretty vibrant. We we maybe look you know, have a better position to look in terms of in terms of improvement because of our sales distribution recovery efforts. But right now, business travel looks good across the board.\nTom Fitzgerald: Okay. That's that's really helpful. And then just you know, going back to the the topic about know, international travel and cross cross border flows, What have your conversations been like, you know, with your government relations team or your contacts in in in DC about conveying the importance of smooth cross border flows to policy makers. Thanks again for the time.\nRobert Isom: No. I appreciate the question. Travel is incredibly important to to to the US. And I think people are aware that almost one in eleven jobs is tied to to travel. One point three trillion dollars of direct spending, two point nine trillion dollars of of overall spending in in in related outside of direct. This is an incredibly important sector to our to our economy. And we have to make this something that is know, the cornerstone of infrastructure. And that starts with not only doing the work we can domestically, but also making the country a a welcoming place. And as we work with the administration, just overall reducing concerns about certainty, we're also getting ready for, you know, where we should be. And that means making sure Visa wait times are very, very limited. That means that we open up travel without visa opportunities. That means that we work with the administration on safe and secure so that when you when you come to one of our our poor that it's easy to get into and you feel like it's it's a process that's not cumbersome. Then, ultimately, we look to the future of making sure that the industry as a whole can continue to grow. That's the long term plan. And from that perspective, we're working with the administration on air traffic control reform, which is likely the biggest limiter to to to growth in the industry as we look at, you know, over several years.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the Q and A session is open and for media questions. We are open for media questions. Our first question comes from the line of Allison Cider of Wall Street Journal. Your line is open, Allison.\nAllison Sider: Hi. Thanks so much. I guess, just wanna ask a broad question. On the economy. And I'm just curious, you know, Robert, like, do you are you expecting? Like, do you expect the US economy to to sort of tip into a recession and kind of what are you watching or keeping an eye on to to gauge whether that's happening?\nRobert Isom: Hey, Ali. Thanks. Right now, there's uncertainty in the marketplace. I know we you've heard that that over and over again, but it's no different in, you know, our planning process than it is for you know, a domestic leisure passenger. You know, right now, we don't know what is going to happen. That means that we're taking a, you know, a a very cautious even a negative approach to, you know, growth as we as we take a look out to to the rest of the year. Does that mean? It means that we don't hire as much. It means that we don't bring out as many planes potentially. It means, you know, the reduction in overall of of economic activity. Same thing for, you know, the the customer that's planning a vacation. Nobody nobody really, you know, relishes uncertainty when they're talking about what you could do on a vacation and and and spend hard earned dollars. So I think that that is an overhang, but it's one that I know that the administration is aware of and wants to get back on track as soon as possible. Certainty will restore the economy, and I think it will restore it pretty quickly. All that said, though, we have to be ready no matter the environment, and American Airlines Group is incredibly well positioned if uncertainty lasts, you know, quite a long time. Devin mentioned all the steps that we've taken to our balance sheet, make sure that we have liquidity on on hand, We're the best at cost managing. We have refleeted the airline in a period of much greater certainty with OEMs and, in a a a a financial environment that was was much more favorable as well. So we're ready for that. And on the other end, on the other side, travel always comes back. And we're ready for that. The investments that we're making, you heard some of of what we talked about in terms of building back our network. But on top of that, it's it's also with a focus on on customer experience. A customer experience is everything from, you know, new flagship suites to a Philadelphia flagship lounge and free Wi Fi. Coming with through partnership with AT and T. And at the end of the day, American Airlines Group has the most opportunity, I believe, to add value to customers and certainly, you know, from a a shareholder return in an environment where the economy comes back. So we're on both sides of it. Been in this business for thirty years. And have gone through everything from SARS to know, obviously obviously, COVID and and nine eleven and great recession and everything in between. We have a leadership team here that is better prepared, experienced. And, also, you know, from what I see, this airline in throughout my entire career going into any type of of a lot better positioned than I've ever been.\nAllison Sider: Thanks. I'm sorry. Our next question comes from the line of Mary Schlongenstein.\nOperator: Of Bloomberg News. Your line is open. Mary,\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. I wanted to ask if you could address the issue of tariffs whether you plan to pay the tariffs on any Airbus deliveries and the impact that you expect from tariffs both on aircraft and on parts. And then secondly, you just mentioned, Robert, manpower in this uncertain environment. I'm wondering if you've already frozen hiring for the rest of the year or taken in any steps in that direction?\nRobert Isom: Hey, Mary. I appreciate the question. So first off, aircraft cost too much already. I don't wanna pay any more for aircraft It doesn't make sense. And, certainly, you know, we're pulling guidance. Certainly, this is not something we would intend to absorb. And I'll tell you, it's not something that I would expect our customers to welcome. So we've gotta work on this. We fortunately don't have any near term deliveries. We have deliveries at the end of the year that would be potentially subject to tariffs. The three twenty one XLRs that are built over in Europe But I would tell you, we gotta do some work before then. And from an overall perspective, I would tell you there's good reason to do something in regard to aviation civil aviation. Because since nineteen seventy nine, we've operated under a tariff regime that has been zero for zero. No tariffs in and no tariffs, you know, purchasing at That's worked very well for civil aviation. And by that, I mean, everything from, you know, aircraft to engines and and and to parts as well. That framework has led to an industry, a sector, that has produced the largest level of exports the largest level of surplus of any industry. And so I know that that's where we wanna end up. Now there may be changes to to that framework, but the end result has to be that the US is a powerhouse and continues to be incredibly strong from an aviation perspective. We're part of that. You know, we're the the we ultimately operate these aircraft. And I I anticipate in working with with the administration that we're gonna end up with with a framework that really does ensure that aviation in the US is competitive. Now in regard to questions about our people, you know, right now, we are planning for the the peak of our schedule. And so we're getting ready for that as we take a look into the fall, it's generally not a time where we do a lot of hiring, but we're we're very focused on that. Right now, we don't quite know exact And and that's certainly coloring our views of twenty twenty six as well. So stay tuned on that. Right now, you know, we're we're We're gonna be nimble depending on what we see in in the the environment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Joseph of CNBC. Please go ahead, Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wondering if you're seeing any gains market share in the Dallas area, since your competitor announced bad fees and some of the other policy changes. That there's any kind of detail on the take up rate of status matches and things like that. And then broadly on, domestic demand, directionally, is it getting worse? Is it getting better? And are there any geographies that you're seeing or or doing worse or better? I'm seeing seven, eight hundred dollar tickets New York, LA, the summer, and then a hundred dollar tickets to Florida. So kinda curious if you could break down where you're seeing the the weakness in the main cabin. Thanks.\nSteve Johnson: Leslie, hi. Thanks. It's it's Steve on on first on the the DFW question, we have a great product. It's in DFW. It's our largest hub. We've fantastic penetration for our frequent flyer program. Fantastic number of co grand cardholders. We're gonna operate the largest operation at DFW in history this summer. So we're really well positioned to compete We've competed with Southwest, you know, through thick and thin over the last forty years very successfully. We recognized that they've you know, made a very significant change in their business model. We saw that they were reported some good numbers yesterday, but, we, you know, we're prepared to compete with them in DFW is is our favorite place to compete with them. With respect to demand, I I just reiterate what I said earlier is that what we're seeing is, you know, strength in the premium cabins, strength in long haul international, strength in bookings through indirect trials, you know, through travel agencies, and pretty significant weakness in, you know, the the the part of our business that is, you know, that's very sensitive to economic conditions that is super price sensitive or that is, you know, for whom travel is really discretionary, that tends to be our the main cabin, and that's that is weak, and and the other airlines have identified that it's a source of weakness for them. And in those circumstances, you do see prices that are lower. You do see some of the sales prices that you quoted I think that's gonna continue to be the case until we understand where, you know, which direction the economy is going and and we remove some of this uncertainty and some of that demand comes off the sidelines.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Latif. And hey, Steve. Thanks for the the response on that. In regards to DFW, I'll just also note that we continue to to to invest I think there's gonna be some really exciting, cool news coming up in the the next week or so. Regarding America's position at DFW and and look forward to talking more about that. I'll close with this. You know, uncertainty is what we're living with now. It is something I know that the country wants to to move beyond, and I know that everybody is is working to that end. No matter the environment, American Airlines Group is well positioned. From a prolonged period of of uncertainty we're ready for it. As I've said before, we have a balance sheet exemplary cost management, a fleet that is ready and and incredibly flexible. A team that is experienced to handle what whatever may come our way. Over the long run, travel comes back, people wanna travel, American Airlines Group is well prepared for that as well. We have a renewed focus on customer experience, You will see American Airlines Group investing in our premium product. We do believe no matter the the economic environment, that customers will want to be treated better. They will want services and amenities that they're certainly willing to pay for. American Airlines Group is committed to being a leader on that front. We got a great network, a great fleet, an incredible set of partners, And over the long run, I know that our priorities of operating with excellence, of ensuring that we treat our customers customers right, working to expand our industry leading loyalty program and partnering with Citi, delivering on our full revenue potential, and continuing to to engine reengineer the business. It will enable us to get back to growing margins, delivering free cash flow strengthening our balance sheet so American Airlines Group is ready for whatever make come long into the future. So thank you, and, I appreciate the the time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Scott Long, VP of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please, go ahead.\nScott Long: Thank you, Latif. Good morning and welcome to the American Airlines Group fourth quarter and full-year 2024 earnings conference call. On the call with prepared remarks, we have our CEO Robert Isom and our CFO Devon May. In addition to our Vice Chair Steve Johnson, we have a number of other senior executives in the room this morning for the Q&A session. Robert will start the call with an overview of our performance, and Devon will follow with details on the fourth quarter and full-year in addition to outlining our operating plans and outlook going forward. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Before we begin today, we must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecasts of capacity, and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning, as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter end at September 30, 2024. In addition, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found in the investor relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information we are giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, American reported a fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax profit of $808 million or an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.86, above the high end of the guidance we issued in early December. For the full-year, we reported an adjusted pre-tax profit of $1.8 billion or an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.96. I want to thank the American Airlines team for a great year and for their resiliency, continued hard work and dedication to delivering a safe and reliable operation for our customers. As I've said previously, at American, we're focused on delivering results. As we closed out 2024, we achieved a number of notable milestones. With the ratification of a contract extension with our mechanics and fleet service team members in October, we now have multi-year agreements in place with all of our largest work groups, providing labor cost certainty through 2027. We delivered nearly $500 million of value through our reengineering initiatives, nearly $100 million more than expected. We announced a new 10-year agreement with Citi to become the exclusive issuer of the AAdvantage co-branded credit card portfolio in the United States, which we expect will drive substantial incremental value to American over the life of the agreement, while unlocking even more value for AAdvantage members. We generated record free cash flow of $2.2 billion in 2024. And I'm excited to report that as of the end of 2024, we have reduced our total debt by more than $15 billion from peak levels in mid-2021, achieving our initial debt reduction goal a full-year ahead of schedule. While there's still much work to do, these accomplishments are clear evidence that the American Airlines team is committed to delivering results and achieving our stated objectives. Now, on to our fourth quarter performance. Total revenue grew 4.6% on 2.5% higher capacity year-over-year. This resulted in our unit revenue inflecting positive in the quarter, up 2% year-over-year and above the high-end of our December guidance. Passenger revenue strength throughout the fourth quarter was broad-based. In the fourth quarter, American's year-over-year Domestic, Atlantic, Pacific and total passenger unit revenue results led U.S. network carriers. While Latin unit revenue was down on a year-over-year basis, we expect short-haul Latin year-over-year unit revenue to be positive in the first quarter. This strong performance is the result of the actions we have taken and we're encouraged by the trends we see early in the year. Demand for American's product remains strong as evidenced by the continued strength of our business, premium and loyalty revenue performance. In the fourth quarter, managed business revenue was, up 8% year-over-year, a sequential improvement of 2 points versus last quarter and we continue to see yield strength as we look ahead into the new year. Premium revenue increased approximately 8% year-over-year. Paid load factor in our premium cabins remains historically high and was up 3 points year-over-year with strength in both Domestic and International. In the fourth quarter, loyalty revenues were up approximately 14% year-over-year with AAdvantage members responsible for 75% of premium cabin revenue. 2024 was a record year for AAdvantage. Throughout the year, we had a record number of customers enrolled in the program with members earning and burning more miles than any year in our history. Spending on our co-branded credit cards was up 9.5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, further highlighting the value of our loyalty program. American is proud to have an industry-leading travel rewards program that is frequently acknowledged as providing the best value for its members. Finally, we remain committed to providing a leading customer experience, especially for our premium customers. We're excited to introduce our new state-of-the-art flagship suite on our new Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321XLR aircraft later this year. Over the course of the next four years, we expect to grow our long-haul international capable fleet from approximately 125 aircraft today to nearly 200 aircraft in 2029. Additionally, American has led the way in introducing premium lounges and we're on track to open our fifth flagship lounge this summer in Philadelphia, which marks the ninth premium lounge across the system. In the fourth quarter, we introduced boarding automation as a first step to improving the boarding process and customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. American was the first airline to offer streaming entertainment on our mainline fleet, and we're proud to offer high-speed Wi-Fi on more aircraft than any other domestic airline. In December, we began the installation of high-speed satellite Wi-Fi on our dual-class regional aircraft. We expect the entire fleet will be retrofitted by the end of this year. Additionally, we're in the process of redesigning our mobile app, making it easier to navigate and to provide more self-service options for our customers. Building on these customer-focused initiatives is one of our top priorities and we'll have more to share in the months ahead. Momentum in recovering revenue from indirect channels continued in the fourth quarter and we remain on track to fully restore our revenue share from indirect channels as we exit this year. Our indirect flown revenue share improvement was driven by sequential gains in corporate revenue share, which has been the primary focus of our recovery efforts. Importantly, forward bookings continue to show strength into the first quarter. As we enter the new year, we're in position to continue recovering share in indirect channels. We've completed new contracts with all of our agency partners that serve our corporate customers and agreed to new agreements with the leisure agencies that serve our most profitable leisure customers. Additionally, we've reviewed and reworked agreements with our corporate customers most affected by the previous strategy and largely restored share of those travelers in our hub markets. Completing these steps provides a strong foundation for us to continue to compete for that business and restore our share in these important distribution channels and with those customers. Last year, we took steps to further grow and optimize AAdvantage. In December, we announced a 10-year agreement with Citi to become the exclusive issuer of the AAdvantage co-branded credit card portfolio in the U.S. American has had a partnership with Citi for more than 37-years. The strength of that partnership has enabled us to deliver first-class products and customer service to millions of AAdvantage card members and we're excited to continue to partner with Citi. Our 2024 cash from co-branded credit cards and other partners was $6.1 billion, an increase of 17% versus 2023. The 2024 amount includes a one-time cash payment received in the fourth quarter related to our new credit card agreement. As we disclosed at the time of the announcement, we expect the agreement set to begin in 2026 will enable cash payments from our co-branded credit card and other partners to grow by approximately 10% annually. As annual cash payments from co-branded credit card and other partners approaches $10 billion, we expect annual pre-tax income will benefit by approximately $1.5 billion, compared to 2024. Our expanded partnership with Citi will unlock more value and provide exciting new benefits to our customers. With the agreement completed, the teams have turned toward building the business and we look forward to making several exciting announcements over the coming year. Turning now to our operation. Thanks to the resiliency of the American Airlines team, we delivered another quarter of strong results, despite a difficult operating environment. Operational disruptions are part of the airline business. And in American, we continue to show that operational resiliency and rapid recovery are part of our DNA. In the fourth quarter, American ranked second in completion factor and on-time departures among the four largest U.S., carriers. For the year, we achieved our second-best completion factor since the merger, carrying our largest-ever volume of passengers. Looking ahead, continued investment in the operation and the technology that supports it will drive further improvements in our operating reliability and resiliency. In closing, we've achieved a number of important objectives in 2024 and our performance in the fourth quarter shows what this team and what this airline are capable of. That foundation and the momentum we've built will serve us well in 2025. Before I turn the call over to Devon, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge those impacted by the devastating wildfires in Southern California. Our hearts go out to those communities. American's AAdvantage members and team members have donated more than $1.7 million in funds to the American Red Cross to support relief efforts, and we've donated supplies and care packages to families and firefighters in the Los Angeles area. And with that, I'll turn it over to Devon to share more about our fourth quarter and full year financial results and our outlook for 2025.\nDevon May: Thank you, Robert. Excluding net special items, we reported a fourth quarter net income of $609 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.86. We produced record fourth quarter revenue of $13.7 billion, up 4.6% year-over-year with unit revenue up 2% year-over-year. Fourth quarter unit cost, excluding fuel and net special items, was up 5.7% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDAR margin was 14.9% and we produced an adjusted operating margin of 8.4%. In 2024, we achieved nearly $500 million of savings from our reengineering the business initiatives, exceeding our goal by nearly $100 million. Most of the value in 2024 was due to better workforce management driven by process improvements and technology implementation, along with improved asset utilization and procurement savings. We also had nearly $350 million of working capital cash release, which exceeded our expectations and helped drive our 2024 free cash flow performance. We remain focused on running the airline as efficiently as possible, while enhancing the customer experience. Moving to our fleet. In 2024, we took delivery of 20 new aircraft and 10 used aircraft resulting in $1.9 billion of aircraft CapEx. Total CapEx for 2024 came in at $2.7 billion. Looking ahead, we expect to take delivery of 40 to 50 new aircraft in 2025. Based on our current expectation for new deliveries, our 2025 aircraft CapEx, which also includes used aircraft purchases, spare engines and net PDPs, is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion and our total CapEx is expected to be between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. We continue to expect moderate levels of CapEx moving forward with aircraft CapEx averaging between $3 billion and $3.5 billion for the remainder of the decade. We ended 2024 with $10.3 billion of total available liquidity and produced record free cash flow of $2.2 billion. During the fourth quarter, we prepaid $750 million of near-term debt maturities and strategically repriced two term loans. We ended the year with total debt of $38.6 billion and net debt of $31.6 billion, our lowest level of net debt since 2015. With these actions, we achieved our total debt reduction goal of $15 billion from peak levels in mid-2021 a full-year ahead of schedule. We are thrilled to have delivered on this commitment and we remain focused on continuing to strengthen our balance sheet as we work toward our stated credit rating goal of BB. Previously, we committed to reducing total debt to less than $35 billion by year-end 2028. We are now committing to achieve that goal by the end of 2027. Now on to the outlook for 2025. In the first quarter, we expect capacity to be flat to down 2% year-over-year. This capacity is driven by lower capacity in the off-peak months of January and February, which combined are down approximately 3%, followed by growth of 3% to 4% in the peak travel period in March. We continue to expect full-year capacity to be up low-single-digits, in line with expected economic growth and our prior guidance. Our growth in 2025 is focused on improving our schedule in markets that are not yet fully restored to historical levels, primarily in our Northern hubs. We expect our year-over-year capacity growth rates to be fairly balanced between Domestic and International operations. We will remain flexible and will adjust capacity in response to demand and the competitive environment in which we operate. We expect first quarter revenue to be up 3% to 5% and for the full-year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 4.5% to 7.5% versus 2024. This is driven by continued indirect revenue recapture, strong demand for our product and a constructive industry backdrop with supply in line with expected demand. First quarter non-fuel unit costs are expected to be up high-single-digits year-over-year. This unit cost growth is driven by the reduction in year-over-year capacity, the mix of that capacity and the new collective bargaining agreements that were reached in the second-half of 2024. In the first quarter, regional ASMs will be up approximately 17% as we return to full utilization and mainline capacity will be down 2% to 3%. Based on the timing of our labor agreements and the shape of capacity, we expect unit costs to improve sequentially throughout the year from high-single-digits in the first quarter to low-single-digits as we exit the year. For the full-year, we expect non-fuel unit cost to be up mid-single-digits year-over-year with a large majority of the cost growth coming from higher salaries and benefits. As we look out to 2026, we have certainty in our labor costs and the rate pressure from our new collective bargaining agreements will ease. We expect that in 2026 our year-over-year growth of our salaries and benefits per ASM will be well inside of inflation. We continue to focus on reengineering the business to become more efficient. Through best-in-class workforce management, efficient asset utilization and procurement transformation, we expect more than $200 million of incremental cost savings in 2025. Additionally, we are investing in a multi-year transformation in our IT and TechOps organizations to modernize technology, improve operations and optimize staffing costs. We anticipate continuing to productively utilize our workforce with mainline full-time employee counts staying approximately flat to 2024. This year, we also expect more than $100 million in additional working capital improvements. Based on our current demand assumptions and fuel price forecast, we expect a first quarter loss of approximately $0.20 to $0.40 per diluted share. For the full-year, we are expecting to deliver adjusted earnings per diluted share of approximately $1.70 to $2.70. We expect another year of record free cash flow generation in 2025 and are currently forecasting more than $2 billion of free cash flow for the full-year. Now, I'll turn it back to Robert for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Devon. As we start 2025, the long-term targets we outlined last March remain our focus, growing margins, generating sustainable free cash flow and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. Our priorities for this year will continue the momentum we built in the back half of last year and further our progress toward achieving our long-term targets. In 2025, we plan to operate with excellence and efficiently deliver a safe and reliable operation, take a fresh look at our product and service as we sharpen our focus on the customer experience, continue to strengthen our network, both organically and through our airline partnerships. Our December announcement with Citi was an important milestone for American. It will allow us to enhance AAdvantage and further strengthen our leading travel awards and co-branded credit card program ecosystem. All of these priorities, including the restoration of our core sales and distribution initiatives, will allow us to deliver on our revenue potential and we'll continue our work to reengineer the business as we build a more efficient airline. We know that by delivering on our commitments, we'll unlock significant value for our shareholders. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] [Technical Difficulty] line of Catherine. Your line is open, Catherine.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning everyone, thanks so much for the time. So, you know, we don't know exactly what low-single-digit capacity growth means for the year, but if I just use 2%, that means the RASM growth is about 4% for the year versus the 5% of getting in 1Q on your guidance. You know, I understand capacity growth accelerates over the year, but can you talk about your assumptions on indirect revenue improvement and the industry outlook underlying that full-year guide? And just really wondering like what could go better than your base case?\nRobert Isom: So, Catherine, thanks. I'll start on our expectations for indirect revenue recovery, and Devon can speak to capacity, and Steve can add anything that he thinks is important as well. We're on track for recovering what we had lost. I feel really good about the progress we've made in a short six month period. And as we take a look, and you can see from our notes, as we take a look at forward bookings, it really suggests that we've got traction in the marketplace. So I have great confidence that we're going to recover fully as we move through the year. And then, you know, I just also, you know, note this, that we also believe that from a revenue performance perspective, even outside of indirect channels, we think that we're poised to perform and outperform. You saw it in our fourth quarter results and I can't speak to others assumptions, but in an environment where the economy is improving, I think that we're going to improve faster than our largest competitors. Devon?\nDevon May: Yes, I don't think there's any big moves in the quarterly capacity numbers. We guided the first quarter which will be down 0% to 2%. The remaining quarters will probably be all up in the neighborhood of 3% per quarter in terms of ASM capacity, which gets you about to that midpoint on low-single-digit capacity for the year.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it.\nSteve Johnson: Catherine, this is Steve. I'll just follow up with you. You asked about sources of potential upside from our base case. I'll just offer three. First, I think that there's a decent chance that we could restore our sales and distribution -- restore sales and distribution revenue faster than Robert's by the end of 2025. I think that's an upside. Second, I would point you to both the third quarter and especially the fourth quarter. Ultimately we're going to be judged on everything and certainly revenue by our results. And I think the fourth quarter shows what we're capable of. And then finally I'd just point to our agreement with Citi. The new agreement doesn't start until 2026 and so the growth that we focus on from -- won't start until then. But there is -- to get to that there is a ramp-up effort underway that I think could provide upside in co-brand revenue during the year.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. Thanks for that additional color, Steve. Devon, maybe one more for you. As you've reached your medium-term debt goal, can you speak to how you're thinking about capital allocation between now and that longer-term goal in 2027? Understand you have more deleveraging to do to hit that 2027 goal. And then you mentioned a BB credit rating. But what's the gating factor to consider shareholder return? Thanks so much for all the time.\nDevon May: Hey, thanks, Katie. Well, I'll just start. We are really proud of achieving the $15 billion goal that we set out to do two or three years ago at this point and we achieved it a year early. But our focus still remains on improving the balance sheet. We've set another near-term goal here to have it -- total debt down another $4 billion to around $35 billion by 2027. So we'll focus on that. We'll continue to focus on reinvesting in the business. And as we continue to improve free cash flow and improve the balance sheet, we'll come back and talk more about other capital allocation priorities.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Your question please, Connor. Our next question comes from the line of Connor Cunningham of Melius Research. Your line is open, Connor. Conor, please make sure your line isn't muted, and if you have a speakerphone lift your handset. We'll go to the next question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your question please, Scott.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So Devon, I think you laid out CASM going from high-singles to start the year towards low-singles ending the year. It doesn't seem like guidance implies a big deceleration in RASM throughout the year. So can you just talk about how you see the progression of price cost on a net basis trending throughout the year?\nDevon May: Well, I'll just start by talking a little bit about our cost performance, because right now we are seeing some more pressure in the first quarter than we are during the rest of the year. So to start, we are really proud of our cost performance over the last several years. I'm excited about what the company is doing to reengineer the business and drive more efficiencies. I think we're making really nice investments in technology. The operations team is really leaning into this and I think we're delivering a more efficient operation, better operation for our customers. In the first quarter, though, we are seeing unit costs up high-single-digits. It's a handful of things. We have less capacity in the first quarter than we did a year ago. That starts to change as we grow capacity in the last three quarters of the year. We have a ton of regional capacity coming online. As you know that's higher cost capacity than the mainline capacity. It's actually driving average gauge to be down 4% to 5% in the first quarter year-over-year. Stage length is down as well. And then of course, the labor agreements that were signed in the back half of last year weren't in our base for this year. So we see a lot of cost pressure in the first quarter. It eases throughout the year. We feel we're incredibly well-positioned as we get into 2026. And we know we run the business as efficiently as anybody. On the margin side, I don't think there's any quarter that show outsized margin improvement year-over-year. We've guided EPS to a midpoint of $2.20. So we are seeing nice EPS improvement year-over-year. But I don't think you're going to see any one quarter pop really materially versus what we perform -- or versus how we performed in 2024.\nScott Group: Okay. And then can you just talk about maybe the progression of RASM throughout Q4 and then just regionally how you see RASM playing out in Q1? Like Transatlantic was up 12% in Q4. Can that sustain itself in the near-term? Just any regional color? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Well, Scott, thanks for that. I'd just point to the fourth quarter in which we had strong performance across the board. So Atlantic, Pacific and then also Domestic in terms of year-over-year improvement, led our network competitors and overall we led it as well. As we take a look out into this year, I see continued strength domestically and the strong dollar is absolutely going to have an impact on buying and travel to Europe this summer. So we take a look to March and as we look to some of our peak periods, spring break and getting into the summer, I see robust demand across the board. We've talked about premium traffic as being wind behind our sales and also something that I think that we're going to be able to do even better in. And Steve mentioned some of the things that are going to be additive as well in terms of potential for even better performance. So overall, really confident about the year and like what we see and how we can operate in this environment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. So an interesting statistic that United throughout yesterday was that the margin gap between its best and worst performing hubs had narrowed to, I guess, the lowest gap in, I think, it was nine or 10-years. We've discussed American's relative hub performance on these calls and in person for quite some time, but I never asked about the range. Would you be willing to comment on that margin range between your top and bottom hubs and whether it's improving or widening? Obviously, a lot of moving pieces in many of your hubs at the moment. Thanks.\nRobert Isom: Okay. Hey, thanks, Jamie. And I'll start. Devon and Steve can add in. Look, it's no secret that we've had to build back our network and we have a large portion of our network that is supported by our regional fleet. I feel great that in 2025 we're going to have our regional fleet fully deployed. And what that's going to allow us to do is better fill out some of the hubs that, quite frankly, are ready and I think willing to support the network in a different way. But we've got to put the capacity there. So you're going to see the largest schedules that we've ever had in places like DFW in Charlotte, Miami in its peak, will be bigger than it's ever been. DCA, which had been a laggard coming out of the pandemic, is now getting back to the performance levels that we had hoped. And we've talked about some of the work that we're going to be in Chicago. So across the board, we see performance improving. Some of the weaker points in our network as we take a look to the coast in New York and out in Los Angeles, I'd say this, that the schedule changes that we've made in LaGuardia, the largest schedule that we've run since the pandemic I believe just as we closed out the fourth quarter, we're really seeing nice results in terms of where we put that capacity. And so from that perspective, I believe that we have improved considerably our New York performance. And I hope and have confidence that that will be something that we can maintain going forward. In Los Angeles, from that perspective, there are some capacity restrictions, but on that front, that's one where we really do partner well with our Oneworld partner, Alaska Airlines, and we look forward to continuing that progress. So when you take a look at American, you've always known that DFW, Charlotte, DCA and now DCA getting back into the ranks have performed well. Philadelphia is getting back to where it should be. Phoenix is -- has historically been strong. And then as I mentioned, we've got a focus on the coasts in Chicago.\nJamie Baker: Yes. That's helpful. And then while I have you, Robert, when I last saw you, which I think was in September, you mentioned you were spending half your time on efforts to reconcile with corporate accounts. And I think you said that publicly in a -- at a conference or two. And I don't know if you actually meant precisely 50% or if that was just sort of metaphorical. But by the way you describe the effort in your prepared remarks makes it sound like most of that effort is behind you. Is that the right interpretation? I guess I'm just confused on exactly where American is on the reconciliation front and how managed corporate recovery trends from here. Thanks in advance.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Jamie. Look, I will give a ton of credit to our commercial team led by Steve Johnson for the enormous amount of work that had to be put in. And they absolutely enlisted me in that effort. And I will say I don't know if it's 50% of the time. I spent a considerable amount of my time making sure that I was up to speed and talking to our corporate customers and agencies as well. That work is paying off. It's foundational in that. Don't forget these contracts are set up over a period of time. Revenue doesn't show up right away. But we're not resting on that. We're learning from certainly the issues associated with our past strategy. And that, I believe, bodes well for the future. So, Steve, why don't you spend some time talking about progress and how you feel about where things are headed?\nSteve Johnson: Sure, Jamie. And let me start by saying I -- the team and I feel good about that. As Robert said in his opening remarks, and again, just a second ago, we're on track to achieve the commitment that he's made to fully recover our share by the end of 2025. As I said earlier, I think we can beat that. But it's not a linear process and it's kind of event-driven, if you know what I mean. We saw in the third quarter Robert's comments at Bernstein when he said that we were abandoning the old strategy that had an impact on share, we -- the restoration of content into EDIFACT had an impact on share, the engagement with our partners in the third quarter what Robert was just talking about that sometimes refer to around here as the Apology Tour, that had an impact on share. The fourth quarter was -- lots of work done in the fourth quarter, but a little bit different. And maybe that accounts for this -- the non-acceleration that you might have been looking for over the course of the last three months. But the fourth quarter task was actually infrastructure. It was making new agreements with all of our partners in the indirect community. It's an arduous task, kind of counter counterparty by counterparty. While it was going on understandably we were negotiating. So you didn't see a lot of share shift during that period of time. Indeed, some of our partners sent us even stronger messages during those negotiations. But it was ultimately successful and we now have new agreements with 30 of the most important TMCs and agencies. And as Robert said earlier, we've modified the economics for all of our significant corporate customers who were impacted by our old strategy. And as we say, and our partners say even more frequently, three airlines are better than one. And those agreements create real incentives to move business to American. And indeed the agreements with the TMCs and the agencies create real incentives to reestablish the share equilibrium that existed at the beginning of 2023. So I expect those agreements are going to be big drivers of share shift in the first and second quarter. And so you'll see continued progress.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead, Conor.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Can you hear me now?\nRobert Isom: We've got you, Conor.\nConor Cunningham: Can you hear me?\nRobert Isom: Go ahead, Conor.\nConor Cunningham: Someday I'll figure out how to use the phone. Can you -- so I'm just trying to take all this. You sound like there's upside indirect corporate share regains and then the loyalty stuff as well as just sequentially improving costs throughout the year. But your full-year guidance at the low end suggests a decline year-over-year on earnings. And I'm just trying to understand that part a little bit better? It just seems -- like are you assuming that the main cabin doesn't get any better from here? It just seems really conservative just given what we've heard from you today and what we've heard from others so far. Just trying to understand it a little bit better. Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Okay. Conor, I'll start. Devon can add in here. Look, again, we can only forecast based on what we know and what we see right now. We don't know what others are putting into their models. We've told you that we think that there's continued strength and that in terms of revenue performance, especially given the capacity that we're putting in, we see significant growth in our unit revenues. Now if there is a better overall performance in the industry, as I said, I think that we'll continue to show outperformance because of the things that we've been doing. So that's my comment in terms of questions about how is your forecast versus what the assumptions others are making. Devon, anything you want to add?\nDevon May: Yes, I'll just say midpoint of our guide is $2.20. That's up more than 10% versus what we did in 2024. There's obviously variability in earnings. We think the midpoint is what we seek to achieve. We'd like to do better than that, but we put a range of outcomes because there is still some volatility that's there and things like fuel or some amount of economic risk at a macro level. But right now we feel really good about the midpoint on the guide and it's nice year-over-year improvement and we hope to exceed that.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the Citi contract or the Citi -- the renegotiation, I'm just trying to understand that a little bit better. So the economics change in '26, but I think that there's a volume and spend-related component in '25. So can you just help bridge the contribution of how that will evolve, earnings contribution, how that evolves over that -- the change from '25 to '26? It just seems, again, like there's this potential for it to surprise. So just thoughts there. Thank you.\nSteve Johnson: Sure. Let me see if I understand the question. We will -- in our existing agreement includes minimums for new accounts and new business that Barclays and Citi have committed to. Those -- we expect them to overperform on those as part of the ramp-up into 2026. Is that helpful?\nConor Cunningham: Yes, no, that's -- that is. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Your question please, Ravi.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to start with a follow-up on the corporate normalization commentary. I think you said that you adjusted the economics for some of the biggest accounts there. Can you just unpack that a little bit more? How does the profitability of the corporate business compare to what it was before now that like or once the share is normalized?\nSteve Johnson: Sure. The adjustments -- we evolved our business with our corporate customers over the course of the last seven or eight months. We talked about this on the last earnings call. We -- some of this had to do with macro changes that we made, like reestablishing what we call corporate experience, but a certain set of unique corporate experience advantages for our traveling corporate customers employees. Waivers and favors allowing travel agents to, in certain cases, book flights or change tickets that are not completely consistent with the general rules that apply. So some of that was, I think, very helpful. But as part of the former strategy, we had created a kind of one-size-fits-all discounting system for corporations that across the board, for anyone who was impacted by that, that reduced discounts to, I think, an uncompetitive level. And so -- and that impacted about 24% of our corporate customers. Those were the ones that over the course of the strategy, their contracts came up and we were able to change them. So with respect to those customers, we've gone back, worked with them, negotiated with them, and established economics that are more consistent with the past and more competitive. In all cases, those -- the revenue from those agreements, even with a little bit better discounting, is going to be very accretive.\nRobert Isom: Yes. And Steve, I think we've said this, that when we talk about sales expense and bringing back sales team and potential impact on some of the things that we're doing, the overall cost impact is going to be less than a point of CASM. But again, all of this is going to be highly beneficial to the company.\nRavi Shanker: Great. That's a helpful explanation. And maybe as a follow-up, you guys mentioned upgraded Wi-Fi, which is great to hear. But kind of as we kind of enter like a new era of premium cabins, if you will, obviously you guys have new planes, but how do you think about bringing your own device versus screens on seats and maybe the ability to monetize those screens over time?\nRobert Isom: So Ravi, can you say that one more time? I missed a part of that question.\nRavi Shanker: So the question was kind of as we enter a new era of premium cabins, how do you guys think about bringing your own device versus having integrated screens on seats? Kind of does one versus the other kind of impact your ability to either kind of sell a premium service or monetize that screen over time?\nRobert Isom: Oh, no. So, Ravi, thanks for that question and let me talk about some of the things that we anticipate regarding product going forward. We're really pleased to announce the introduction of our new flagship suite. And that's going to be coming on the 787-9s and the A321XLRs. And one of the things you'll note is those are, let's face it, those are international aircraft, long haul. And one of the things that we're going to make sure is our customers, especially in the premium cabins and from that perspective, any international seats that they have access to screens in addition to the latest in terms of Wi-Fi and streaming entertainment. So those aircraft are going to be fully equipped. You'll see that we're doing reconfigurations on our 777-300s and adding flagship suites to that and offering more premium seating overall. Same with that. That will come with the latest in terms of technology in seatback as well. Now from a domestic perspective, we've said that we're really interested in making sure that our customers have access to Wi-Fi -- satellite-based Wi-Fi on everything that they fly. And while we can't offer it on the smallest regional jets, you note that we will have streaming Wi-Fi installed as part of our initiative this year so that all of our larger regional aircraft will have satellite-based Wi-Fi by the end of the year. And with that, once you've got that kind of comprehensive approach, it allows us to do some different offerings. So you'll hear more from us as the year progresses in terms of how we can take even better care of our customers, especially those that are the highest tier. And as well, you'll see more in terms of partnerships and relationships. Our relationship with Apple+ is really something industry record-setting and we anticipate that that is just the start of where things will go.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on your northern hub build-out. That comment kind of caught our attention. Can you talk about what inning you're in and maybe expand on how much of your footprint transitioned over to JetBlue, how much of that has transitioned back and basically what your footprint in your northern hubs looks like now versus pre-pandemic?\nRobert Isom: Look, Duane, I'll start and Steve can elaborate further. But I'll just note two, two points right off and that's LaGuardia and DCA. We're going to be back to our largest schedules, largest number of seats offered in both LaGuardia and DCA since the pandemic. And that I believe is indicative of the focus that we're putting on. And by the way, we're seeing really nice results with that added capacity. In terms of Philadelphia, that had been one of the markets that had been most difficult for us given the pull-down of regional aircraft. And the same holds true for Chicago. As we restore our regional aircraft lift, the beneficiaries of that are going to be Philadelphia and Chicago. In Philadelphia, Steve, I don't quite know the size of Philadelphia compared to prior times, but I think we're getting close to back to where we were.\nSteve Johnson: Yes, and that's the intention to have Philadelphia more or less the same size as it was pre-pandemic.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. And then I don't know if you have a metric to share, but just on how you measure competitive capacity, how do you see that in 1Q and maybe an early read on 2Q versus what you were seeing, maybe in 4Q? Thanks for taking the questions.\nRobert Isom: So, Duane, I'll start with this. Look, competitive capacity, it's important, but it's all important to the extent that it drives profitability. We're focused on margins and we're focused on making sure that we take advantage of the assets and the strengths that we have. So we're focused on that, but obviously keeping track of what's going on in the marketplace. And if there is an impact in any one of the places that we fly, we're going to adjust accordingly. The good thing about the fleet that we've built up despite the difficulties that we have with supply chain and aircraft deliveries throughout, is that we spent since the merger, $30 billion plus in terms of new aircraft. We have the youngest fleet. We don't anticipate any big retirements coming up. And we have the ability to flex this fleet in a very economic fashion should we find that conditions warrant expansion. So you'll see us with moderate growth based on expectations for this year as we get out into the latter stages 2025 and 2026. If it's -- if demand and profitability warrant an adjustment, we'll be ready to go.\nSteve Johnson: And I'd just add that to the extent that you're asking that question based on an ASM growth comparison, I just also look at the growth in departures and recognize that as we grow, we're going to have our growth in the most competitive time channels and most competitive places possible. So it's -- I don't know that ASMs is the perfect measure for comparing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your question, please Michael.\nMichael Linenberg: All right, yes. Hey, good morning. Two sort of fleet-related questions here. Just on the comment on growing your international fleet from 120 to 200 by 2029. At that point in time, how many A321neo XLRs will you have in your fleet at that point? And presumably, that's in that 200 number?\nSteve Johnson: Yes, that is in the 200 number. And we expect to have 40neos at that point.\nMichael Linenberg: Great.\nSteve Johnson: 40 -- sorry, 40 XLRs at that point.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. And then just my second question, as we think about fleets getting old, and I know your fleet is aging and we start -- and I'm more specifically wide bodies and the ability to procure wide bodies. I know economically it makes sense to procure narrow bodies from both OEMs. You guys do that. It's helped you out well with the MAXs and the 321 or 320neos. Is -- are we at a point where the decision to do that with wide-body aircraft, whether it's to procure from different OEMs or even from two different families within the same OEM, when you think about your replacement for your wide bodies, probably later this decade? Thanks for taking my question.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Mike. And I'll start. Others can chime in. I really like where we're at in terms of our fleet. We're operating the world's largest fleet of 320 family aircraft. One of the world's largest operators of 737 aircraft. We've got the MAX 8s and fortunately, those are being delivered and we've got this order out for the MAX 10s. Now, the benefit in having these large fleets and in kind of one flavor, it's really helpful from an efficiency perspective, right? We're not out there with a dozen different aircraft types. Our pilots, our flight attendants, our catering, our servicing, our maintenance, engine, supply chain, you think about it, it greatly simplifies what we're doing. We had that same philosophy from a wide-body perspective. And we love the 787 model. The 8s and then the 9s are going to be the real workhorses as we go forward. We know that our customers love it as well. As we take a look at the 777s, the 777-300s are going to be around for some time and they're going to be getting a refresh. And starting this year, we'll see the benefit of the flagship suites coming out. Those are going to be in the fleet for a long time. We've got a decision to make about a 777-200s at some point in time, whether we reconfigure or do something else. And we're in contact with Airbus, we're in contact with Boeing as well. And we're also mindful of the benefits that we get by having a simplified fleet and with fleet types that give you great flexibility depending on range and demand. And the comment about your fleet's getting older, that's true. It's just the nature of time. But the fact of the matter is we're starting from a much better spot than any of our competitors. As Devon has said, our anticipated capital spending over the long run, and this is to provide virtually any growth -- level of growth that we want, especially if we have the ability to keep older aircraft around and hold off the retirement, it is very modest. So $3.5 billion type range, as we take a look out in -- to 2026 and beyond. 2025 is a real low spot in terms of capital spending. So we already have the lowest average age for our fleet. We don't have retirements coming up. And I see that as others have to invest in their fleet and they're talking about numbers that are more than double of those kind of capital expenditures and the difficulty, and -- at least with delivery of aircraft these days, I really like where we're at.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your question please, Brandon.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the question. Robert, I guess if you step back, I mean, because obviously so much has changed in the past year, especially since the Investor Day, I think, in March of last year. But obviously, you've talked about a lot getting corporate share back. But how would you articulate American's commercial strategy going forward today? And I guess I'm just observing here, but it feels like maybe you're still in a zone of defense. When does that then transition into an offensive front with that strategy?\nRobert Isom: Thanks for that question. And our Investor Day commitments, we stand by them. I don't like that we're not -- we haven't grown margins. And as I take a look out into the future, and as Devon has said, I do believe that we're set up well to grow margins, especially because of everything that we've done from an efficiency perspective. Now, I'm going to get back to the other side of that equation because it's not just a cost perspective, but you combine the record free cash flow production that we produce, we've done a really nice job of getting this airline set up so that we're not worried about balance sheet issues. And that puts us in a very different position. I've talked to you about our fleet, and as we take a look going forward, you are going to see this year American absolutely spend a lot more time in focus and energy in terms of improving our customer experience in a way that we can monetize. So from that perspective, we have a foundation built that I think others are trying to catch up on, whether it's establishment of satellite Wi-Fi across all fleets, ultra-premium lounges, which we're going to be introducing, a new Philadelphia lounge to add to the complement that we already have. This collection of premium seating on our aircraft. And whether it's the new flagship suites on 787-8s or 787-9s and the XLRs, or whether it's just the domestic product where we're so strong, we have a regional product that others can't touch in terms of the E175s. And in terms of the rest of the fleet, you'll see that the older aircraft that we have, whether it's the 320s and 319s, they're going to be both getting upgraded. And so I feel like we have all the pieces of the puzzle in place to really take off. Now, we've got some work to do putting that together and selling and telling our story better. But we are the largest in the best market in the world here in the U.S. We've got an enviable position in the biggest business market. When you think about London, Heathrow and Tokyo, we've got the best set of partners around the world in those biggest markets. American's got a lot of momentum as we look forward.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate that, Robert. And then, Devon, I know you talked a lot about the cost headwinds this year, but is there any productivity offsets potentially in these new labor agreements and especially in the context of that simplified fleet that Robert was just discussing?\nRobert Isom: Not necessarily offsets related to the labor agreements themselves. I think the offsets we're finding is just a lot of work on efficiency and investing in the right technologies. As we've talked about last year, our reengineering the business efforts generated about $500 million in value. This year, we think we're going to generate a couple hundred million dollars, but that's net of some really meaningful investments that we're making in our IT shop that we're making in our TechOps organization to digitalize all the work that they are doing. So I feel great about the investments we're making. It doesn't all necessarily pay back in this calendar year, but we look out to 2026. I think our cost profile is going to look really good. I've always said, I look back over the last several years, I think we've performed better than anybody when it comes to unit cost delivery. So we're not necessarily seeing anything in labor agreements. That's not what we were going after in those labor agreements. But we are running a more efficient business right now, and I think we're going to run a more efficient business a year from now than we are today.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be taking questions from media. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal. Your question please, Alison.\nAlison Sider: Hey, thanks so much. Curious after the starship breakup last week, how concerned are you about sort of the operational and safety impacts from space launches? And is there anything you're asking the FAA to do differently in terms of kind of how it handles those?\nRobert Isom: Well, Allie, thanks for the question. We're in constant contact with DOT and FAA. And no doubt launches do have an impact on our network, especially given the airspace issues that are impacted. So what we do, we coordinate closely. I've got David Seymour here, our Chief Operating Officer. And what he'll -- I think what he'll tell you is that we -- the coordination efforts is better than it's ever been and that one of the things we try to do is work with any launches to make sure that they're as least impactful in terms of time of day that they take place. Dave, you want to add anything?\nDavid Seymour: Yes, I think, Robert, you said the right things in our coordination with them. And I think it's just -- the FAA is going to be very mindful of those launches and they executed their strategy in locking out a containment zone for that launch. And it was disruptive to us in terms of diversions that we had to do, holding aircraft on the ground, but we recovered well. But as Robert said, the coordination right now that we have with the FAA and air traffic side has never been better. And we're going to continue to work with them on that.\nAlison Sider: Got it. I mean, do you know, or is there anything you want to be done differently for future launches in terms of the sort of perimeter for the closed airspace or the timing of launches or anything you're looking to change from a safety perspective?\nDavid Seymour: We're still waiting for the FAA to continue their review of that but on the surface right now, I don't see anything different that we're going to see. They've done a lot of work over the last several years of actually continuing to manage that. So we have not as impacted as we were in the past, but we're going to work with them. But I think they need to continue their review of that situation and then we'll get back and see if we need to adjust plans.\nAlison Sider: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg News. Your question please, Mary.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the IFE on the premium cabins that you're talking about going forward. I'm wondering what was the -- what's been responsible for that shift in your approach on IFE. It's just competitive pressure, something that consumers are demanding or what's behind that?\nRobert Isom: Oh, hey, Mary, just -- you might have mistaken something. In terms of our IFE strategy, in-flight seatback entertainment on our international based wide-body aircraft or in the case of the 321XLRs, those will be equipped to take care of our customers. The rest of our fleet will have satellite-based Wi-Fi, except for the smallest of the regional jets.\nMary Schlangenstein: Right. But you don't currently have IFE on your international wide-bodies, or am I wrong on that?\nRobert Isom: We currently have IFE on our international-based aircraft.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. Sorry about that. And the other question I wanted to ask was what changes that you potentially foresee from the Trump administration in terms of either the operations of the FAA and ATC issues with them trying to step up hiring or make changes faster than the past administration had to change the ATC issues affecting the airlines?\nRobert Isom: Well, as I said in some earlier comments, I think President Trump and the administration, they recognize the importance of aviation to commerce. They certainly did that during the first Trump administration in response to COVID and the support that was provided to the industry. It's a reason why the industry is as strong as it is today. And credit really does go to the first Trump administration and the quick reaction. Now in regard to what we do next, I do believe that it's imperative that we look at investing in air traffic control. We know that there's a huge tax put on efficiency for the airlines on our customers in terms of the time it takes to fly. And ultimately we've got to address it because there's a lot of growth that I think is possible and hoped for in the industry. But we can't keep on jamming more aircraft into the skies in a way that can't be serviced efficiently. So today, it takes a lot longer to fly from Chicago to New York or Washington to New York than it did 20 years ago. There's no reason for that. There's plenty of room in the sky. There's technology that we can be deploying that would be helpful from an overall control perspective. And also our aircraft are actually equipped to handle and to perform in a different system. So we've got a lot of work to do. It's going to take investment, but I have great confidence that that will be the type of work that we're able to engage on. And the last thing I'll just say is I also believe that the administration will be very cognizant of regulatory issues that can benefit both the airlines and our customers as well. And we'll be working closely with them on that. So I'm very, very optimistic about the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Please go ahead, Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just considering what the Trump administration has said about DEI and how they're extending that ordering changes within the federal government. I was curious where American Airlines stands. I see the website says DEI are foundational to American Airlines' culture and that you plan to lead the industry with DEI. Any changes there internally and do you have any concerns about the review at the FAA that the federal government is doing? Thanks.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Leslie. I can't speak to anything going on at the FAA. I'll just say that at American, we've always had a philosophy of hiring the best team members that we can possibly bring into the company. We serve 650,000 plus on peak days customers -- 650,000 plus customers of all backgrounds and places throughout the world. We have 130,000 team members that work in all parts of the globe. Our efforts here are going to be focused on caring for people on life's journey. And in that, we're going to do that in a way that's it's -- that's beneficial for our customers and profitable for our airline. That's going to be our guiding factor as we go forward in looking for ways to better take care of our customers and better take care of our team members. That's front and center. And that is where American is headed.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Latif. I appreciate everybody's interest and time today. And I'd just like to reiterate that the fourth quarter was a quarter for us in which we laid down some incredibly important milestones. It was important for us to outperform the industry in terms of revenue production year-over-year. It was important for us to achieve record free cash flow that put us in place to take advantage of a lot of other things that we've been doing in this company to make sure that our balance sheet is as strong as possible. And we're excited about the challenges that we've taken on, not only to restore our revenue performance, but also to expand upon that and take advantage of everything that we've built in this airline over the last several years. And so I'll reiterate our commitment to our customers to take care of them in the best possible fashion, and then I'll also reiterate our commitment to our investors. We are intent on growing margins, producing sustainable free cash flow, further continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. And there's a tremendous amount of upside in American right now. When you take a look at our performance and what we're capable of doing as we look out into 2025 and going into 2026, American is poised to outperform. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, American reported a fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax profit of $808 million or an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.86, above the high end of the guidance we issued in early December. For the full-year, we reported an adjusted pre-tax profit of $1.8 billion or an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.96. I want to thank the American Airlines team for a great year and for their resiliency, continued hard work and dedication to delivering a safe and reliable operation for our customers. As I've said previously, at American, we're focused on delivering results. As we closed out 2024, we achieved a number of notable milestones. With the ratification of a contract extension with our mechanics and fleet service team members in October, we now have multi-year agreements in place with all of our largest work groups, providing labor cost certainty through 2027. We delivered nearly $500 million of value through our reengineering initiatives, nearly $100 million more than expected. We announced a new 10-year agreement with Citi to become the exclusive issuer of the AAdvantage co-branded credit card portfolio in the United States, which we expect will drive substantial incremental value to American over the life of the agreement, while unlocking even more value for AAdvantage members. We generated record free cash flow of $2.2 billion in 2024. And I'm excited to report that as of the end of 2024, we have reduced our total debt by more than $15 billion from peak levels in mid-2021, achieving our initial debt reduction goal a full-year ahead of schedule. While there's still much work to do, these accomplishments are clear evidence that the American Airlines team is committed to delivering results and achieving our stated objectives. Now, on to our fourth quarter performance. Total revenue grew 4.6% on 2.5% higher capacity year-over-year. This resulted in our unit revenue inflecting positive in the quarter, up 2% year-over-year and above the high-end of our December guidance. Passenger revenue strength throughout the fourth quarter was broad-based. In the fourth quarter, American's year-over-year Domestic, Atlantic, Pacific and total passenger unit revenue results led U.S. network carriers. While Latin unit revenue was down on a year-over-year basis, we expect short-haul Latin year-over-year unit revenue to be positive in the first quarter. This strong performance is the result of the actions we have taken and we're encouraged by the trends we see early in the year. Demand for American's product remains strong as evidenced by the continued strength of our business, premium and loyalty revenue performance. In the fourth quarter, managed business revenue was, up 8% year-over-year, a sequential improvement of 2 points versus last quarter and we continue to see yield strength as we look ahead into the new year. Premium revenue increased approximately 8% year-over-year. Paid load factor in our premium cabins remains historically high and was up 3 points year-over-year with strength in both Domestic and International. In the fourth quarter, loyalty revenues were up approximately 14% year-over-year with AAdvantage members responsible for 75% of premium cabin revenue. 2024 was a record year for AAdvantage. Throughout the year, we had a record number of customers enrolled in the program with members earning and burning more miles than any year in our history. Spending on our co-branded credit cards was up 9.5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, further highlighting the value of our loyalty program. American is proud to have an industry-leading travel rewards program that is frequently acknowledged as providing the best value for its members. Finally, we remain committed to providing a leading customer experience, especially for our premium customers. We're excited to introduce our new state-of-the-art flagship suite on our new Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A321XLR aircraft later this year. Over the course of the next four years, we expect to grow our long-haul international capable fleet from approximately 125 aircraft today to nearly 200 aircraft in 2029. Additionally, American has led the way in introducing premium lounges and we're on track to open our fifth flagship lounge this summer in Philadelphia, which marks the ninth premium lounge across the system. In the fourth quarter, we introduced boarding automation as a first step to improving the boarding process and customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. American was the first airline to offer streaming entertainment on our mainline fleet, and we're proud to offer high-speed Wi-Fi on more aircraft than any other domestic airline. In December, we began the installation of high-speed satellite Wi-Fi on our dual-class regional aircraft. We expect the entire fleet will be retrofitted by the end of this year. Additionally, we're in the process of redesigning our mobile app, making it easier to navigate and to provide more self-service options for our customers. Building on these customer-focused initiatives is one of our top priorities and we'll have more to share in the months ahead. Momentum in recovering revenue from indirect channels continued in the fourth quarter and we remain on track to fully restore our revenue share from indirect channels as we exit this year. Our indirect flown revenue share improvement was driven by sequential gains in corporate revenue share, which has been the primary focus of our recovery efforts. Importantly, forward bookings continue to show strength into the first quarter. As we enter the new year, we're in position to continue recovering share in indirect channels. We've completed new contracts with all of our agency partners that serve our corporate customers and agreed to new agreements with the leisure agencies that serve our most profitable leisure customers. Additionally, we've reviewed and reworked agreements with our corporate customers most affected by the previous strategy and largely restored share of those travelers in our hub markets. Completing these steps provides a strong foundation for us to continue to compete for that business and restore our share in these important distribution channels and with those customers. Last year, we took steps to further grow and optimize AAdvantage. In December, we announced a 10-year agreement with Citi to become the exclusive issuer of the AAdvantage co-branded credit card portfolio in the U.S. American has had a partnership with Citi for more than 37-years. The strength of that partnership has enabled us to deliver first-class products and customer service to millions of AAdvantage card members and we're excited to continue to partner with Citi. Our 2024 cash from co-branded credit cards and other partners was $6.1 billion, an increase of 17% versus 2023. The 2024 amount includes a one-time cash payment received in the fourth quarter related to our new credit card agreement. As we disclosed at the time of the announcement, we expect the agreement set to begin in 2026 will enable cash payments from our co-branded credit card and other partners to grow by approximately 10% annually. As annual cash payments from co-branded credit card and other partners approaches $10 billion, we expect annual pre-tax income will benefit by approximately $1.5 billion, compared to 2024. Our expanded partnership with Citi will unlock more value and provide exciting new benefits to our customers. With the agreement completed, the teams have turned toward building the business and we look forward to making several exciting announcements over the coming year. Turning now to our operation. Thanks to the resiliency of the American Airlines team, we delivered another quarter of strong results, despite a difficult operating environment. Operational disruptions are part of the airline business. And in American, we continue to show that operational resiliency and rapid recovery are part of our DNA. In the fourth quarter, American ranked second in completion factor and on-time departures among the four largest U.S., carriers. For the year, we achieved our second-best completion factor since the merger, carrying our largest-ever volume of passengers. Looking ahead, continued investment in the operation and the technology that supports it will drive further improvements in our operating reliability and resiliency. In closing, we've achieved a number of important objectives in 2024 and our performance in the fourth quarter shows what this team and what this airline are capable of. That foundation and the momentum we've built will serve us well in 2025. Before I turn the call over to Devon, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge those impacted by the devastating wildfires in Southern California. Our hearts go out to those communities. American's AAdvantage members and team members have donated more than $1.7 million in funds to the American Red Cross to support relief efforts, and we've donated supplies and care packages to families and firefighters in the Los Angeles area. And with that, I'll turn it over to Devon to share more about our fourth quarter and full year financial results and our outlook for 2025.\nDevon May: Thank you, Robert. Excluding net special items, we reported a fourth quarter net income of $609 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.86. We produced record fourth quarter revenue of $13.7 billion, up 4.6% year-over-year with unit revenue up 2% year-over-year. Fourth quarter unit cost, excluding fuel and net special items, was up 5.7% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDAR margin was 14.9% and we produced an adjusted operating margin of 8.4%. In 2024, we achieved nearly $500 million of savings from our reengineering the business initiatives, exceeding our goal by nearly $100 million. Most of the value in 2024 was due to better workforce management driven by process improvements and technology implementation, along with improved asset utilization and procurement savings. We also had nearly $350 million of working capital cash release, which exceeded our expectations and helped drive our 2024 free cash flow performance. We remain focused on running the airline as efficiently as possible, while enhancing the customer experience. Moving to our fleet. In 2024, we took delivery of 20 new aircraft and 10 used aircraft resulting in $1.9 billion of aircraft CapEx. Total CapEx for 2024 came in at $2.7 billion. Looking ahead, we expect to take delivery of 40 to 50 new aircraft in 2025. Based on our current expectation for new deliveries, our 2025 aircraft CapEx, which also includes used aircraft purchases, spare engines and net PDPs, is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion and our total CapEx is expected to be between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. We continue to expect moderate levels of CapEx moving forward with aircraft CapEx averaging between $3 billion and $3.5 billion for the remainder of the decade. We ended 2024 with $10.3 billion of total available liquidity and produced record free cash flow of $2.2 billion. During the fourth quarter, we prepaid $750 million of near-term debt maturities and strategically repriced two term loans. We ended the year with total debt of $38.6 billion and net debt of $31.6 billion, our lowest level of net debt since 2015. With these actions, we achieved our total debt reduction goal of $15 billion from peak levels in mid-2021 a full-year ahead of schedule. We are thrilled to have delivered on this commitment and we remain focused on continuing to strengthen our balance sheet as we work toward our stated credit rating goal of BB. Previously, we committed to reducing total debt to less than $35 billion by year-end 2028. We are now committing to achieve that goal by the end of 2027. Now on to the outlook for 2025. In the first quarter, we expect capacity to be flat to down 2% year-over-year. This capacity is driven by lower capacity in the off-peak months of January and February, which combined are down approximately 3%, followed by growth of 3% to 4% in the peak travel period in March. We continue to expect full-year capacity to be up low-single-digits, in line with expected economic growth and our prior guidance. Our growth in 2025 is focused on improving our schedule in markets that are not yet fully restored to historical levels, primarily in our Northern hubs. We expect our year-over-year capacity growth rates to be fairly balanced between Domestic and International operations. We will remain flexible and will adjust capacity in response to demand and the competitive environment in which we operate. We expect first quarter revenue to be up 3% to 5% and for the full-year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 4.5% to 7.5% versus 2024. This is driven by continued indirect revenue recapture, strong demand for our product and a constructive industry backdrop with supply in line with expected demand. First quarter non-fuel unit costs are expected to be up high-single-digits year-over-year. This unit cost growth is driven by the reduction in year-over-year capacity, the mix of that capacity and the new collective bargaining agreements that were reached in the second-half of 2024. In the first quarter, regional ASMs will be up approximately 17% as we return to full utilization and mainline capacity will be down 2% to 3%. Based on the timing of our labor agreements and the shape of capacity, we expect unit costs to improve sequentially throughout the year from high-single-digits in the first quarter to low-single-digits as we exit the year. For the full-year, we expect non-fuel unit cost to be up mid-single-digits year-over-year with a large majority of the cost growth coming from higher salaries and benefits. As we look out to 2026, we have certainty in our labor costs and the rate pressure from our new collective bargaining agreements will ease. We expect that in 2026 our year-over-year growth of our salaries and benefits per ASM will be well inside of inflation. We continue to focus on reengineering the business to become more efficient. Through best-in-class workforce management, efficient asset utilization and procurement transformation, we expect more than $200 million of incremental cost savings in 2025. Additionally, we are investing in a multi-year transformation in our IT and TechOps organizations to modernize technology, improve operations and optimize staffing costs. We anticipate continuing to productively utilize our workforce with mainline full-time employee counts staying approximately flat to 2024. This year, we also expect more than $100 million in additional working capital improvements. Based on our current demand assumptions and fuel price forecast, we expect a first quarter loss of approximately $0.20 to $0.40 per diluted share. For the full-year, we are expecting to deliver adjusted earnings per diluted share of approximately $1.70 to $2.70. We expect another year of record free cash flow generation in 2025 and are currently forecasting more than $2 billion of free cash flow for the full-year. Now, I'll turn it back to Robert for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Devon. As we start 2025, the long-term targets we outlined last March remain our focus, growing margins, generating sustainable free cash flow and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. Our priorities for this year will continue the momentum we built in the back half of last year and further our progress toward achieving our long-term targets. In 2025, we plan to operate with excellence and efficiently deliver a safe and reliable operation, take a fresh look at our product and service as we sharpen our focus on the customer experience, continue to strengthen our network, both organically and through our airline partnerships. Our December announcement with Citi was an important milestone for American. It will allow us to enhance AAdvantage and further strengthen our leading travel awards and co-branded credit card program ecosystem. All of these priorities, including the restoration of our core sales and distribution initiatives, will allow us to deliver on our revenue potential and we'll continue our work to reengineer the business as we build a more efficient airline. We know that by delivering on our commitments, we'll unlock significant value for our shareholders. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] [Technical Difficulty] line of Catherine. Your line is open, Catherine.\nCatherine O'Brien: Good morning everyone, thanks so much for the time. So, you know, we don't know exactly what low-single-digit capacity growth means for the year, but if I just use 2%, that means the RASM growth is about 4% for the year versus the 5% of getting in 1Q on your guidance. You know, I understand capacity growth accelerates over the year, but can you talk about your assumptions on indirect revenue improvement and the industry outlook underlying that full-year guide? And just really wondering like what could go better than your base case?\nRobert Isom: So, Catherine, thanks. I'll start on our expectations for indirect revenue recovery, and Devon can speak to capacity, and Steve can add anything that he thinks is important as well. We're on track for recovering what we had lost. I feel really good about the progress we've made in a short six month period. And as we take a look, and you can see from our notes, as we take a look at forward bookings, it really suggests that we've got traction in the marketplace. So I have great confidence that we're going to recover fully as we move through the year. And then, you know, I just also, you know, note this, that we also believe that from a revenue performance perspective, even outside of indirect channels, we think that we're poised to perform and outperform. You saw it in our fourth quarter results and I can't speak to others assumptions, but in an environment where the economy is improving, I think that we're going to improve faster than our largest competitors. Devon?\nDevon May: Yes, I don't think there's any big moves in the quarterly capacity numbers. We guided the first quarter which will be down 0% to 2%. The remaining quarters will probably be all up in the neighborhood of 3% per quarter in terms of ASM capacity, which gets you about to that midpoint on low-single-digit capacity for the year.\nCatherine O'Brien: Got it.\nSteve Johnson: Catherine, this is Steve. I'll just follow up with you. You asked about sources of potential upside from our base case. I'll just offer three. First, I think that there's a decent chance that we could restore our sales and distribution -- restore sales and distribution revenue faster than Robert's by the end of 2025. I think that's an upside. Second, I would point you to both the third quarter and especially the fourth quarter. Ultimately we're going to be judged on everything and certainly revenue by our results. And I think the fourth quarter shows what we're capable of. And then finally I'd just point to our agreement with Citi. The new agreement doesn't start until 2026 and so the growth that we focus on from -- won't start until then. But there is -- to get to that there is a ramp-up effort underway that I think could provide upside in co-brand revenue during the year.\nCatherine O'Brien: That's great. Thanks for that additional color, Steve. Devon, maybe one more for you. As you've reached your medium-term debt goal, can you speak to how you're thinking about capital allocation between now and that longer-term goal in 2027? Understand you have more deleveraging to do to hit that 2027 goal. And then you mentioned a BB credit rating. But what's the gating factor to consider shareholder return? Thanks so much for all the time.\nDevon May: Hey, thanks, Katie. Well, I'll just start. We are really proud of achieving the $15 billion goal that we set out to do two or three years ago at this point and we achieved it a year early. But our focus still remains on improving the balance sheet. We've set another near-term goal here to have it -- total debt down another $4 billion to around $35 billion by 2027. So we'll focus on that. We'll continue to focus on reinvesting in the business. And as we continue to improve free cash flow and improve the balance sheet, we'll come back and talk more about other capital allocation priorities.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Your question please, Connor. Our next question comes from the line of Connor Cunningham of Melius Research. Your line is open, Connor. Conor, please make sure your line isn't muted, and if you have a speakerphone lift your handset. We'll go to the next question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your question please, Scott.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So Devon, I think you laid out CASM going from high-singles to start the year towards low-singles ending the year. It doesn't seem like guidance implies a big deceleration in RASM throughout the year. So can you just talk about how you see the progression of price cost on a net basis trending throughout the year?\nDevon May: Well, I'll just start by talking a little bit about our cost performance, because right now we are seeing some more pressure in the first quarter than we are during the rest of the year. So to start, we are really proud of our cost performance over the last several years. I'm excited about what the company is doing to reengineer the business and drive more efficiencies. I think we're making really nice investments in technology. The operations team is really leaning into this and I think we're delivering a more efficient operation, better operation for our customers. In the first quarter, though, we are seeing unit costs up high-single-digits. It's a handful of things. We have less capacity in the first quarter than we did a year ago. That starts to change as we grow capacity in the last three quarters of the year. We have a ton of regional capacity coming online. As you know that's higher cost capacity than the mainline capacity. It's actually driving average gauge to be down 4% to 5% in the first quarter year-over-year. Stage length is down as well. And then of course, the labor agreements that were signed in the back half of last year weren't in our base for this year. So we see a lot of cost pressure in the first quarter. It eases throughout the year. We feel we're incredibly well-positioned as we get into 2026. And we know we run the business as efficiently as anybody. On the margin side, I don't think there's any quarter that show outsized margin improvement year-over-year. We've guided EPS to a midpoint of $2.20. So we are seeing nice EPS improvement year-over-year. But I don't think you're going to see any one quarter pop really materially versus what we perform -- or versus how we performed in 2024.\nScott Group: Okay. And then can you just talk about maybe the progression of RASM throughout Q4 and then just regionally how you see RASM playing out in Q1? Like Transatlantic was up 12% in Q4. Can that sustain itself in the near-term? Just any regional color? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Well, Scott, thanks for that. I'd just point to the fourth quarter in which we had strong performance across the board. So Atlantic, Pacific and then also Domestic in terms of year-over-year improvement, led our network competitors and overall we led it as well. As we take a look out into this year, I see continued strength domestically and the strong dollar is absolutely going to have an impact on buying and travel to Europe this summer. So we take a look to March and as we look to some of our peak periods, spring break and getting into the summer, I see robust demand across the board. We've talked about premium traffic as being wind behind our sales and also something that I think that we're going to be able to do even better in. And Steve mentioned some of the things that are going to be additive as well in terms of potential for even better performance. So overall, really confident about the year and like what we see and how we can operate in this environment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. So an interesting statistic that United throughout yesterday was that the margin gap between its best and worst performing hubs had narrowed to, I guess, the lowest gap in, I think, it was nine or 10-years. We've discussed American's relative hub performance on these calls and in person for quite some time, but I never asked about the range. Would you be willing to comment on that margin range between your top and bottom hubs and whether it's improving or widening? Obviously, a lot of moving pieces in many of your hubs at the moment. Thanks.\nRobert Isom: Okay. Hey, thanks, Jamie. And I'll start. Devon and Steve can add in. Look, it's no secret that we've had to build back our network and we have a large portion of our network that is supported by our regional fleet. I feel great that in 2025 we're going to have our regional fleet fully deployed. And what that's going to allow us to do is better fill out some of the hubs that, quite frankly, are ready and I think willing to support the network in a different way. But we've got to put the capacity there. So you're going to see the largest schedules that we've ever had in places like DFW in Charlotte, Miami in its peak, will be bigger than it's ever been. DCA, which had been a laggard coming out of the pandemic, is now getting back to the performance levels that we had hoped. And we've talked about some of the work that we're going to be in Chicago. So across the board, we see performance improving. Some of the weaker points in our network as we take a look to the coast in New York and out in Los Angeles, I'd say this, that the schedule changes that we've made in LaGuardia, the largest schedule that we've run since the pandemic I believe just as we closed out the fourth quarter, we're really seeing nice results in terms of where we put that capacity. And so from that perspective, I believe that we have improved considerably our New York performance. And I hope and have confidence that that will be something that we can maintain going forward. In Los Angeles, from that perspective, there are some capacity restrictions, but on that front, that's one where we really do partner well with our Oneworld partner, Alaska Airlines, and we look forward to continuing that progress. So when you take a look at American, you've always known that DFW, Charlotte, DCA and now DCA getting back into the ranks have performed well. Philadelphia is getting back to where it should be. Phoenix is -- has historically been strong. And then as I mentioned, we've got a focus on the coasts in Chicago.\nJamie Baker: Yes. That's helpful. And then while I have you, Robert, when I last saw you, which I think was in September, you mentioned you were spending half your time on efforts to reconcile with corporate accounts. And I think you said that publicly in a -- at a conference or two. And I don't know if you actually meant precisely 50% or if that was just sort of metaphorical. But by the way you describe the effort in your prepared remarks makes it sound like most of that effort is behind you. Is that the right interpretation? I guess I'm just confused on exactly where American is on the reconciliation front and how managed corporate recovery trends from here. Thanks in advance.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Jamie. Look, I will give a ton of credit to our commercial team led by Steve Johnson for the enormous amount of work that had to be put in. And they absolutely enlisted me in that effort. And I will say I don't know if it's 50% of the time. I spent a considerable amount of my time making sure that I was up to speed and talking to our corporate customers and agencies as well. That work is paying off. It's foundational in that. Don't forget these contracts are set up over a period of time. Revenue doesn't show up right away. But we're not resting on that. We're learning from certainly the issues associated with our past strategy. And that, I believe, bodes well for the future. So, Steve, why don't you spend some time talking about progress and how you feel about where things are headed?\nSteve Johnson: Sure, Jamie. And let me start by saying I -- the team and I feel good about that. As Robert said in his opening remarks, and again, just a second ago, we're on track to achieve the commitment that he's made to fully recover our share by the end of 2025. As I said earlier, I think we can beat that. But it's not a linear process and it's kind of event-driven, if you know what I mean. We saw in the third quarter Robert's comments at Bernstein when he said that we were abandoning the old strategy that had an impact on share, we -- the restoration of content into EDIFACT had an impact on share, the engagement with our partners in the third quarter what Robert was just talking about that sometimes refer to around here as the Apology Tour, that had an impact on share. The fourth quarter was -- lots of work done in the fourth quarter, but a little bit different. And maybe that accounts for this -- the non-acceleration that you might have been looking for over the course of the last three months. But the fourth quarter task was actually infrastructure. It was making new agreements with all of our partners in the indirect community. It's an arduous task, kind of counter counterparty by counterparty. While it was going on understandably we were negotiating. So you didn't see a lot of share shift during that period of time. Indeed, some of our partners sent us even stronger messages during those negotiations. But it was ultimately successful and we now have new agreements with 30 of the most important TMCs and agencies. And as Robert said earlier, we've modified the economics for all of our significant corporate customers who were impacted by our old strategy. And as we say, and our partners say even more frequently, three airlines are better than one. And those agreements create real incentives to move business to American. And indeed the agreements with the TMCs and the agencies create real incentives to reestablish the share equilibrium that existed at the beginning of 2023. So I expect those agreements are going to be big drivers of share shift in the first and second quarter. And so you'll see continued progress.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead, Conor.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Can you hear me now?\nRobert Isom: We've got you, Conor.\nConor Cunningham: Can you hear me?\nRobert Isom: Go ahead, Conor.\nConor Cunningham: Someday I'll figure out how to use the phone. Can you -- so I'm just trying to take all this. You sound like there's upside indirect corporate share regains and then the loyalty stuff as well as just sequentially improving costs throughout the year. But your full-year guidance at the low end suggests a decline year-over-year on earnings. And I'm just trying to understand that part a little bit better? It just seems -- like are you assuming that the main cabin doesn't get any better from here? It just seems really conservative just given what we've heard from you today and what we've heard from others so far. Just trying to understand it a little bit better. Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Okay. Conor, I'll start. Devon can add in here. Look, again, we can only forecast based on what we know and what we see right now. We don't know what others are putting into their models. We've told you that we think that there's continued strength and that in terms of revenue performance, especially given the capacity that we're putting in, we see significant growth in our unit revenues. Now if there is a better overall performance in the industry, as I said, I think that we'll continue to show outperformance because of the things that we've been doing. So that's my comment in terms of questions about how is your forecast versus what the assumptions others are making. Devon, anything you want to add?\nDevon May: Yes, I'll just say midpoint of our guide is $2.20. That's up more than 10% versus what we did in 2024. There's obviously variability in earnings. We think the midpoint is what we seek to achieve. We'd like to do better than that, but we put a range of outcomes because there is still some volatility that's there and things like fuel or some amount of economic risk at a macro level. But right now we feel really good about the midpoint on the guide and it's nice year-over-year improvement and we hope to exceed that.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the Citi contract or the Citi -- the renegotiation, I'm just trying to understand that a little bit better. So the economics change in '26, but I think that there's a volume and spend-related component in '25. So can you just help bridge the contribution of how that will evolve, earnings contribution, how that evolves over that -- the change from '25 to '26? It just seems, again, like there's this potential for it to surprise. So just thoughts there. Thank you.\nSteve Johnson: Sure. Let me see if I understand the question. We will -- in our existing agreement includes minimums for new accounts and new business that Barclays and Citi have committed to. Those -- we expect them to overperform on those as part of the ramp-up into 2026. Is that helpful?\nConor Cunningham: Yes, no, that's -- that is. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Your question please, Ravi.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to start with a follow-up on the corporate normalization commentary. I think you said that you adjusted the economics for some of the biggest accounts there. Can you just unpack that a little bit more? How does the profitability of the corporate business compare to what it was before now that like or once the share is normalized?\nSteve Johnson: Sure. The adjustments -- we evolved our business with our corporate customers over the course of the last seven or eight months. We talked about this on the last earnings call. We -- some of this had to do with macro changes that we made, like reestablishing what we call corporate experience, but a certain set of unique corporate experience advantages for our traveling corporate customers employees. Waivers and favors allowing travel agents to, in certain cases, book flights or change tickets that are not completely consistent with the general rules that apply. So some of that was, I think, very helpful. But as part of the former strategy, we had created a kind of one-size-fits-all discounting system for corporations that across the board, for anyone who was impacted by that, that reduced discounts to, I think, an uncompetitive level. And so -- and that impacted about 24% of our corporate customers. Those were the ones that over the course of the strategy, their contracts came up and we were able to change them. So with respect to those customers, we've gone back, worked with them, negotiated with them, and established economics that are more consistent with the past and more competitive. In all cases, those -- the revenue from those agreements, even with a little bit better discounting, is going to be very accretive.\nRobert Isom: Yes. And Steve, I think we've said this, that when we talk about sales expense and bringing back sales team and potential impact on some of the things that we're doing, the overall cost impact is going to be less than a point of CASM. But again, all of this is going to be highly beneficial to the company.\nRavi Shanker: Great. That's a helpful explanation. And maybe as a follow-up, you guys mentioned upgraded Wi-Fi, which is great to hear. But kind of as we kind of enter like a new era of premium cabins, if you will, obviously you guys have new planes, but how do you think about bringing your own device versus screens on seats and maybe the ability to monetize those screens over time?\nRobert Isom: So Ravi, can you say that one more time? I missed a part of that question.\nRavi Shanker: So the question was kind of as we enter a new era of premium cabins, how do you guys think about bringing your own device versus having integrated screens on seats? Kind of does one versus the other kind of impact your ability to either kind of sell a premium service or monetize that screen over time?\nRobert Isom: Oh, no. So, Ravi, thanks for that question and let me talk about some of the things that we anticipate regarding product going forward. We're really pleased to announce the introduction of our new flagship suite. And that's going to be coming on the 787-9s and the A321XLRs. And one of the things you'll note is those are, let's face it, those are international aircraft, long haul. And one of the things that we're going to make sure is our customers, especially in the premium cabins and from that perspective, any international seats that they have access to screens in addition to the latest in terms of Wi-Fi and streaming entertainment. So those aircraft are going to be fully equipped. You'll see that we're doing reconfigurations on our 777-300s and adding flagship suites to that and offering more premium seating overall. Same with that. That will come with the latest in terms of technology in seatback as well. Now from a domestic perspective, we've said that we're really interested in making sure that our customers have access to Wi-Fi -- satellite-based Wi-Fi on everything that they fly. And while we can't offer it on the smallest regional jets, you note that we will have streaming Wi-Fi installed as part of our initiative this year so that all of our larger regional aircraft will have satellite-based Wi-Fi by the end of the year. And with that, once you've got that kind of comprehensive approach, it allows us to do some different offerings. So you'll hear more from us as the year progresses in terms of how we can take even better care of our customers, especially those that are the highest tier. And as well, you'll see more in terms of partnerships and relationships. Our relationship with Apple+ is really something industry record-setting and we anticipate that that is just the start of where things will go.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on your northern hub build-out. That comment kind of caught our attention. Can you talk about what inning you're in and maybe expand on how much of your footprint transitioned over to JetBlue, how much of that has transitioned back and basically what your footprint in your northern hubs looks like now versus pre-pandemic?\nRobert Isom: Look, Duane, I'll start and Steve can elaborate further. But I'll just note two, two points right off and that's LaGuardia and DCA. We're going to be back to our largest schedules, largest number of seats offered in both LaGuardia and DCA since the pandemic. And that I believe is indicative of the focus that we're putting on. And by the way, we're seeing really nice results with that added capacity. In terms of Philadelphia, that had been one of the markets that had been most difficult for us given the pull-down of regional aircraft. And the same holds true for Chicago. As we restore our regional aircraft lift, the beneficiaries of that are going to be Philadelphia and Chicago. In Philadelphia, Steve, I don't quite know the size of Philadelphia compared to prior times, but I think we're getting close to back to where we were.\nSteve Johnson: Yes, and that's the intention to have Philadelphia more or less the same size as it was pre-pandemic.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. And then I don't know if you have a metric to share, but just on how you measure competitive capacity, how do you see that in 1Q and maybe an early read on 2Q versus what you were seeing, maybe in 4Q? Thanks for taking the questions.\nRobert Isom: So, Duane, I'll start with this. Look, competitive capacity, it's important, but it's all important to the extent that it drives profitability. We're focused on margins and we're focused on making sure that we take advantage of the assets and the strengths that we have. So we're focused on that, but obviously keeping track of what's going on in the marketplace. And if there is an impact in any one of the places that we fly, we're going to adjust accordingly. The good thing about the fleet that we've built up despite the difficulties that we have with supply chain and aircraft deliveries throughout, is that we spent since the merger, $30 billion plus in terms of new aircraft. We have the youngest fleet. We don't anticipate any big retirements coming up. And we have the ability to flex this fleet in a very economic fashion should we find that conditions warrant expansion. So you'll see us with moderate growth based on expectations for this year as we get out into the latter stages 2025 and 2026. If it's -- if demand and profitability warrant an adjustment, we'll be ready to go.\nSteve Johnson: And I'd just add that to the extent that you're asking that question based on an ASM growth comparison, I just also look at the growth in departures and recognize that as we grow, we're going to have our growth in the most competitive time channels and most competitive places possible. So it's -- I don't know that ASMs is the perfect measure for comparing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your question, please Michael.\nMichael Linenberg: All right, yes. Hey, good morning. Two sort of fleet-related questions here. Just on the comment on growing your international fleet from 120 to 200 by 2029. At that point in time, how many A321neo XLRs will you have in your fleet at that point? And presumably, that's in that 200 number?\nSteve Johnson: Yes, that is in the 200 number. And we expect to have 40neos at that point.\nMichael Linenberg: Great.\nSteve Johnson: 40 -- sorry, 40 XLRs at that point.\nMichael Linenberg: Great. And then just my second question, as we think about fleets getting old, and I know your fleet is aging and we start -- and I'm more specifically wide bodies and the ability to procure wide bodies. I know economically it makes sense to procure narrow bodies from both OEMs. You guys do that. It's helped you out well with the MAXs and the 321 or 320neos. Is -- are we at a point where the decision to do that with wide-body aircraft, whether it's to procure from different OEMs or even from two different families within the same OEM, when you think about your replacement for your wide bodies, probably later this decade? Thanks for taking my question.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Mike. And I'll start. Others can chime in. I really like where we're at in terms of our fleet. We're operating the world's largest fleet of 320 family aircraft. One of the world's largest operators of 737 aircraft. We've got the MAX 8s and fortunately, those are being delivered and we've got this order out for the MAX 10s. Now, the benefit in having these large fleets and in kind of one flavor, it's really helpful from an efficiency perspective, right? We're not out there with a dozen different aircraft types. Our pilots, our flight attendants, our catering, our servicing, our maintenance, engine, supply chain, you think about it, it greatly simplifies what we're doing. We had that same philosophy from a wide-body perspective. And we love the 787 model. The 8s and then the 9s are going to be the real workhorses as we go forward. We know that our customers love it as well. As we take a look at the 777s, the 777-300s are going to be around for some time and they're going to be getting a refresh. And starting this year, we'll see the benefit of the flagship suites coming out. Those are going to be in the fleet for a long time. We've got a decision to make about a 777-200s at some point in time, whether we reconfigure or do something else. And we're in contact with Airbus, we're in contact with Boeing as well. And we're also mindful of the benefits that we get by having a simplified fleet and with fleet types that give you great flexibility depending on range and demand. And the comment about your fleet's getting older, that's true. It's just the nature of time. But the fact of the matter is we're starting from a much better spot than any of our competitors. As Devon has said, our anticipated capital spending over the long run, and this is to provide virtually any growth -- level of growth that we want, especially if we have the ability to keep older aircraft around and hold off the retirement, it is very modest. So $3.5 billion type range, as we take a look out in -- to 2026 and beyond. 2025 is a real low spot in terms of capital spending. So we already have the lowest average age for our fleet. We don't have retirements coming up. And I see that as others have to invest in their fleet and they're talking about numbers that are more than double of those kind of capital expenditures and the difficulty, and -- at least with delivery of aircraft these days, I really like where we're at.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your question please, Brandon.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the question. Robert, I guess if you step back, I mean, because obviously so much has changed in the past year, especially since the Investor Day, I think, in March of last year. But obviously, you've talked about a lot getting corporate share back. But how would you articulate American's commercial strategy going forward today? And I guess I'm just observing here, but it feels like maybe you're still in a zone of defense. When does that then transition into an offensive front with that strategy?\nRobert Isom: Thanks for that question. And our Investor Day commitments, we stand by them. I don't like that we're not -- we haven't grown margins. And as I take a look out into the future, and as Devon has said, I do believe that we're set up well to grow margins, especially because of everything that we've done from an efficiency perspective. Now, I'm going to get back to the other side of that equation because it's not just a cost perspective, but you combine the record free cash flow production that we produce, we've done a really nice job of getting this airline set up so that we're not worried about balance sheet issues. And that puts us in a very different position. I've talked to you about our fleet, and as we take a look going forward, you are going to see this year American absolutely spend a lot more time in focus and energy in terms of improving our customer experience in a way that we can monetize. So from that perspective, we have a foundation built that I think others are trying to catch up on, whether it's establishment of satellite Wi-Fi across all fleets, ultra-premium lounges, which we're going to be introducing, a new Philadelphia lounge to add to the complement that we already have. This collection of premium seating on our aircraft. And whether it's the new flagship suites on 787-8s or 787-9s and the XLRs, or whether it's just the domestic product where we're so strong, we have a regional product that others can't touch in terms of the E175s. And in terms of the rest of the fleet, you'll see that the older aircraft that we have, whether it's the 320s and 319s, they're going to be both getting upgraded. And so I feel like we have all the pieces of the puzzle in place to really take off. Now, we've got some work to do putting that together and selling and telling our story better. But we are the largest in the best market in the world here in the U.S. We've got an enviable position in the biggest business market. When you think about London, Heathrow and Tokyo, we've got the best set of partners around the world in those biggest markets. American's got a lot of momentum as we look forward.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate that, Robert. And then, Devon, I know you talked a lot about the cost headwinds this year, but is there any productivity offsets potentially in these new labor agreements and especially in the context of that simplified fleet that Robert was just discussing?\nRobert Isom: Not necessarily offsets related to the labor agreements themselves. I think the offsets we're finding is just a lot of work on efficiency and investing in the right technologies. As we've talked about last year, our reengineering the business efforts generated about $500 million in value. This year, we think we're going to generate a couple hundred million dollars, but that's net of some really meaningful investments that we're making in our IT shop that we're making in our TechOps organization to digitalize all the work that they are doing. So I feel great about the investments we're making. It doesn't all necessarily pay back in this calendar year, but we look out to 2026. I think our cost profile is going to look really good. I've always said, I look back over the last several years, I think we've performed better than anybody when it comes to unit cost delivery. So we're not necessarily seeing anything in labor agreements. That's not what we were going after in those labor agreements. But we are running a more efficient business right now, and I think we're going to run a more efficient business a year from now than we are today.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be taking questions from media. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal. Your question please, Alison.\nAlison Sider: Hey, thanks so much. Curious after the starship breakup last week, how concerned are you about sort of the operational and safety impacts from space launches? And is there anything you're asking the FAA to do differently in terms of kind of how it handles those?\nRobert Isom: Well, Allie, thanks for the question. We're in constant contact with DOT and FAA. And no doubt launches do have an impact on our network, especially given the airspace issues that are impacted. So what we do, we coordinate closely. I've got David Seymour here, our Chief Operating Officer. And what he'll -- I think what he'll tell you is that we -- the coordination efforts is better than it's ever been and that one of the things we try to do is work with any launches to make sure that they're as least impactful in terms of time of day that they take place. Dave, you want to add anything?\nDavid Seymour: Yes, I think, Robert, you said the right things in our coordination with them. And I think it's just -- the FAA is going to be very mindful of those launches and they executed their strategy in locking out a containment zone for that launch. And it was disruptive to us in terms of diversions that we had to do, holding aircraft on the ground, but we recovered well. But as Robert said, the coordination right now that we have with the FAA and air traffic side has never been better. And we're going to continue to work with them on that.\nAlison Sider: Got it. I mean, do you know, or is there anything you want to be done differently for future launches in terms of the sort of perimeter for the closed airspace or the timing of launches or anything you're looking to change from a safety perspective?\nDavid Seymour: We're still waiting for the FAA to continue their review of that but on the surface right now, I don't see anything different that we're going to see. They've done a lot of work over the last several years of actually continuing to manage that. So we have not as impacted as we were in the past, but we're going to work with them. But I think they need to continue their review of that situation and then we'll get back and see if we need to adjust plans.\nAlison Sider: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg News. Your question please, Mary.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the IFE on the premium cabins that you're talking about going forward. I'm wondering what was the -- what's been responsible for that shift in your approach on IFE. It's just competitive pressure, something that consumers are demanding or what's behind that?\nRobert Isom: Oh, hey, Mary, just -- you might have mistaken something. In terms of our IFE strategy, in-flight seatback entertainment on our international based wide-body aircraft or in the case of the 321XLRs, those will be equipped to take care of our customers. The rest of our fleet will have satellite-based Wi-Fi, except for the smallest of the regional jets.\nMary Schlangenstein: Right. But you don't currently have IFE on your international wide-bodies, or am I wrong on that?\nRobert Isom: We currently have IFE on our international-based aircraft.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. Sorry about that. And the other question I wanted to ask was what changes that you potentially foresee from the Trump administration in terms of either the operations of the FAA and ATC issues with them trying to step up hiring or make changes faster than the past administration had to change the ATC issues affecting the airlines?\nRobert Isom: Well, as I said in some earlier comments, I think President Trump and the administration, they recognize the importance of aviation to commerce. They certainly did that during the first Trump administration in response to COVID and the support that was provided to the industry. It's a reason why the industry is as strong as it is today. And credit really does go to the first Trump administration and the quick reaction. Now in regard to what we do next, I do believe that it's imperative that we look at investing in air traffic control. We know that there's a huge tax put on efficiency for the airlines on our customers in terms of the time it takes to fly. And ultimately we've got to address it because there's a lot of growth that I think is possible and hoped for in the industry. But we can't keep on jamming more aircraft into the skies in a way that can't be serviced efficiently. So today, it takes a lot longer to fly from Chicago to New York or Washington to New York than it did 20 years ago. There's no reason for that. There's plenty of room in the sky. There's technology that we can be deploying that would be helpful from an overall control perspective. And also our aircraft are actually equipped to handle and to perform in a different system. So we've got a lot of work to do. It's going to take investment, but I have great confidence that that will be the type of work that we're able to engage on. And the last thing I'll just say is I also believe that the administration will be very cognizant of regulatory issues that can benefit both the airlines and our customers as well. And we'll be working closely with them on that. So I'm very, very optimistic about the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Please go ahead, Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just considering what the Trump administration has said about DEI and how they're extending that ordering changes within the federal government. I was curious where American Airlines stands. I see the website says DEI are foundational to American Airlines' culture and that you plan to lead the industry with DEI. Any changes there internally and do you have any concerns about the review at the FAA that the federal government is doing? Thanks.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Leslie. I can't speak to anything going on at the FAA. I'll just say that at American, we've always had a philosophy of hiring the best team members that we can possibly bring into the company. We serve 650,000 plus on peak days customers -- 650,000 plus customers of all backgrounds and places throughout the world. We have 130,000 team members that work in all parts of the globe. Our efforts here are going to be focused on caring for people on life's journey. And in that, we're going to do that in a way that's it's -- that's beneficial for our customers and profitable for our airline. That's going to be our guiding factor as we go forward in looking for ways to better take care of our customers and better take care of our team members. That's front and center. And that is where American is headed.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Latif. I appreciate everybody's interest and time today. And I'd just like to reiterate that the fourth quarter was a quarter for us in which we laid down some incredibly important milestones. It was important for us to outperform the industry in terms of revenue production year-over-year. It was important for us to achieve record free cash flow that put us in place to take advantage of a lot of other things that we've been doing in this company to make sure that our balance sheet is as strong as possible. And we're excited about the challenges that we've taken on, not only to restore our revenue performance, but also to expand upon that and take advantage of everything that we've built in this airline over the last several years. And so I'll reiterate our commitment to our customers to take care of them in the best possible fashion, and then I'll also reiterate our commitment to our investors. We are intent on growing margins, producing sustainable free cash flow, further continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. And there's a tremendous amount of upside in American right now. When you take a look at our performance and what we're capable of doing as we look out into 2025 and going into 2026, American is poised to outperform. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Scott Long, VP of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.\nScott Long: Thank you, Lateef. Good morning and welcome to the American Airlines Group third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the call with prepared remarks, we have our CEO, Robert Isom, and our CFO, Devon May. In addition to our Vice Chair, Steve Johnson, we have a number of other senior executives in the room this morning for the Q&A session. Robert will start the call with an overview of our performance, and Devon will follow with details on the third quarter in addition to outlining our operating plans and outlook going forward. After our prepared remarks, we’ll open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And before we begin today, we must state that today’s call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecasts of capacity, and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release, which was issued this morning, as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we’ll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found in the investor relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information we are giving you on the call this morning is as of today’s date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning, and with that, I’ll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge the devastation caused by the recent hurricanes in the Eastern United States. Hurricanes Helene and Milton have had a significant impact on so many, and I'm proud of the way the American Airlines team has stepped up to help. We had a 1,000 seats into and out of the impacted areas and cap fares for customers traveling to get out of the path of the hurricanes. Additionally, our cargo team has moved more than 8 tons of critical supplies to impacted regions, and our team and advantage members have donated more than $5 million to the American Red Cross to help out those impacted by Helene, Milton, and other significant weather events this year. Our thoughts are with the communities that's affected by these disasters, and we'll continue to support recovery efforts. Now to the results. Today, American reported a third quarter adjusted pretax profit of $271 million. This earnings result is higher than our guidance issued in July, with third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.30. I'm especially proud of this result given the operational challenges the team faced in the quarter, most notably, the impact of hurricanes Debbie and Helene and the CrowdStrike outage. The estimated net impact of these disruptions reduced our third quarter earnings by approximately $90 million or $0.12 per diluted share. Our remarks this morning will focus on our revenue performance, operational reliability, and cost execution in the third quarter. Notably, we hit or exceeded our prior guidance on every financial metric in the quarter, while also running a reliable operation. We're intently focused on delivering on our commitments. In this quarter, we did just that. On to our third quarter revenue performance. TRASM was down 2% in the quarter, 1.5 points better than the midpoint of our prior guidance. This improvement in the quarter was primarily driven by the steps we've taken to adjust domestic and short haul international capacity, which helped improve the balance of supply and demand. Domestic PRASM was down 3.1% year-over-year with performance improving through the quarter as industry capacity growth decelerated from July. Importantly, flown yields in September were positive year-over-year and we were able to narrow the competitive load factor gap we saw in the third quarter of last year. Long-haul international continued to perform well in the third quarter, with positive year-over-year unit revenue growth driven by strength in the Atlantic and South America. While short-haul Latin RASM was negative for the quarter, the region drove the largest sequential improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter, driven by the improving industry supply backdrop. Demand for Americans product remains strong as evidenced by the continued strength of our business, premium, and loyalty revenue performance. Managed business revenue was up 6% year-over-year and we continue to see yield strength in the segment. Premium revenue increased by approximately 8% year-over-year on 3% more capacity. Paid load factor in our premium cabins remains historically high and was up more than 4 points year-over-year with strength in both domestic and international. Loyalty revenues were up approximately 5% year-over-year, with AAdvantage members responsible for 72% of premium cabin revenue. Spending on our co-branded credit cards was up approximately 7% year-over-year in the third quarter, highlighting the value of American's loyalty program today and moving forward. In July, we committed to report on progress in regaining our share of revenue lost as a result of our prior sales and distribution strategy. We know success ultimately will be measured by improved revenue and earnings. In the near term, we're tracking our progress by measuring our agency and corporate booking performance, tracking the growth of our new AAdvantage Business Program, and listening to the feedback from our agency partners and corporate customers. Our third quarter indirect flown revenue share improved modestly compared with our performance in the second quarter. However, the booking trajectory through the quarter is encouraging. American's corporate and agency flown revenue share bottomed at 11% below our historical share. Since then, our share of indirect bookings has started to recover, and we estimate we are currently at 7% below historical levels, and we expect to see continued improvement in the months ahead. In the third quarter, we continued negotiations for new incentive based agreements with the largest TMCs and agencies. We now have new competitive agreements in place with more than half of those and are in advanced negotiations with the rest. We rebuilt our agency support capability and based on the team's NPS scores, they're providing world class service. These agreements combined with the support enhancements are major steps towards restoring our share in these important distribution channels. In September, we announced the relaunch of our corporate experience program to address feedback from our corporate customers. The program provides meaningful benefits including priority boarding, access to preferred seats, and priority re-accommodations during disruptions. Additionally, we have amended agreements with many of our top corporate customers. Adoption of AAdvantage Business, our program tailored for small and medium sized businesses, continued to build during the quarter. Our actions to expand the benefits, which include bookings through agencies, enhanced program support, and a more simplified enrolment process are clearly working. We expect to accelerate the growth of the program going forward. Concurrently, we've been engaged with our corporate and agency partners to ensure we're addressing the issues that matter most to our customers. We've heard universally that their worlds are better with three airlines rather than two, because of the network and travel rewards program that America delivers. Based on this feedback, we're confident we're taking the right actions. We know full restoration of our revenue will take some time, but with the progress we're seeing and the actions underway, we aim to fully restore our revenue from indirect channels as we exit 2025. We will continue our relentless focus on reestablishing relationships with our business customers, reembracing the agency channel, and making it easier to do business with American. Now turning to our operations. The American Airlines team delivered strong operational results in the third quarter, including outperforming our network peers over the peak summer travel period. These results were accomplished despite extended periods of difficult weather in several key hubs and continued supply chain challenges. Despite these obstacles, American led the U.S. network carriers in completion factor in the third quarter. This is a testament to our team's ability to plan and deliver a safe, reliable and consistent product for our customers. Earlier, I mentioned the financial impact of the CrowdStrike outage and hurricanes Debbie and Helene. The cost of those disruptions could have been far greater, if not for our team's quick recovery, which was a result of our focus and investment in the resiliency of our operation. As we closed the quarter in September and have transitioned into the fall, we're seeing some of the best operational performance of the year. And as promised at our Investor Day, American is delivering strong operational results. And moving forward, we expect to produce the same operational reliability even more efficiently. Now I'll turn it over to Devon to share more about our third quarter financial results and the fourth quarter outlook.\nDevon May: Thank you, Robert. Excluding net special items, we reported a third quarter net income of $205 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.30. We produced record third quarter revenue of $13.6 billion, up 1.2% year-over-year. Our unit revenue was down 2% year-over-year on 3.2% more capacity. Our adjusted EBITDAR margin was 11.1%, and we produced an adjusted operating margin of 4.7%. Our unit cost, excluding net special items and fuel, was up 2.8% year-over-year. This is at the higher end of our guidance range, due in part to expenses associated with the CrowdStrike disruption and two major hurricanes. Moving to our fleet. For 2024, we now expect to take delivery of 17 new aircraft, seven of which are planned to be delivered between now and the end of the year. Our 2024 aircraft CapEx, which also includes used aircraft purchases, spare engines and net PDPs is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion and our total CapEx is expected to be approximately $2.6 billion, a reduction of $300 million from our July guidance. Looking ahead to 2025, based on our current expectation for new deliveries, we anticipate our aircraft CapEx will be less than $3 billion, below the low end of our prior guidance range. We continue to expect moderate levels of CapEx through the end of the decade, with aircraft CapEx planned to average between $3 billion and $3.5 billion per year from 2026 to 2030. We ended the third quarter with $11.8 billion of total available liquidity. We produced approximately $170 million of free cash flow in the third quarter and have now produced $2.4 billion of free cash flow through the first three quarters of the year. We are on track to reduce our total debt by at least $13 billion from peak levels by the end of this year, and we remain committed to our goal of $15 billion of total debt reduction from peak levels by year-end 2025. Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. As we noted in July, we moved quickly to adjust our capacity growth in the back half of the year to better align with demand. With our schedule for the balance of the year now finalized, we expect to grow capacity by approximately 1% to 3% in the fourth quarter, and we expect our full year capacity will be up approximately 5% to 6%, in line with our prior guidance. We expect fourth quarter TRASM to be down 1% to 3%, and full year TRASM to be down 3% to 4% versus 2023. We continue to focus on driving efficiency and productivity through our reengineering the business initiatives. We are on track to deliver $400 million in cost savings this year with $300 million achieved through the third quarter. Additionally, we continue to expect to achieve more than $300 million in working capital improvements this year. Fourth quarter CASMx is expected to be up approximately 4% to 6% year-over-year. The higher sequential year-over-year unit cost growth is primarily driven by lower capacity growth and the impact of our new agreement with the APFA. We expect our full year CASMx to be up approximately 2% to 3%, consistent with the guidance we provided in January, as we continue to effectively manage expenses. Our current forecast for the fourth quarter assumes a fuel price of between $2.20 and $2.40 per gallon. Based on our current demand assumptions and fuel price forecast, we expect to produce an adjusted operating margin of between 4.5% and 6.5% for the fourth quarter or earnings of approximately $0.25 to $0.50 per diluted share. With this fourth quarter guidance, we expect to deliver a full year adjusted operating margin of between 4.5% and 5.5% and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.35 to $1.60. We now expect to generate between $1 billion and $1.5 billion of free cash flow in 2024. This includes the impact of a one-time bonus for our flight attendants of approximately $500 million. As we prepare for 2025, we are focused on producing capacity that is in line with our expectation of demand growth. While capacity planning for the year ahead is ongoing, we currently expect our 2025 capacity to grow low-single digits year-over-year. This growth will be focused on bringing back capacity in markets that are still not restored to historical levels. As we demonstrated with the capacity adjustments we put in place in the back half of this year, we will remain flexible and will adjust capacity in response to the demand environment and the competitive environment we are operating in. I'll now turn the call back to Robert for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Devon. We remain focused on operating a reliable airline, executing on our initiatives and delivering results. We continue to produce historically strong operational reliability. We remain on track to achieve our balance sheet goals. We're reengineering the business to ensure we continue to manage costs with the best in the industry, while delivering a better experience for our customers and team. With the changes we're making in our commercial organization, we're setting the foundation for success as we regain our share of corporate and agency revenue. We will continue to make progress on those efforts, listening to customer feedback and tracking our performance to ensure the changes we're making are producing the expected returns. Winning back the full share of revenue that we've lost will take some time, but we're committed to reaching that objective as we exit 2025 and get back on track with the long-term targets we outlined at our Investor Day, and that's growing our margins, generating sustainable free cash flow, and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet through debt reduction. To accomplish this, we need the entire American Airlines team working together and pulling in the same direction. With the ratification of the new contract with the APFA and our tentative agreement with the TWU-IAM Association, which covers our mechanics and fleet service team members. We've reached new agreements covering more team members in a shorter period of time than ever before. Not only do these agreements ensure we're taking care of our team, but they also provide a level of certainty in our planning that will help us efficiently achieve the goals we've set for American. We're focused on delivering on our commitments, and we believe achieving our long-term targets will unlock significant value. And with that, operator, please open the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Go ahead, Andrew.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Yes. First question for Robert. I guess, when I look at your total revenue growth, it's been sort of flattish in four of the last six quarters here. Obviously, trailing GDP, but also the other global carriers. Do you think you can get back to GDP type style to top line growth and what do you need to see to get there from here?\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Andrew. I appreciate that. And the answer to that is for sure. So I'll start with this, that we did some damage to ourselves with our sales and distribution strategy. You've heard us talk a lot about that. I'm really pleased with what I see in terms of recovery of that. We grew our corporate managed business in the third quarter by 6%, we can do better than that. And I know that that's something that we can achieve. As we take a look at the efforts that we've put in place to win back that share, whether that's restoring full content, negotiating new deals and enhancing existing deals with our agency partners and also our corporate partners, that's all under work, and it's taking root and it's showing in terms of our forward bookings. As I mentioned earlier today, we bottomed out at corporate and agency indirect share compared to historical averages of about 11% down. And as we exit September, we know that we've recovered back to about 7% down. So I see that progress continuing. On top of that, I'll speak to the strength of our network and our partnerships and competing just from a product perspective. And then finally, I know that we'll make some progress in being more competitive in terms of our co-brand relationship and what that can bring to our business as well. So I've got a lot of confidence and pleased with the progress that I see so far.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And on that co-brand perspective, I guess, there was a press article last month that spoke about you potentially consolidating your card program with just Citi. Where do negotiations stand with regards to new economics there? And I think at Investor Day, you were talking about maybe timeline by year-end 2024 in terms of potential timeline of getting a deal across the finish line. Does that still seem reasonable? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Good. Thanks for the question. I'm going to hand that over to Steve.\nSteve Johnson: Hey. Thanks, Andrew. We have two really exceptional friends and partners in Citi and Barclays. And I want to give a shout-out, we've worked together to create a really terrific program that I think has a sensational future. I think, in terms of talking about our progress, I'm actually going to give a salute to, the Dodgers, and more importantly, to Steve Trent, who actually framed this question in July in terms of a baseball game. And I'd say that I'd characterize our progress as the bottom of the seventh inning at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Scott.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So RASM was down 2% in the third quarter, I presumably improved throughout the quarter. The fourth quarter guide down 1% to 3%, I guess, doesn't really imply any incremental improvement. Any color on why? And then maybe any regional color?\nRobert Isom: So Scott, I'll start. First off, as we take a look at the fourth quarter, I do see strong demand overall, but it's a quarter in which a strong October, and I think a strong December has some noise in it, in terms of expected softness in demand around the election, around Halloween. But as we take a look at how bookings have progressed, I see that October very strong, December very strong. And as we look out into 2025, same holds true for what we have on the books for January as well. We've got some capacity growth in the quarter, but it's modest, it's been reduced considerably. And we're going to work hard to make sure we deliver on the forecast that we've produced.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just secondly, you made a comment about low-single digit capacity growth for '25. What do you think that -- any early thoughts on what that should mean for CASM? And then, you sound confident about the corporate recovery by the end of '25. What's the revenue opportunity from that?\nDevon May: Hey, Scott. It's Devon. Yeah. We're not going to give CASM guidance for 2025 right now. But as you'd expect, the largest headwind we faced in 2025 are the increases in salaries and benefits resulting from the CBAs that we have reached over the past 18 months. We expect the competitors are going to have very similar CASM pressure. But for us, it's nice to have the certainty in planning, also magnifies the importance of all of our efforts to run a lean operation and invest in the right technology to run a more efficient and effective business. But that's -- the main area will be on salaries and benefits. There'll be some other cost pressures, things like regional growing at a faster rate than mainline. But I feel we've been the best in the business at managing our expenses over the past several years, and it will be a focus of ours in 2025 as well.\nRobert Isom: And Scott, in terms of revenue, last quarter, I said that we think that in terms of higher yielding corporate and agency related revenue, we're missing out about $1.5 billion of revenue over a course of the year. Now we've replaced some of that with lower yielding traffic. But our intent is to win the vast majority of that back over the course of 2025. And based on the efforts that we're taking right now, I feel confident we'll be able to do that. The cycle in which contracts are established for agencies and corporates, it's done on an annual basis. And sometimes it even takes -- sometimes those contracts actually run over the course of a couple of years. But what we're seeing right now is a lot of reception. People want us back. I've talked to not only buyers and purchasing team members from our corporates and TMCs, but also the CEOs, the world is better for them with another competitor in the mix. And so there's a lot of positive reaction to us getting more competitive, offering the services and amenities that are competitive.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Robert, I want to touch back on the distribution chart where you show that sequential improvement. I get maybe every point is about $140 million on an annual basis. Where are we with the $1.5 billion hole? Is that still the hit this year despite the fact that we are starting to see improvement right now? And the fact that we are seeing this type of improvement, it doesn't seem like you're really incorporating much of it in the fourth quarter given the flat RASM -- or excuse me, the down 1% to 3% RASM guide, similar to what you did in the September quarter?\nRobert Isom: Thanks for the question. I'll just start with this. We've taken a very deliberate approach as we've sat down with our agency partners and corporate buyers. We've seen tremendous progress, as I said, evidenced by forward bookings, but not a lot of that has showed up in the third quarter. We expect to see more as we progress into the fourth quarter, and then acceleration as we move into 2025. Again, we've got to give a chance for the contracts to actually be in place, changes to be made. And then ultimately, I'm looking for restoration on an accelerated basis as we move into 2025.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. And then just a capacity question. I do see that your supply is down a bit in some of your international markets like Transatlantic. Presumably that's being driven by airplanes that are going through a reconfiguration. Can you just talk about that reconfiguration program and maybe how many wide bodies it will take out of your fleet as you expand your premium offering? Thanks for taking my questions.\nRobert Isom: No. Thanks for that. And in terms of aircraft reconfigurations, 777-300, the 20, 777-300s that we have, they are due to start their reconfigurations next year. And we'll be talking more about that as we get into our 2025 planning cycle. But there's not any of that as we take a look into fourth quarter. More of what you're seeing is us just aligning the capacity to where we can best utilize the aircraft and quite frankly, serve our customers and generate the most revenue. So one of the things you've seen is that capacity has been, I think, brought more into balance in London Heathrow and that bodes well for us. We're certainly seeing that in stronger London Heathrow yields. Transatlantic, as we move into the fourth quarter overall appears to be very solid. And so, it's more an aircraft deployment issue. As we get into 2025, we'll be able to say more about impact of reconfigurations on our wide body fleet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan Securities. Your question, please, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Hey. Good morning, everybody. So if we look at the third quarter, non-GAAP earnings were pretty similar to those of last year's third quarter, but on fuel that was $0.40 a gallon lower. If we look at the guide for the fourth quarter, at the midpoint of EPS, you're obviously up year-on-year, but on fuel, it's $0.70 lower. The point is, if we normalize for fuel, your core in the fourth quarter year-on-year looks like it's doing worse than in the third quarter. What do you think explains that?\nDevon May: Hey, Jamie. It's Devon.\nJamie Baker: Hi, Devon.\nDevon May: I think as we've always talked about, there's a relationship between fuel and revenue. So we have adjusted capacity, the industry has adjusted capacity to the current supply environment. Obviously, if fuel was $0.70 higher, we would be producing slightly less capacity than we are today. I think the industry would probably be adjusting at the same time. So none of this can be looked at in isolation. You're right that earnings in the fourth quarter relatively flat, just up slightly at the midpoint. We expect to do better than that. And as we head into 2025, we're looking forward to margin expansion.\nJamie Baker: And second -- and thanks, Devon. When we think about management priorities, Robert has said that he's spending a lot of time helping repair corporate relationships and progress is being made and operations are markedly improved. The balance sheet continues to improve. There's loyalty kicker coming. These are all good things. My question relates to the network. I'm curious, what you think your greatest network deficiencies are? And more importantly, does management have the appetite or is it a priority to address those deficiencies? Thanks in advance.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Jamie. And look, our highest priorities right now are making sure that we make best use of the assets that we have, and notably regaining our corporate and agency share, getting our co-brand credit card renegotiated, and then competing with -- on product and service. But in regard to the network, look, we said it at the Investor Day, and I'll underscore it again. We have a fantastic network. It can take customers anywhere they want to get in the world. We have the best set of partnerships in the biggest business and travel destinations around the world. We've been aggressive in the past in terms of making sure that we shore up any deficiencies. Most notably, we have a relationship with Alaska Airlines on the West Coast. We tried to strengthen our position on the East Coast with the NEA. And as we take a look at going forward, we're very focused on making sure our network appeals to customers from a leisure basis, international, and certainly from a business perspective. And as you take a look at what we're doing in New York and Los Angeles, I'll note that in New York, between LaGuardia and JFK, that we have -- we will be flying as we move into next year, the largest schedule that we've had since the pandemic. I'm really pleased with the product that we're putting in place, whether it's the lounges, the 321Ts and ultimately, the XLRs that will be flying Transcon, the great relationship that we have with BA to set up just the best shuttle to London Heathrow, and the work that we're doing out on the West Coast, again, with Alaska. Our combined position certainly puts us in great strength. And even on our own, in the L.A. basin airports, we have considerable strength. So it’s about knitting all these things together and utilizing to the greatest extent, for greatest benefit for our customers and making sure that we do our best to yield up wherever we can. We’ve got a lot of work ahead of us, but that’s all upside with the assets that we have today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James. Please go ahead, Savi.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good morning. I was wondering if you could, just to kind of follow up on Scott's question earlier, provide a little bit more color on the fourth quarter trend here. And you called out noise, election. I think, I was not sure if there was a Milton impact in there. I wonder if you could just help us understand the unit revenue guide that you provided and what the core trend might be both kind of in the domestic and the various international markets?\nRobert Isom: Yeah. Savi, what I'll say is, we -- take a look at the fourth quarter overall. And I'd say, again, there's strength in demand. We're not going to have any trouble filling up our planes. I do think that that's a result of the supply and demand balance being relatively more in shape. And I think that that's going to progress as well. I think that, from a supply perspective, we're going to see improvement. But the fourth quarter as a whole, strong October, some weakness in early parts of November as a result of Halloween and the election. Not unexpected. And in the fourth quarter, we see a lot of strength, I'm sorry, as we move to December, see a lot of strength around the holidays, see a lot of strength over Thanksgiving as well. So people want to travel, and we're very optimistic about how the bookings look for the fourth quarter.\nSavanthi Syth: I appreciate that. And then, just on the -- I know, it's very early days on the 2025 capacity growth, and I appreciate the color there. Just curious, in connection to the unit cost headwinds mentioned maybe a little bit more regional growth than mainline. I was curious, if you can talk about high level how you're thinking about kind of domestic growth versus maybe near international versus international?\nDevon May: Hey, Savi. Not a whole lot of color at this point on growth by entity for 2025. But obviously, the regional growth will be entirely focused on domestic. It just doesn't drive a ton of ASMs. But as we bring back capacity, there's probably 1% of consolidated capacity or more that's coming out of regional that will largely be on the domestic side. The rest of the growth, I think, will be split relatively evenly, maybe a little more international than domestic. But we have to let our plans develop a bit.\nRobert Isom: And Savi, just a little more color on that. Coming out of the pandemic, we really focused on restoring our SunBelt hubs to get them to full capacity. You'll see us position more capacity than the northern tier hubs. Regionals are going to give us a great flexibility in being able to make sure that we can take customers where they want to go when they want to go.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Your question, please, Conor.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Maybe following up to Jamie's question. On the product side, you're talking to your corporates now pretty in depth, and I imagine you're engaging with regular customers in general. But just have preferences changed at all in terms of onboard experience? You have United talking about free Wi-Fi, you have Southwest rolling out their premium experience. Just curious on how you view -- how American's product kind of stacks up to the industry at this point? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Yeah. Thanks, Conor. I'll start with this. There's clearly a preference for more premium type services. And one of the things you'll note in our results is premium revenues have risen by 8% quarter-over-quarter in 2023 -- over the third quarter in 2023. I think that bodes well for us because it's paid load factor and its yield. But it bodes well for us because you'll see over the course of the next two years through 2026 that our premium seating is going to grow by about 20%. And that's as a result of the reconfiguration of 777-300s, but as well as the introduction of the 787-9s with the flagship suites, XLRs, and then also domestically, reconfiguration of our 320s and our 319s. So there's absolutely a preference from that perspective. I think that that's going to continue. I think we're going to be on the right side of the ledger on that. In terms of product, you mentioned customers want control and convenience. We've invested an incredible amount in terms of technology, and we'll continue to do that to give customers the ability to control their itineraries and then also to be able to help them recover when there are any type of disruptions as part of that. People want to be connected whenever and wherever they fly. American was the first to get our narrow-body fleet fully equipped with satellite based Wi-Fi. We're going to be expanding that for our large regional jet portfolio as well. So it will be the first to have satellite-based Wi-Fi on the combined narrow-body and regional fleet. And I think that we're going to have to take a look at making sure that we serve customers' needs from that perspective as well, but you'll see us invest in our product. We'll have flagship suites in terms of new deliveries on the XLRs and the 787-9s, those will have seatback video. Those will also have international satellite Wi-Fi as well. And then from a services perspective, on the ground, same thing. We were the first to really up the game in terms of lounge experience with flagship dining. And I'm really proud of the facility that we have in New York with three lounge options that really set a standard. You'll see us next year invest and roll out new lounge experiences in Philadelphia and planning upgrades in other places throughout the system as well. So as we take a look out in the future, I think that customers are looking to having a more premium experience. We're going to accommodate that. They want more control. We're going to make sure that we'll engage them on that front. And overall, I think that the game plan for American is going to be very beneficial in unlocking a lot of value from a revenue perspective.\nConor Cunningham: Super detailed, appreciate that, Robert. And then, you're talking about renegotiation with corporates engaging with them again. Is that in line with your expectations, the exit rate? And then, the word that caught me by surprise, I think, was just you dropped the word competitive as you renegotiate the contract. Does that mean that the revenue recapture that you're seeing is coming in at a lower margin going forward? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: I'll start on this, and Steve can fill. First off, I'll just restate that the reaction I've received from the countless CEOs and professionals at agencies and corporate buying groups has been, thank goodness, you're back. We want to engage. We want to engage in a way that is sustainable and profitable over the long run. So I've been very, very pleased with the reception. Steve, do you want to give some more detail?\nSteve Johnson: Yeah. Sure. Maybe more generally about the third quarter, because there's been a couple of questions that I'd characterize as kind of why is it taking so long. But I mean we -- when I think about the last 90 days, we had a handful of objectives, I think that were immediate and needed to be focused on. I mean, first, we had to stabilize the ship and refocus the team. We'd had a very significant disruption, and I'm really pleased with the progress that we made on that. Second, we needed to rebuild our foundation and our infrastructure for being able to participate in the traditional sales and distribution channels. I mean that had largely been dismantled. And we needed to build that in a way that it would be lasting and that our partners would trust the fact that we were back in the game. And I think we made a really -- we made really significant progress on that. Third, and I think most importantly, we needed to reestablish and start redeveloping our relationships. I mean, that meant listening and listening to a lot of people. And ultimately, getting past a stage that was really anger and getting -- reacquainting ourselves with these people and regaining their trust in a way that was really important. That meant talking to people, it meant negotiating agreements on a kind of counterparty-by-counterparty basis. And it just meant engagement. And as Robert had said a couple of times, I mean, that's been really positive. We made a lot of progress on that. And we've heard over and over and over again that the agencies, the TMCs, our corporate customers, that their world is better with three airlines competing instead of just two. Fourth, we wanted to shift some share. We talked about that, and we said that we would measure ourselves by share, and we accomplished that, as Robert has mentioned a couple of times. Fifth, we wanted to outperform guidance. We hadn't done that in a long time. And we did that this time, and I think everybody is really proud of that effort. And then finally, we wanted to -- we wanted that outperformance to be meaningful and meaning that we wanted to do it in a way that we didn't lose additional ground to our principal competitors. And I think we accomplished that in the third quarter as well. I mean, I’m not going to say that we’re done or anything nearly that. There’s tons of work to be done. But I’d like to think that that’s a solid start, and I think it has the team and Robert and Devon and I really excited about what we can accomplish in the next 90 days and in 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Just a couple. On the fleet delays, I'm just wondering how impactful these are to your 2025 planning, if you have any sense for what your 2025 growth might have looked like absent any fleet delays or is this more about delaying aircraft retirements? And then relatedly, and a follow-up to Savi, how are you thinking about utilization expansion next year, which I think was a big theme entering this year?\nRobert Isom: Hey, Duane. Yeah. Capacity for 2025 is being impacted by these delays, like, we're fortunate to have a fleet that can run at pretty strong utilization. You saw that this year where, versus the start of the year, we probably took delivery of 15 or 20 less airplanes or something like that, than what we expected and we still met our capacity guidance for the year. Next year, we'd probably be a little bit higher in terms of capacity if it weren't for our expected delays. That being said, we can push utilization a little bit. We still think we could if we wanted to and if the competitive or demand environment dictated, that we could grow ahead of our low-single digit guide, but it is impacted to some extent. On the utilization side for next year, you'll mostly see it with regional aircraft where utilization will be up pretty materially as we have gotten back to full supportability throughout this year. Mainline utilization maybe up slightly, but it won't be as material as what we've seen on the regional side.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. Thanks for that. And then, in terms of corporate share recovery, I don't know if you're willing to speak to this, but where do you think the old strategy hurt you the most geographically? Was the share loss really even across your network, in places like DFW and Charlotte? And Steve, maybe your Dodgers shout-out gives us a clue. I don't want to read too much into it, but where do you think this pivot will help you most?\nSteve Johnson: Clearly, in the big cities that are the most competed, New York, L.A., Chicago. We definitely were hurt disproportionately in places where we're less strong. And so -- and that's what we're seeing -- as we see this start to come back, that's where it's starting to come back.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent of Citi. Your line is open, Steve.\nStephen Trent: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen and thanks taking my time – taking the time for my questions, and to the other, Steve, on the call, we're quite baseball focused here as well, so appreciate that. Just a bit of a follow-up when I think about maintenance. I know you guys have a relatively young fleet, but have you thought about maybe other strategies, engine module swaps or using drones or these kind of things when you think about your aircraft maintenance strategy? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: So I'll start. And just first with this, I think as we move out into 2025 and beyond, I think that the industry is going to continue to have a shortfall of resources. American is very well protected and resourced in an environment where the supply chain struggles, especially around maintenance related items. We have the largest group of mechanics, all represented by the TWU-IAM Association of any carrier. We have the world's largest commercial maintenance overhaul base in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And in all of that, I know right now from what I see that we're outperforming others in the industry, whether that be other airlines and also MROs. I know that because of the kind of the turn times that we produce on our CFM56 engines. So I think we're really well positioned in a world where there's constrained resources. On top of that, and I'll let David Seymour, our Chief Operations Officer to speak, I know as well that we're bringing to bear the best in terms of technology to not only maintenance but all aspects of the operation.\nDavid Seymour: Yeah, Robert. Thank you. The team is exploring all this, and that's new technology that's out there, but we're looking at whether it's drones or using high definition cameras to be able to pinpoint damage, assess damage, and those types of things that we would do ordinarily in a heavy check environment. So that field is starting to grow. We're definitely exploring options in that to get more efficient with what we do.\nRobert Isom: And David, I'll just add this. Technology is going to be a key item for us as we look forward. When we talk about aircraft utilization, we start identifying any type of improvement [Technical Difficulty] right now in a way that I think we can recover better than any other airline. We're using that technology and the tools that David mentioned in terms of our training. And one of the things that you'll see is that through deployment of basically, iPads throughout the system, whether that be for our pilots and flight attendants and ultimately, for our mechanics out on the line, their job has become so much easier. So this is something that we're going to excel in. We're already really strong, and it's going to be a differentiator for the company.\nStephen Trent: Very helpful. Thank you very much. And just a quick follow-up as well, all the changes you're making with corporate and what have you. Have you contemplated making any adjustments or any other adjustments in your frequent flyer program? For example, some of your competitors have mileage programs where their points don't expire? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: So from a loyalty perspective, look, we’re really proud of the AAdvantage program overall. We’re constantly looking at ways to better engage our customers, not only from a loyalty perspective, but just also from a value perspective. And while there may be some carriers that are doing something different, I do know one thing that you take a look at any type of assessment of the value of a mile on American Airlines versus anyone else, you’ll see that we absolutely generate more value for our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Fitzgerald of TD Cowen. Your line is open, Tom.\nThomas Fitzgerald: Thanks so much for the time, everyone. Thinking about the Wi-Fi, and if that free Wi-Fi starts to become table stakes across the industry, are you concerned at all about the revenue headwind that could present?\nRobert Isom: Tom, thanks for the question. No, I'm not concerned because, first off, you need to have high-speed Wi-Fi to be able to offer it at any level to give customers confidence that they'll be able to access and use it. We're going to be expanding coverage for our Wi-Fi. As I mentioned, our regional fleet will have it along with our narrow-body fleet. And we're going to be really competitive. We're going to make sure that our customers are taken care of and what they want, especially our most loyal customers. We're going to make sure that they're protected and taken care of. We already offer a number of opportunities for our customers to engage with us on a fee basis, and also on a free basis with some partners. We'll keep an eye on that and make sure that we don't fall short even for a second. Thanks.\nThomas Fitzgerald: That's really helpful. Thanks. And then just quickly on the -- with the CapEx, some of that shifting to the right, would you look to accelerate any debt pay down? Thanks again for the time.\nDevon May: It's a good question and a fair question. Right now, we feel pretty good about the outlook. With what we're doing on total debt reduction, we've stayed consistent with our goal of $15 billion of total debt reduction. Right now, we have two maturities in 2025 that we'll have some options around whether we do a refinancing on those maturities or if we pay down, and that will be dependent on where we are at with free cash flow and our liquidity outlook. But for now, we're feeling really good about the $15 billion total debt reduction goal. And yeah, we may look to advance that or further reduce debt depending on what happens throughout 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel McKenzie of Seaport Global. Please go ahead, Daniel.\nDaniel McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Going back to technology being a key item and your comment on IT investments. I understand not going to drive improved maintenance, but on revenue, is there a revenue opportunity from getting the right offer in front of the customer at the right time? And for those with a longer time frame, what does the upside look from -- look like from that potential upsell?\nRobert Isom: So I'll start. Steve, you can add on to this as well. I'll just start with this, Dan. First off, we've invested billions, $12 billion, in terms of technology over the last decade. And that kind of investment is going to continue as part of where we focus our efforts, and whether it's in operations, which David covered to a certain extent, or our operations control, which is definitely something that is an area of focus, attention is on our customers, making sure that we're as easy to do business as possible, that they can afford themselves of everything that they want in terms of services and amenities, and that they have the control for that. So you'll continue to see us invest in things that make us easy to do business with. And as part of that, and tying back to our product strategy, we know customers want access to more premium products. Making that available to them in an easy fashion is going to be a focus. I'm not going to put a number on it right now, but it's a big effort. Steve?\nSteve Johnson: Thanks, Robert. Dan, I'd just add, I, as you might guess, spend most of my time focusing on some of the issues that we've been discussing over the last two earnings calls, but all of my free time is focused on excitement about what new technologies and artificial intelligence can do to help us both deliver better products to customers, more tailored products to customers, engage better with our customers, and ultimately improve revenues. It's really an exciting part of the business, and we are very focused on it. Thanks for the question.\nDaniel McKenzie: Yeah. And I guess, if I could just follow up with one more on AI driving improved efficiency, because that's exactly what I was getting at. Bigger picture, what do you want the efficiency metrics to look like, say, one or two years from now? And what kind of cost savings could that potentially imply?\nRobert Isom: So Dan, I'll start, Devon can add into this. Look, we're intent on margin expansion. And one of the efforts that I asked Devon to take on now well over a year ago, almost we're 1.5 years into it was reengineering the company from an efficiency perspective. The first effort down that path was really to make sure that we're getting the most out of the assets that we have today, the relationships that we have today, so everything from purchasing to freeing up working capital, to just doing things in a better fashion -- a little bit better fashion than we do today. Those efforts have paid off. I think that in Devon's comments you mentioned that we're on track for producing $400 million in terms of savings in 2024, which will grow as we move into 2025, freeing up working capital as well. We're not going to stop at this first effort in terms of reengineering. The next effort will then be to put an AI lens to everything that we do. And on that front, I'm really pleased with the collaboration between Devon May, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ganesh Jayaram, our Head of Information Technology and Digital. They're both on it, and we look forward to talking more about our efforts as we get into 2025.\nDevon May: I really don't have much to add. We're really proud of the progress we have made so far to drive efficiencies in the business. I think it's a huge opportunity ahead. You're going to see it in metrics like we talked about at Investor Day, things like this year, we're growing the airline 5.5%, but we're growing our head count by 1%. I think you’ll see the same types of outcomes as we invest more into Gen AI and other technologies that are going to allow us to better utilize our assets, better utilize our people and better serve our customers.\nOperator: Thank you, analysts, for your questions. At this time, the line is open to media. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg. Your line is open, Mary.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. Good morning. Hey. As you guys work on your corporate rebuilding strategy and trying to win back business, can you say at this point, what was the main point of where you went wrong? At what point did you realize that your strategy was the wrong strategy and how did you get to that point? If you can just kind of maybe break that down just a little bit.\nRobert Isom: So Mary, I'll repeat what I said in the second quarter. Look, our revenue performance fell off as we moved into the second quarter of this year, it became noticeable. And it would be something -- and something that we knew we had to address. In terms of the efforts that we were trying to bring about, which is technology change and really trying to spur the marketplace, we have to be conscious of the competitive environment. We have to be conscious of technology. And most importantly, we have to be conscious of what our customers want at the end of the day. We absolutely can do a better job listening. Steve is engaged on that front. I'm pleased with the progress we're making in getting back and reestablishing our commitment to customers. And I know that the revenue rebound is going to follow from that effort.\nMary Schlangenstein: So do you feel in retrospect like there wasn't perhaps enough oversight to make sure, before you lost business, that you weren't taking the wrong steps?\nRobert Isom: Mary, this is an opportunity for us, and it's upside at American. As we regain our share, that's something that I think that is unique to American. And we're intent on doing that and serving our customers how they want to be served. And in that case, we have a lot of customers that really want to invest in technology and move forward. We have other customers that really want to take a different approach. We’re going to make sure that we’re serving them all. We are in the business of taking care of customers, all customers, and making sure that they have a place at American and feel like they’re well taken care of.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Your question, please, Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering, if you have an update on the cabin refurbishment for the 777 and 321. Those seem to be a bit behind schedule. When do you expect those to be complete or make some progress there? And then secondly, do you have any idea if there's kind of a lull in bookings around the election and is it any different in its scale than previous elections? Thanks.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Leslie. I'll start with the last, which is, look, we expect there to be some distraction around Halloween and the election. We adjusted our capacity to account for that. So it's not surprising. And as I said, October and December certainly looked very strong, and the Thanksgiving holiday as well. So we’re pleased with what we see overall. Just have to be cognizant that during election time and Halloween, there’s usually a little bit of a tapering off of demand. In terms of any reconfigurations we’re doing, we have 777-300s, we have 319s and 320s that will all be going into modification work. Those all vary in terms of timing. The 777-300s are more likely towards the end of -- as we get out of the summer of 2025. Other programs will be started and progress over time. The biggest thing I can say on all those fronts though is that we are dependent on the supply chain. Right now, that supply chain, especially in regard to seats is very tight. And so message to our suppliers, our partners is to work with us to make sure that we get those -- that equipment on dock as expected, and we’re really pushing to make sure that that’s the case right now.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?\nRobert Isom: Well, thanks for that. And thanks, everybody, for making time for us. I will close with this. I’m pleased with the progress that we’re making. It’s great to get back on track, delivering on what we say we’re going to do. That’s been something that I’ve wanted to make sure is a hallmark of American, and we’re going to get back on track to doing that. And to that end, this is about making sure we deliver on some of the things that we talked about at Investor Day. And that is making sure that we have margin expansion, free cash flow production, strengthening of the balance sheet. The kind of things that we talked about today in terms of regaining share, competing vigorously, establishing a new co-brand credit card relationship. All of those are upside for American. So as we work through 2025, I know that these are all going to take root and I’m very optimistic about our future. I want to give a shout out to our team. It’s never been harder to run an airline. And with industry-leading reliability and circumstances that we have, I think it’s just an incredible accomplishment. Thank you very much for your time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Scott Long, VP of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.\nScott Long: Thank you, Lateef. Good morning and welcome to the American Airlines Group third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. On the call with prepared remarks, we have our CEO, Robert Isom, and our CFO, Devon May. In addition to our Vice Chair, Steve Johnson, we have a number of other senior executives in the room this morning for the Q&A session. Robert will start the call with an overview of our performance, and Devon will follow with details on the third quarter in addition to outlining our operating plans and outlook going forward. After our prepared remarks, we’ll open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. To get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And before we begin today, we must state that today’s call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecasts of capacity, and fleet plans. These statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release, which was issued this morning, as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we’ll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found in the investor relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information we are giving you on the call this morning is as of today’s date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. Thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning, and with that, I’ll turn the call over to our CEO, Robert Isom.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge the devastation caused by the recent hurricanes in the Eastern United States. Hurricanes Helene and Milton have had a significant impact on so many, and I'm proud of the way the American Airlines team has stepped up to help. We had a 1,000 seats into and out of the impacted areas and cap fares for customers traveling to get out of the path of the hurricanes. Additionally, our cargo team has moved more than 8 tons of critical supplies to impacted regions, and our team and advantage members have donated more than $5 million to the American Red Cross to help out those impacted by Helene, Milton, and other significant weather events this year. Our thoughts are with the communities that's affected by these disasters, and we'll continue to support recovery efforts. Now to the results. Today, American reported a third quarter adjusted pretax profit of $271 million. This earnings result is higher than our guidance issued in July, with third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.30. I'm especially proud of this result given the operational challenges the team faced in the quarter, most notably, the impact of hurricanes Debbie and Helene and the CrowdStrike outage. The estimated net impact of these disruptions reduced our third quarter earnings by approximately $90 million or $0.12 per diluted share. Our remarks this morning will focus on our revenue performance, operational reliability, and cost execution in the third quarter. Notably, we hit or exceeded our prior guidance on every financial metric in the quarter, while also running a reliable operation. We're intently focused on delivering on our commitments. In this quarter, we did just that. On to our third quarter revenue performance. TRASM was down 2% in the quarter, 1.5 points better than the midpoint of our prior guidance. This improvement in the quarter was primarily driven by the steps we've taken to adjust domestic and short haul international capacity, which helped improve the balance of supply and demand. Domestic PRASM was down 3.1% year-over-year with performance improving through the quarter as industry capacity growth decelerated from July. Importantly, flown yields in September were positive year-over-year and we were able to narrow the competitive load factor gap we saw in the third quarter of last year. Long-haul international continued to perform well in the third quarter, with positive year-over-year unit revenue growth driven by strength in the Atlantic and South America. While short-haul Latin RASM was negative for the quarter, the region drove the largest sequential improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter, driven by the improving industry supply backdrop. Demand for Americans product remains strong as evidenced by the continued strength of our business, premium, and loyalty revenue performance. Managed business revenue was up 6% year-over-year and we continue to see yield strength in the segment. Premium revenue increased by approximately 8% year-over-year on 3% more capacity. Paid load factor in our premium cabins remains historically high and was up more than 4 points year-over-year with strength in both domestic and international. Loyalty revenues were up approximately 5% year-over-year, with AAdvantage members responsible for 72% of premium cabin revenue. Spending on our co-branded credit cards was up approximately 7% year-over-year in the third quarter, highlighting the value of American's loyalty program today and moving forward. In July, we committed to report on progress in regaining our share of revenue lost as a result of our prior sales and distribution strategy. We know success ultimately will be measured by improved revenue and earnings. In the near term, we're tracking our progress by measuring our agency and corporate booking performance, tracking the growth of our new AAdvantage Business Program, and listening to the feedback from our agency partners and corporate customers. Our third quarter indirect flown revenue share improved modestly compared with our performance in the second quarter. However, the booking trajectory through the quarter is encouraging. American's corporate and agency flown revenue share bottomed at 11% below our historical share. Since then, our share of indirect bookings has started to recover, and we estimate we are currently at 7% below historical levels, and we expect to see continued improvement in the months ahead. In the third quarter, we continued negotiations for new incentive based agreements with the largest TMCs and agencies. We now have new competitive agreements in place with more than half of those and are in advanced negotiations with the rest. We rebuilt our agency support capability and based on the team's NPS scores, they're providing world class service. These agreements combined with the support enhancements are major steps towards restoring our share in these important distribution channels. In September, we announced the relaunch of our corporate experience program to address feedback from our corporate customers. The program provides meaningful benefits including priority boarding, access to preferred seats, and priority re-accommodations during disruptions. Additionally, we have amended agreements with many of our top corporate customers. Adoption of AAdvantage Business, our program tailored for small and medium sized businesses, continued to build during the quarter. Our actions to expand the benefits, which include bookings through agencies, enhanced program support, and a more simplified enrolment process are clearly working. We expect to accelerate the growth of the program going forward. Concurrently, we've been engaged with our corporate and agency partners to ensure we're addressing the issues that matter most to our customers. We've heard universally that their worlds are better with three airlines rather than two, because of the network and travel rewards program that America delivers. Based on this feedback, we're confident we're taking the right actions. We know full restoration of our revenue will take some time, but with the progress we're seeing and the actions underway, we aim to fully restore our revenue from indirect channels as we exit 2025. We will continue our relentless focus on reestablishing relationships with our business customers, reembracing the agency channel, and making it easier to do business with American. Now turning to our operations. The American Airlines team delivered strong operational results in the third quarter, including outperforming our network peers over the peak summer travel period. These results were accomplished despite extended periods of difficult weather in several key hubs and continued supply chain challenges. Despite these obstacles, American led the U.S. network carriers in completion factor in the third quarter. This is a testament to our team's ability to plan and deliver a safe, reliable and consistent product for our customers. Earlier, I mentioned the financial impact of the CrowdStrike outage and hurricanes Debbie and Helene. The cost of those disruptions could have been far greater, if not for our team's quick recovery, which was a result of our focus and investment in the resiliency of our operation. As we closed the quarter in September and have transitioned into the fall, we're seeing some of the best operational performance of the year. And as promised at our Investor Day, American is delivering strong operational results. And moving forward, we expect to produce the same operational reliability even more efficiently. Now I'll turn it over to Devon to share more about our third quarter financial results and the fourth quarter outlook.\nDevon May: Thank you, Robert. Excluding net special items, we reported a third quarter net income of $205 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.30. We produced record third quarter revenue of $13.6 billion, up 1.2% year-over-year. Our unit revenue was down 2% year-over-year on 3.2% more capacity. Our adjusted EBITDAR margin was 11.1%, and we produced an adjusted operating margin of 4.7%. Our unit cost, excluding net special items and fuel, was up 2.8% year-over-year. This is at the higher end of our guidance range, due in part to expenses associated with the CrowdStrike disruption and two major hurricanes. Moving to our fleet. For 2024, we now expect to take delivery of 17 new aircraft, seven of which are planned to be delivered between now and the end of the year. Our 2024 aircraft CapEx, which also includes used aircraft purchases, spare engines and net PDPs is expected to be approximately $1.7 billion and our total CapEx is expected to be approximately $2.6 billion, a reduction of $300 million from our July guidance. Looking ahead to 2025, based on our current expectation for new deliveries, we anticipate our aircraft CapEx will be less than $3 billion, below the low end of our prior guidance range. We continue to expect moderate levels of CapEx through the end of the decade, with aircraft CapEx planned to average between $3 billion and $3.5 billion per year from 2026 to 2030. We ended the third quarter with $11.8 billion of total available liquidity. We produced approximately $170 million of free cash flow in the third quarter and have now produced $2.4 billion of free cash flow through the first three quarters of the year. We are on track to reduce our total debt by at least $13 billion from peak levels by the end of this year, and we remain committed to our goal of $15 billion of total debt reduction from peak levels by year-end 2025. Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. As we noted in July, we moved quickly to adjust our capacity growth in the back half of the year to better align with demand. With our schedule for the balance of the year now finalized, we expect to grow capacity by approximately 1% to 3% in the fourth quarter, and we expect our full year capacity will be up approximately 5% to 6%, in line with our prior guidance. We expect fourth quarter TRASM to be down 1% to 3%, and full year TRASM to be down 3% to 4% versus 2023. We continue to focus on driving efficiency and productivity through our reengineering the business initiatives. We are on track to deliver $400 million in cost savings this year with $300 million achieved through the third quarter. Additionally, we continue to expect to achieve more than $300 million in working capital improvements this year. Fourth quarter CASMx is expected to be up approximately 4% to 6% year-over-year. The higher sequential year-over-year unit cost growth is primarily driven by lower capacity growth and the impact of our new agreement with the APFA. We expect our full year CASMx to be up approximately 2% to 3%, consistent with the guidance we provided in January, as we continue to effectively manage expenses. Our current forecast for the fourth quarter assumes a fuel price of between $2.20 and $2.40 per gallon. Based on our current demand assumptions and fuel price forecast, we expect to produce an adjusted operating margin of between 4.5% and 6.5% for the fourth quarter or earnings of approximately $0.25 to $0.50 per diluted share. With this fourth quarter guidance, we expect to deliver a full year adjusted operating margin of between 4.5% and 5.5% and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.35 to $1.60. We now expect to generate between $1 billion and $1.5 billion of free cash flow in 2024. This includes the impact of a one-time bonus for our flight attendants of approximately $500 million. As we prepare for 2025, we are focused on producing capacity that is in line with our expectation of demand growth. While capacity planning for the year ahead is ongoing, we currently expect our 2025 capacity to grow low-single digits year-over-year. This growth will be focused on bringing back capacity in markets that are still not restored to historical levels. As we demonstrated with the capacity adjustments we put in place in the back half of this year, we will remain flexible and will adjust capacity in response to the demand environment and the competitive environment we are operating in. I'll now turn the call back to Robert for closing remarks.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Devon. We remain focused on operating a reliable airline, executing on our initiatives and delivering results. We continue to produce historically strong operational reliability. We remain on track to achieve our balance sheet goals. We're reengineering the business to ensure we continue to manage costs with the best in the industry, while delivering a better experience for our customers and team. With the changes we're making in our commercial organization, we're setting the foundation for success as we regain our share of corporate and agency revenue. We will continue to make progress on those efforts, listening to customer feedback and tracking our performance to ensure the changes we're making are producing the expected returns. Winning back the full share of revenue that we've lost will take some time, but we're committed to reaching that objective as we exit 2025 and get back on track with the long-term targets we outlined at our Investor Day, and that's growing our margins, generating sustainable free cash flow, and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet through debt reduction. To accomplish this, we need the entire American Airlines team working together and pulling in the same direction. With the ratification of the new contract with the APFA and our tentative agreement with the TWU-IAM Association, which covers our mechanics and fleet service team members. We've reached new agreements covering more team members in a shorter period of time than ever before. Not only do these agreements ensure we're taking care of our team, but they also provide a level of certainty in our planning that will help us efficiently achieve the goals we've set for American. We're focused on delivering on our commitments, and we believe achieving our long-term targets will unlock significant value. And with that, operator, please open the line for analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Go ahead, Andrew.\nAndrew Didora: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Yes. First question for Robert. I guess, when I look at your total revenue growth, it's been sort of flattish in four of the last six quarters here. Obviously, trailing GDP, but also the other global carriers. Do you think you can get back to GDP type style to top line growth and what do you need to see to get there from here?\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Andrew. I appreciate that. And the answer to that is for sure. So I'll start with this, that we did some damage to ourselves with our sales and distribution strategy. You've heard us talk a lot about that. I'm really pleased with what I see in terms of recovery of that. We grew our corporate managed business in the third quarter by 6%, we can do better than that. And I know that that's something that we can achieve. As we take a look at the efforts that we've put in place to win back that share, whether that's restoring full content, negotiating new deals and enhancing existing deals with our agency partners and also our corporate partners, that's all under work, and it's taking root and it's showing in terms of our forward bookings. As I mentioned earlier today, we bottomed out at corporate and agency indirect share compared to historical averages of about 11% down. And as we exit September, we know that we've recovered back to about 7% down. So I see that progress continuing. On top of that, I'll speak to the strength of our network and our partnerships and competing just from a product perspective. And then finally, I know that we'll make some progress in being more competitive in terms of our co-brand relationship and what that can bring to our business as well. So I've got a lot of confidence and pleased with the progress that I see so far.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. And on that co-brand perspective, I guess, there was a press article last month that spoke about you potentially consolidating your card program with just Citi. Where do negotiations stand with regards to new economics there? And I think at Investor Day, you were talking about maybe timeline by year-end 2024 in terms of potential timeline of getting a deal across the finish line. Does that still seem reasonable? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Good. Thanks for the question. I'm going to hand that over to Steve.\nSteve Johnson: Hey. Thanks, Andrew. We have two really exceptional friends and partners in Citi and Barclays. And I want to give a shout-out, we've worked together to create a really terrific program that I think has a sensational future. I think, in terms of talking about our progress, I'm actually going to give a salute to, the Dodgers, and more importantly, to Steve Trent, who actually framed this question in July in terms of a baseball game. And I'd say that I'd characterize our progress as the bottom of the seventh inning at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Scott.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So RASM was down 2% in the third quarter, I presumably improved throughout the quarter. The fourth quarter guide down 1% to 3%, I guess, doesn't really imply any incremental improvement. Any color on why? And then maybe any regional color?\nRobert Isom: So Scott, I'll start. First off, as we take a look at the fourth quarter, I do see strong demand overall, but it's a quarter in which a strong October, and I think a strong December has some noise in it, in terms of expected softness in demand around the election, around Halloween. But as we take a look at how bookings have progressed, I see that October very strong, December very strong. And as we look out into 2025, same holds true for what we have on the books for January as well. We've got some capacity growth in the quarter, but it's modest, it's been reduced considerably. And we're going to work hard to make sure we deliver on the forecast that we've produced.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just secondly, you made a comment about low-single digit capacity growth for '25. What do you think that -- any early thoughts on what that should mean for CASM? And then, you sound confident about the corporate recovery by the end of '25. What's the revenue opportunity from that?\nDevon May: Hey, Scott. It's Devon. Yeah. We're not going to give CASM guidance for 2025 right now. But as you'd expect, the largest headwind we faced in 2025 are the increases in salaries and benefits resulting from the CBAs that we have reached over the past 18 months. We expect the competitors are going to have very similar CASM pressure. But for us, it's nice to have the certainty in planning, also magnifies the importance of all of our efforts to run a lean operation and invest in the right technology to run a more efficient and effective business. But that's -- the main area will be on salaries and benefits. There'll be some other cost pressures, things like regional growing at a faster rate than mainline. But I feel we've been the best in the business at managing our expenses over the past several years, and it will be a focus of ours in 2025 as well.\nRobert Isom: And Scott, in terms of revenue, last quarter, I said that we think that in terms of higher yielding corporate and agency related revenue, we're missing out about $1.5 billion of revenue over a course of the year. Now we've replaced some of that with lower yielding traffic. But our intent is to win the vast majority of that back over the course of 2025. And based on the efforts that we're taking right now, I feel confident we'll be able to do that. The cycle in which contracts are established for agencies and corporates, it's done on an annual basis. And sometimes it even takes -- sometimes those contracts actually run over the course of a couple of years. But what we're seeing right now is a lot of reception. People want us back. I've talked to not only buyers and purchasing team members from our corporates and TMCs, but also the CEOs, the world is better for them with another competitor in the mix. And so there's a lot of positive reaction to us getting more competitive, offering the services and amenities that are competitive.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Linenberg: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Robert, I want to touch back on the distribution chart where you show that sequential improvement. I get maybe every point is about $140 million on an annual basis. Where are we with the $1.5 billion hole? Is that still the hit this year despite the fact that we are starting to see improvement right now? And the fact that we are seeing this type of improvement, it doesn't seem like you're really incorporating much of it in the fourth quarter given the flat RASM -- or excuse me, the down 1% to 3% RASM guide, similar to what you did in the September quarter?\nRobert Isom: Thanks for the question. I'll just start with this. We've taken a very deliberate approach as we've sat down with our agency partners and corporate buyers. We've seen tremendous progress, as I said, evidenced by forward bookings, but not a lot of that has showed up in the third quarter. We expect to see more as we progress into the fourth quarter, and then acceleration as we move into 2025. Again, we've got to give a chance for the contracts to actually be in place, changes to be made. And then ultimately, I'm looking for restoration on an accelerated basis as we move into 2025.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. And then just a capacity question. I do see that your supply is down a bit in some of your international markets like Transatlantic. Presumably that's being driven by airplanes that are going through a reconfiguration. Can you just talk about that reconfiguration program and maybe how many wide bodies it will take out of your fleet as you expand your premium offering? Thanks for taking my questions.\nRobert Isom: No. Thanks for that. And in terms of aircraft reconfigurations, 777-300, the 20, 777-300s that we have, they are due to start their reconfigurations next year. And we'll be talking more about that as we get into our 2025 planning cycle. But there's not any of that as we take a look into fourth quarter. More of what you're seeing is us just aligning the capacity to where we can best utilize the aircraft and quite frankly, serve our customers and generate the most revenue. So one of the things you've seen is that capacity has been, I think, brought more into balance in London Heathrow and that bodes well for us. We're certainly seeing that in stronger London Heathrow yields. Transatlantic, as we move into the fourth quarter overall appears to be very solid. And so, it's more an aircraft deployment issue. As we get into 2025, we'll be able to say more about impact of reconfigurations on our wide body fleet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan Securities. Your question, please, Jamie.\nJamie Baker: Hey. Good morning, everybody. So if we look at the third quarter, non-GAAP earnings were pretty similar to those of last year's third quarter, but on fuel that was $0.40 a gallon lower. If we look at the guide for the fourth quarter, at the midpoint of EPS, you're obviously up year-on-year, but on fuel, it's $0.70 lower. The point is, if we normalize for fuel, your core in the fourth quarter year-on-year looks like it's doing worse than in the third quarter. What do you think explains that?\nDevon May: Hey, Jamie. It's Devon.\nJamie Baker: Hi, Devon.\nDevon May: I think as we've always talked about, there's a relationship between fuel and revenue. So we have adjusted capacity, the industry has adjusted capacity to the current supply environment. Obviously, if fuel was $0.70 higher, we would be producing slightly less capacity than we are today. I think the industry would probably be adjusting at the same time. So none of this can be looked at in isolation. You're right that earnings in the fourth quarter relatively flat, just up slightly at the midpoint. We expect to do better than that. And as we head into 2025, we're looking forward to margin expansion.\nJamie Baker: And second -- and thanks, Devon. When we think about management priorities, Robert has said that he's spending a lot of time helping repair corporate relationships and progress is being made and operations are markedly improved. The balance sheet continues to improve. There's loyalty kicker coming. These are all good things. My question relates to the network. I'm curious, what you think your greatest network deficiencies are? And more importantly, does management have the appetite or is it a priority to address those deficiencies? Thanks in advance.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Jamie. And look, our highest priorities right now are making sure that we make best use of the assets that we have, and notably regaining our corporate and agency share, getting our co-brand credit card renegotiated, and then competing with -- on product and service. But in regard to the network, look, we said it at the Investor Day, and I'll underscore it again. We have a fantastic network. It can take customers anywhere they want to get in the world. We have the best set of partnerships in the biggest business and travel destinations around the world. We've been aggressive in the past in terms of making sure that we shore up any deficiencies. Most notably, we have a relationship with Alaska Airlines on the West Coast. We tried to strengthen our position on the East Coast with the NEA. And as we take a look at going forward, we're very focused on making sure our network appeals to customers from a leisure basis, international, and certainly from a business perspective. And as you take a look at what we're doing in New York and Los Angeles, I'll note that in New York, between LaGuardia and JFK, that we have -- we will be flying as we move into next year, the largest schedule that we've had since the pandemic. I'm really pleased with the product that we're putting in place, whether it's the lounges, the 321Ts and ultimately, the XLRs that will be flying Transcon, the great relationship that we have with BA to set up just the best shuttle to London Heathrow, and the work that we're doing out on the West Coast, again, with Alaska. Our combined position certainly puts us in great strength. And even on our own, in the L.A. basin airports, we have considerable strength. So it’s about knitting all these things together and utilizing to the greatest extent, for greatest benefit for our customers and making sure that we do our best to yield up wherever we can. We’ve got a lot of work ahead of us, but that’s all upside with the assets that we have today.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth of Raymond James. Please go ahead, Savi.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good morning. I was wondering if you could, just to kind of follow up on Scott's question earlier, provide a little bit more color on the fourth quarter trend here. And you called out noise, election. I think, I was not sure if there was a Milton impact in there. I wonder if you could just help us understand the unit revenue guide that you provided and what the core trend might be both kind of in the domestic and the various international markets?\nRobert Isom: Yeah. Savi, what I'll say is, we -- take a look at the fourth quarter overall. And I'd say, again, there's strength in demand. We're not going to have any trouble filling up our planes. I do think that that's a result of the supply and demand balance being relatively more in shape. And I think that that's going to progress as well. I think that, from a supply perspective, we're going to see improvement. But the fourth quarter as a whole, strong October, some weakness in early parts of November as a result of Halloween and the election. Not unexpected. And in the fourth quarter, we see a lot of strength, I'm sorry, as we move to December, see a lot of strength around the holidays, see a lot of strength over Thanksgiving as well. So people want to travel, and we're very optimistic about how the bookings look for the fourth quarter.\nSavanthi Syth: I appreciate that. And then, just on the -- I know, it's very early days on the 2025 capacity growth, and I appreciate the color there. Just curious, in connection to the unit cost headwinds mentioned maybe a little bit more regional growth than mainline. I was curious, if you can talk about high level how you're thinking about kind of domestic growth versus maybe near international versus international?\nDevon May: Hey, Savi. Not a whole lot of color at this point on growth by entity for 2025. But obviously, the regional growth will be entirely focused on domestic. It just doesn't drive a ton of ASMs. But as we bring back capacity, there's probably 1% of consolidated capacity or more that's coming out of regional that will largely be on the domestic side. The rest of the growth, I think, will be split relatively evenly, maybe a little more international than domestic. But we have to let our plans develop a bit.\nRobert Isom: And Savi, just a little more color on that. Coming out of the pandemic, we really focused on restoring our SunBelt hubs to get them to full capacity. You'll see us position more capacity than the northern tier hubs. Regionals are going to give us a great flexibility in being able to make sure that we can take customers where they want to go when they want to go.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Your question, please, Conor.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Maybe following up to Jamie's question. On the product side, you're talking to your corporates now pretty in depth, and I imagine you're engaging with regular customers in general. But just have preferences changed at all in terms of onboard experience? You have United talking about free Wi-Fi, you have Southwest rolling out their premium experience. Just curious on how you view -- how American's product kind of stacks up to the industry at this point? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: Yeah. Thanks, Conor. I'll start with this. There's clearly a preference for more premium type services. And one of the things you'll note in our results is premium revenues have risen by 8% quarter-over-quarter in 2023 -- over the third quarter in 2023. I think that bodes well for us because it's paid load factor and its yield. But it bodes well for us because you'll see over the course of the next two years through 2026 that our premium seating is going to grow by about 20%. And that's as a result of the reconfiguration of 777-300s, but as well as the introduction of the 787-9s with the flagship suites, XLRs, and then also domestically, reconfiguration of our 320s and our 319s. So there's absolutely a preference from that perspective. I think that that's going to continue. I think we're going to be on the right side of the ledger on that. In terms of product, you mentioned customers want control and convenience. We've invested an incredible amount in terms of technology, and we'll continue to do that to give customers the ability to control their itineraries and then also to be able to help them recover when there are any type of disruptions as part of that. People want to be connected whenever and wherever they fly. American was the first to get our narrow-body fleet fully equipped with satellite based Wi-Fi. We're going to be expanding that for our large regional jet portfolio as well. So it will be the first to have satellite-based Wi-Fi on the combined narrow-body and regional fleet. And I think that we're going to have to take a look at making sure that we serve customers' needs from that perspective as well, but you'll see us invest in our product. We'll have flagship suites in terms of new deliveries on the XLRs and the 787-9s, those will have seatback video. Those will also have international satellite Wi-Fi as well. And then from a services perspective, on the ground, same thing. We were the first to really up the game in terms of lounge experience with flagship dining. And I'm really proud of the facility that we have in New York with three lounge options that really set a standard. You'll see us next year invest and roll out new lounge experiences in Philadelphia and planning upgrades in other places throughout the system as well. So as we take a look out in the future, I think that customers are looking to having a more premium experience. We're going to accommodate that. They want more control. We're going to make sure that we'll engage them on that front. And overall, I think that the game plan for American is going to be very beneficial in unlocking a lot of value from a revenue perspective.\nConor Cunningham: Super detailed, appreciate that, Robert. And then, you're talking about renegotiation with corporates engaging with them again. Is that in line with your expectations, the exit rate? And then, the word that caught me by surprise, I think, was just you dropped the word competitive as you renegotiate the contract. Does that mean that the revenue recapture that you're seeing is coming in at a lower margin going forward? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: I'll start on this, and Steve can fill. First off, I'll just restate that the reaction I've received from the countless CEOs and professionals at agencies and corporate buying groups has been, thank goodness, you're back. We want to engage. We want to engage in a way that is sustainable and profitable over the long run. So I've been very, very pleased with the reception. Steve, do you want to give some more detail?\nSteve Johnson: Yeah. Sure. Maybe more generally about the third quarter, because there's been a couple of questions that I'd characterize as kind of why is it taking so long. But I mean we -- when I think about the last 90 days, we had a handful of objectives, I think that were immediate and needed to be focused on. I mean, first, we had to stabilize the ship and refocus the team. We'd had a very significant disruption, and I'm really pleased with the progress that we made on that. Second, we needed to rebuild our foundation and our infrastructure for being able to participate in the traditional sales and distribution channels. I mean that had largely been dismantled. And we needed to build that in a way that it would be lasting and that our partners would trust the fact that we were back in the game. And I think we made a really -- we made really significant progress on that. Third, and I think most importantly, we needed to reestablish and start redeveloping our relationships. I mean, that meant listening and listening to a lot of people. And ultimately, getting past a stage that was really anger and getting -- reacquainting ourselves with these people and regaining their trust in a way that was really important. That meant talking to people, it meant negotiating agreements on a kind of counterparty-by-counterparty basis. And it just meant engagement. And as Robert had said a couple of times, I mean, that's been really positive. We made a lot of progress on that. And we've heard over and over and over again that the agencies, the TMCs, our corporate customers, that their world is better with three airlines competing instead of just two. Fourth, we wanted to shift some share. We talked about that, and we said that we would measure ourselves by share, and we accomplished that, as Robert has mentioned a couple of times. Fifth, we wanted to outperform guidance. We hadn't done that in a long time. And we did that this time, and I think everybody is really proud of that effort. And then finally, we wanted to -- we wanted that outperformance to be meaningful and meaning that we wanted to do it in a way that we didn't lose additional ground to our principal competitors. And I think we accomplished that in the third quarter as well. I mean, I’m not going to say that we’re done or anything nearly that. There’s tons of work to be done. But I’d like to think that that’s a solid start, and I think it has the team and Robert and Devon and I really excited about what we can accomplish in the next 90 days and in 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, Duane.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Just a couple. On the fleet delays, I'm just wondering how impactful these are to your 2025 planning, if you have any sense for what your 2025 growth might have looked like absent any fleet delays or is this more about delaying aircraft retirements? And then relatedly, and a follow-up to Savi, how are you thinking about utilization expansion next year, which I think was a big theme entering this year?\nRobert Isom: Hey, Duane. Yeah. Capacity for 2025 is being impacted by these delays, like, we're fortunate to have a fleet that can run at pretty strong utilization. You saw that this year where, versus the start of the year, we probably took delivery of 15 or 20 less airplanes or something like that, than what we expected and we still met our capacity guidance for the year. Next year, we'd probably be a little bit higher in terms of capacity if it weren't for our expected delays. That being said, we can push utilization a little bit. We still think we could if we wanted to and if the competitive or demand environment dictated, that we could grow ahead of our low-single digit guide, but it is impacted to some extent. On the utilization side for next year, you'll mostly see it with regional aircraft where utilization will be up pretty materially as we have gotten back to full supportability throughout this year. Mainline utilization maybe up slightly, but it won't be as material as what we've seen on the regional side.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. Thanks for that. And then, in terms of corporate share recovery, I don't know if you're willing to speak to this, but where do you think the old strategy hurt you the most geographically? Was the share loss really even across your network, in places like DFW and Charlotte? And Steve, maybe your Dodgers shout-out gives us a clue. I don't want to read too much into it, but where do you think this pivot will help you most?\nSteve Johnson: Clearly, in the big cities that are the most competed, New York, L.A., Chicago. We definitely were hurt disproportionately in places where we're less strong. And so -- and that's what we're seeing -- as we see this start to come back, that's where it's starting to come back.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent of Citi. Your line is open, Steve.\nStephen Trent: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen and thanks taking my time – taking the time for my questions, and to the other, Steve, on the call, we're quite baseball focused here as well, so appreciate that. Just a bit of a follow-up when I think about maintenance. I know you guys have a relatively young fleet, but have you thought about maybe other strategies, engine module swaps or using drones or these kind of things when you think about your aircraft maintenance strategy? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: So I'll start. And just first with this, I think as we move out into 2025 and beyond, I think that the industry is going to continue to have a shortfall of resources. American is very well protected and resourced in an environment where the supply chain struggles, especially around maintenance related items. We have the largest group of mechanics, all represented by the TWU-IAM Association of any carrier. We have the world's largest commercial maintenance overhaul base in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And in all of that, I know right now from what I see that we're outperforming others in the industry, whether that be other airlines and also MROs. I know that because of the kind of the turn times that we produce on our CFM56 engines. So I think we're really well positioned in a world where there's constrained resources. On top of that, and I'll let David Seymour, our Chief Operations Officer to speak, I know as well that we're bringing to bear the best in terms of technology to not only maintenance but all aspects of the operation.\nDavid Seymour: Yeah, Robert. Thank you. The team is exploring all this, and that's new technology that's out there, but we're looking at whether it's drones or using high definition cameras to be able to pinpoint damage, assess damage, and those types of things that we would do ordinarily in a heavy check environment. So that field is starting to grow. We're definitely exploring options in that to get more efficient with what we do.\nRobert Isom: And David, I'll just add this. Technology is going to be a key item for us as we look forward. When we talk about aircraft utilization, we start identifying any type of improvement [Technical Difficulty] right now in a way that I think we can recover better than any other airline. We're using that technology and the tools that David mentioned in terms of our training. And one of the things that you'll see is that through deployment of basically, iPads throughout the system, whether that be for our pilots and flight attendants and ultimately, for our mechanics out on the line, their job has become so much easier. So this is something that we're going to excel in. We're already really strong, and it's going to be a differentiator for the company.\nStephen Trent: Very helpful. Thank you very much. And just a quick follow-up as well, all the changes you're making with corporate and what have you. Have you contemplated making any adjustments or any other adjustments in your frequent flyer program? For example, some of your competitors have mileage programs where their points don't expire? Thank you.\nRobert Isom: So from a loyalty perspective, look, we’re really proud of the AAdvantage program overall. We’re constantly looking at ways to better engage our customers, not only from a loyalty perspective, but just also from a value perspective. And while there may be some carriers that are doing something different, I do know one thing that you take a look at any type of assessment of the value of a mile on American Airlines versus anyone else, you’ll see that we absolutely generate more value for our customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Fitzgerald of TD Cowen. Your line is open, Tom.\nThomas Fitzgerald: Thanks so much for the time, everyone. Thinking about the Wi-Fi, and if that free Wi-Fi starts to become table stakes across the industry, are you concerned at all about the revenue headwind that could present?\nRobert Isom: Tom, thanks for the question. No, I'm not concerned because, first off, you need to have high-speed Wi-Fi to be able to offer it at any level to give customers confidence that they'll be able to access and use it. We're going to be expanding coverage for our Wi-Fi. As I mentioned, our regional fleet will have it along with our narrow-body fleet. And we're going to be really competitive. We're going to make sure that our customers are taken care of and what they want, especially our most loyal customers. We're going to make sure that they're protected and taken care of. We already offer a number of opportunities for our customers to engage with us on a fee basis, and also on a free basis with some partners. We'll keep an eye on that and make sure that we don't fall short even for a second. Thanks.\nThomas Fitzgerald: That's really helpful. Thanks. And then just quickly on the -- with the CapEx, some of that shifting to the right, would you look to accelerate any debt pay down? Thanks again for the time.\nDevon May: It's a good question and a fair question. Right now, we feel pretty good about the outlook. With what we're doing on total debt reduction, we've stayed consistent with our goal of $15 billion of total debt reduction. Right now, we have two maturities in 2025 that we'll have some options around whether we do a refinancing on those maturities or if we pay down, and that will be dependent on where we are at with free cash flow and our liquidity outlook. But for now, we're feeling really good about the $15 billion total debt reduction goal. And yeah, we may look to advance that or further reduce debt depending on what happens throughout 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel McKenzie of Seaport Global. Please go ahead, Daniel.\nDaniel McKenzie: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Going back to technology being a key item and your comment on IT investments. I understand not going to drive improved maintenance, but on revenue, is there a revenue opportunity from getting the right offer in front of the customer at the right time? And for those with a longer time frame, what does the upside look from -- look like from that potential upsell?\nRobert Isom: So I'll start. Steve, you can add on to this as well. I'll just start with this, Dan. First off, we've invested billions, $12 billion, in terms of technology over the last decade. And that kind of investment is going to continue as part of where we focus our efforts, and whether it's in operations, which David covered to a certain extent, or our operations control, which is definitely something that is an area of focus, attention is on our customers, making sure that we're as easy to do business as possible, that they can afford themselves of everything that they want in terms of services and amenities, and that they have the control for that. So you'll continue to see us invest in things that make us easy to do business with. And as part of that, and tying back to our product strategy, we know customers want access to more premium products. Making that available to them in an easy fashion is going to be a focus. I'm not going to put a number on it right now, but it's a big effort. Steve?\nSteve Johnson: Thanks, Robert. Dan, I'd just add, I, as you might guess, spend most of my time focusing on some of the issues that we've been discussing over the last two earnings calls, but all of my free time is focused on excitement about what new technologies and artificial intelligence can do to help us both deliver better products to customers, more tailored products to customers, engage better with our customers, and ultimately improve revenues. It's really an exciting part of the business, and we are very focused on it. Thanks for the question.\nDaniel McKenzie: Yeah. And I guess, if I could just follow up with one more on AI driving improved efficiency, because that's exactly what I was getting at. Bigger picture, what do you want the efficiency metrics to look like, say, one or two years from now? And what kind of cost savings could that potentially imply?\nRobert Isom: So Dan, I'll start, Devon can add into this. Look, we're intent on margin expansion. And one of the efforts that I asked Devon to take on now well over a year ago, almost we're 1.5 years into it was reengineering the company from an efficiency perspective. The first effort down that path was really to make sure that we're getting the most out of the assets that we have today, the relationships that we have today, so everything from purchasing to freeing up working capital, to just doing things in a better fashion -- a little bit better fashion than we do today. Those efforts have paid off. I think that in Devon's comments you mentioned that we're on track for producing $400 million in terms of savings in 2024, which will grow as we move into 2025, freeing up working capital as well. We're not going to stop at this first effort in terms of reengineering. The next effort will then be to put an AI lens to everything that we do. And on that front, I'm really pleased with the collaboration between Devon May, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ganesh Jayaram, our Head of Information Technology and Digital. They're both on it, and we look forward to talking more about our efforts as we get into 2025.\nDevon May: I really don't have much to add. We're really proud of the progress we have made so far to drive efficiencies in the business. I think it's a huge opportunity ahead. You're going to see it in metrics like we talked about at Investor Day, things like this year, we're growing the airline 5.5%, but we're growing our head count by 1%. I think you’ll see the same types of outcomes as we invest more into Gen AI and other technologies that are going to allow us to better utilize our assets, better utilize our people and better serve our customers.\nOperator: Thank you, analysts, for your questions. At this time, the line is open to media. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg. Your line is open, Mary.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you. Good morning. Hey. As you guys work on your corporate rebuilding strategy and trying to win back business, can you say at this point, what was the main point of where you went wrong? At what point did you realize that your strategy was the wrong strategy and how did you get to that point? If you can just kind of maybe break that down just a little bit.\nRobert Isom: So Mary, I'll repeat what I said in the second quarter. Look, our revenue performance fell off as we moved into the second quarter of this year, it became noticeable. And it would be something -- and something that we knew we had to address. In terms of the efforts that we were trying to bring about, which is technology change and really trying to spur the marketplace, we have to be conscious of the competitive environment. We have to be conscious of technology. And most importantly, we have to be conscious of what our customers want at the end of the day. We absolutely can do a better job listening. Steve is engaged on that front. I'm pleased with the progress we're making in getting back and reestablishing our commitment to customers. And I know that the revenue rebound is going to follow from that effort.\nMary Schlangenstein: So do you feel in retrospect like there wasn't perhaps enough oversight to make sure, before you lost business, that you weren't taking the wrong steps?\nRobert Isom: Mary, this is an opportunity for us, and it's upside at American. As we regain our share, that's something that I think that is unique to American. And we're intent on doing that and serving our customers how they want to be served. And in that case, we have a lot of customers that really want to invest in technology and move forward. We have other customers that really want to take a different approach. We’re going to make sure that we’re serving them all. We are in the business of taking care of customers, all customers, and making sure that they have a place at American and feel like they’re well taken care of.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC. Your question, please, Leslie.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering, if you have an update on the cabin refurbishment for the 777 and 321. Those seem to be a bit behind schedule. When do you expect those to be complete or make some progress there? And then secondly, do you have any idea if there's kind of a lull in bookings around the election and is it any different in its scale than previous elections? Thanks.\nRobert Isom: Thanks, Leslie. I'll start with the last, which is, look, we expect there to be some distraction around Halloween and the election. We adjusted our capacity to account for that. So it's not surprising. And as I said, October and December certainly looked very strong, and the Thanksgiving holiday as well. So we’re pleased with what we see overall. Just have to be cognizant that during election time and Halloween, there’s usually a little bit of a tapering off of demand. In terms of any reconfigurations we’re doing, we have 777-300s, we have 319s and 320s that will all be going into modification work. Those all vary in terms of timing. The 777-300s are more likely towards the end of -- as we get out of the summer of 2025. Other programs will be started and progress over time. The biggest thing I can say on all those fronts though is that we are dependent on the supply chain. Right now, that supply chain, especially in regard to seats is very tight. And so message to our suppliers, our partners is to work with us to make sure that we get those -- that equipment on dock as expected, and we’re really pushing to make sure that that’s the case right now.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?\nRobert Isom: Well, thanks for that. And thanks, everybody, for making time for us. I will close with this. I’m pleased with the progress that we’re making. It’s great to get back on track, delivering on what we say we’re going to do. That’s been something that I’ve wanted to make sure is a hallmark of American, and we’re going to get back on track to doing that. And to that end, this is about making sure we deliver on some of the things that we talked about at Investor Day. And that is making sure that we have margin expansion, free cash flow production, strengthening of the balance sheet. The kind of things that we talked about today in terms of regaining share, competing vigorously, establishing a new co-brand credit card relationship. All of those are upside for American. So as we work through 2025, I know that these are all going to take root and I’m very optimistic about our future. I want to give a shout out to our team. It’s never been harder to run an airline. And with industry-leading reliability and circumstances that we have, I think it’s just an incredible accomplishment. Thank you very much for your time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "fullTranscript": "Rutger Relker: Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our first half '25 results publication. It's great to see so many of you joining this webcast online. I'm happy to introduce to you our CEO, Stephane Simonetta, and our new CFO, Frans den Houter. Stephane will kick off the presentation, with some business highlights. This will be followed by Frans, who will give an update on our financial developments. Stephane will finish the presentation with an update on our strategy, and this will be followed by a Q&A session. Please note that today's webcast and the presentation will be made available later today on our website. Please let me introduce Stephane to kick off the presentation.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you, Rutger. Good morning, everyone. Let's start this presentation by giving you business highlights to tell you how was the first half and give you also an operational update for each of our segments before handing over to Frans about the financial development. And I would like to start with a few key messages to summarize the situation where we are. As you have seen this morning in our press release our first half performance has been impacted by the market headwinds and by the increased uncertainty due to the global trade policies. This has an impact into our organic growth and that's why as a key message of today, we are adjusting our full year outlook to reflect the market condition. But we continue to take action on what we can do to protect our EBITA margin, to optimize our free cash flow and we have made good progress on our strategy with three value-accretive acquisition that we will be sharing later today, two in the U.S., one intended in Southeast Asia for Semicon. At the same time, we are still actively looking at our divestment program to simplify our portfolio, especially within our building and industry segment. So in a nutshell, managing the short-term challenges due to the market uncertainty, but at the same time, continuing to deploy our long-term strategic actions. Now looking back at the first half, you can see on this slide, basically, now you see the key numbers that, again, will be explained in much more detail by Frans. So in a nutshell, the organic growth is basically the result of the end market headwinds. As you can see, we are reporting a 3.2% organic decline with actually a mixed picture between our three segments because, yes, in industry and semicon, we continue to see organic decline. Also, Q2 was a bit better for industry, but semicon continued to be very low. On the other hand, we still have growth in our building segment, we are reporting a moderate organic growth of 1.4%. As a consequence, our margin is basically the result of the organic growth challenges as we have a semicon margin going down following the volume drop. Our industry margin is still solid. Right? And building is stable compared to last year. But of course, we were expecting a bit better performance due to all the actions we are taking. On the other hand, I'm really pleased that, thanks to all the actions we are taking on pricing excellence and organic growth, we managed to sustain a good added value margins and super pleased also to report that we are improving our free cash flow. Thanks to the great work from our team to reduce inventories and also to manage our capital expenditure. As a consequence, due to the lower margin, our EBITA is down at EUR 1.38. So in a nutshell, as you can see at the bottom of the slide, good improvement in free cash flow and EBITA margin under pressure. Let me go now segment by segment. And I would like to start, as you can see here, by our building segment. In a nutshell, our building growth still positive 1.4%. And our EBITA is stable compared to last year, 12.9% compared to 13% last year. Let me now explain you, as you can see on the left of the slide, why our organic growth, you could say, is only 1.4% because actually, it's a mixed picture. On one hand, very good growth to continue in Americas, in Asia Pacific and in some of our product line, commercial valve, industrial valve, prefab solution, we are actually growing quite well. On the other hand, all this growth is offsetted by the challenge we see, especially in Germany and French market, but also in our connection systems in product line, which has been a bit lower than expected. And therefore, our organic growth is only 1.4%. The margin is stable, mostly because of all the action we took, but of course, we were expecting a better margin because all the actions we took are on track, cost out, inventory, footprint, innovation, and that's what we will continue to do to manage the short term uncertainty. So as a nutshell for building segment, good progress on our operational excellence initiatives and lower-than-expected organic growth, but still positive. If you go now to industry, a different picture. Still a solid performance, 16.8%. And as you can see, the second quarter better than the first quarter, especially because the organic growth is also better in the second quarter than in the first quarter. But overall, you can see it on the top left of the slide, it's a minus 5% organic growth. And we are doing very well, especially in aerospace, high growth in our defense, high growth in our power generation, very good growth. Also in APAC and Middle East. And unfortunately, this good growth are offsetted by the organic decline of the automotive market. And again, by the French and German industrial markets, which remains soft, and this is where we don't see improvement in the short term. On improvement, I think, we continue to take out all the cost out measure, footprint optimization, and that's why we sustain a solid EBITA, a bit lower than last year. That's what we will continue to do in the future. And to conclude, we're very pleased to report that our acquisition with Paulo is actually well on track. And we already see early signs of contribution in terms of growth and in terms of margin, so confirming the strategic rationale of this acquisition. So to summarize, industry, organic revenue growth, EBITA improved in the second quarter, solid performance. Thanks to all the cost out action we took. And the last segment, semicon. This is where we have the biggest challenge on the organic growth. You see we are reporting a first half at 13% decline revenue. This has an impact in our EBITA margin. And that's why our EBITA margin is down to 11.5%. But this is also where we are very careful in our cost-out action, because we have to manage the short term, but also we have to protect the long term. We don't want to be short of capacity when the market will recover. And we are fully aware that this industry is about long-term growth. And yes, short term, we are challenged, especially on our frame and module, in our machine conditioning. We believe now the inventory adjustment from our semicon customer is coming to an end. And now we are just exposed to the market trend in our semicon market. So what are we doing about it, managing the cost, like I said, still investing for the long term in terms of innovation. And of course, the key highlight, even if it's not finalized, is our intended acquisition with GVT to enter the semicon Southeast Asia market. And I'll come back into that because this is where we will improve and we will enter new area for the future growth of the company. So in a summary, for semicon, we continue to see lower demand, very careful about our Q2 and that's why our EBITA margin is under pressure. But I would say it's also about a choice to not go too low in terms of capability and capacity. And before I hand it over to Frans, I will just report also that we continue to make progress on our environmental performance. I'm really pleased that we sustain or percentage of revenue linked to the sustainability development goal with more than 70% of our revenue. And we continue to take action on our own footprint. And thanks to the work from our teams, we managed to reduce 8% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 intensity. So continue to be on track and made good progress in the first half of the year. That's what I wanted to report as a key business highlights. And now let me hand it over to our CFO, Frans, to share with you a more update about our financial development. Thank you. Frans?\nFrans den Houter: Thank you very much, Stephane and Rutger, and good to be with you here this morning and discuss the H1 results of Aalberts. But before I do that, I want to thank all the colleagues in Aalberts to give me such a truly warm welcome. I really enjoy being part of the organization, and I look forward to our Thrive 2030 journey. But before we do that, this morning, it's all about the first half year results. So let me dive into those, in this first slide, where you see four important KPIs that basically summarize where we have been working on and where we are in terms of financials. First, on revenue, we see a decline of EUR 62 million, which is organically EUR 50 million, and that translates into the minus 3.2% organic revenue decline, driven by -- explained by Stephane already, building, we still see a small growth. But yes, industry and semicon, clearly lose revenue growth. That translates into an EBITA margin of 13.5%. Yes, that's 1.5% below the previous 6 months of last year. Still a very good added value. As already mentioned, 63% in line with the previous year. And also the net profit of EUR 151 million, translating into EUR 1.38 per share. Of course, we have been working hard to protect our cash position, and I'm pretty pleased with the free cash flow. Also if you compare year-on-year, EUR 8 million up to a number of EUR 56 million. Yes, we lose money on EBITA because yes, that is the translation of the operational step back, but net working capital and CapEx both delivered EUR 18 million and as such, a nice free cash flow of EUR 56 million, and I'll come back to that in a bit more detail. On CapEx, EUR 100 million, we have been trying to rationalize our CapEx programs and phase them out adjusting to market circumstances. EUR 100 million, EUR 70 million improvement year-on-year. Also good to mention that for the full year, we expect CapEx to be at the level of EUR 200 million to EUR 225 million, which is also a bit lower than our earlier guidance. So first half year results impacted by challenging markets. And let's dive a little bit more deep into the year-on-year comparison. Here, we see the revenue coming down with the EUR 62 million already mentioned, EUR 23 million by acquisitions. We added SGP and Paolo to the portfolio. On the other side, we had the divestments of EPC company and then a small currency effect brings us basically to the EUR 50 million revenue decline. As already stated, predominantly driven by industries and semicon, which are in a more difficult period. And I think we'll summarize you at the bottom also driven by the pressure in automotive that is specifically hitting the industry segments. Next slide, we translate and we look at EBITA. Of course, in acquisitions and divestments, we see the same companies, but then the EBITA effect, small currency effect again, and that brings us to the organic decline in EBITA of EUR 35 million. Basically, three things. We lose EUR 11 million in semicon. We lose a similar amount in industry. And then there's the year-on-year effect of the holding elimination line item where we lose EUR 7 million. And I'll give you a bit more context there in two slides from here and give you a breakdown also comparing with last year. So organic decline, mainly driven by the drop-through of the lower revenue that you saw in the previous slide. As said, let's go to free cash flow. Here, we see in the first red bar, the cash -- the lower cash, because of the EBITA that was at the lower level. But then very clearly CapEx focus, rationalizing our programs and phasing them out EUR 18 million recovery in cash position. And then the net working capital also EUR 18 million, driven by lower inventories, which is hard work, driven by collecting receivables and then slightly offset by the payable position that was a bit lower. But also translation, I think, yes, of good quality of cash, that's been a hard work in inventory and collecting receivables to get this EUR 18 million in our cash position. This, I think, nicely summarized lower EBITA offset by lower CapEx and improved net working capital. On the next slide, it's a busy slide, but I think it summarizes really well year-on-year, what has been going on in the segments and the holding elimination. Let me talk you through. I think Stephane commented already, of course, in his intro. In building, you see summarized here, yes, the decline in revenue year-on-year, also because of the divestments, but organic growth of 1.4%, still positive, and I think good to see also the CapEx positions per segment, EUR 25 million, significantly lower than last year as we also try to rationalize CapEx and use the assets that we already have optimally. In industry, 4.9% revenue decline, but the revenue is still at the same level, of course, supported by the two nice acquisitions that we have added. And CapEx level, yes, similar to next year. And also because we are still finishing some greenfields and also the normal replacement CapEx. In semicon, yes, you see the revenue is a relatively big delta. So already explained by Stephane, we remain focused on the mid and the long run also supported by our acquisition that the intended acquisition that we announced but also visible in the CapEx where we keep investing in our footprint, because we really believe that the mid and the long run, this will be the place to be for us. Finally, as I said, holding eliminations. Important line item. Of course, the elimination line item is more an intercompany correction. Let's focus on the minus EUR 10.4 million that we see here, EUR 7 million down versus last year. It's EUR 7 million more cost. But I think, first of all, good to mention that last year, there was proceeds from an insurance claim included in here. So EUR 10.4 million reflects half of it is the normal holding cost that we have, EUR 10 million to EUR 15 million in total per year. So this is for the first 6 months, let's say, EUR 5 million. The other EUR 5 million come from the acquisition cost for the Paulo acquisition and we settled two small claims, and that brings us to EUR 10.4 million on this line item. Well, again, summarized at the bottom, building stable, industry resilience, and semicon clearly under pressure. Now this is a new slide where we review some key balance sheet items. I think it's really important to also have a good look at it, and I'll talk you through. On the left top, you see clearly that our debt position has gone up with EUR 220 million. That basically reflects the Paolo acquisition that we added to the portfolio, and it brings the leverage to a level of 1.6. Towards year-end, the intended acquisition, we hope to close before Christmas. And that, of course, will then increase the leverage ratio, but we will stay below 2, and we will stay comfortably below the leverage ratio ceiling of 2.5 that we always announced. On the right top, the equity and solvability, I think, in a good place, representing a solid company. And at the left bottom, yes, the ROCE is lower than last year, which is a setback. Of course, driven by the lower EBITA, but also in the other -- on the capital employed side, we also see the net debt effect that I just discussed increasing our capital employed. Net working capital, yes, also a translation of good progress already discussed there. We have made progress on inventories, which as Stephane will touch on in a bit more detail, we have been focusing on collecting the cash from our receivables and the payable position year-on-year has come down. So that offsets a little bit, but a nice improvement of our net working capital position. And that, I think, overall, gives a very strong balance sheet that will support the next steps in our Thrive 2030 journey, Stephane. And I think he will tell a bit more what we're doing there.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you, Frans. So you have seen that we continue to remain very disciplined on all our financial KPIs to manage whatever the market challenges. But while we manage the short term, at the same time, we continue to take action for the long term. And that's what I would like to report to you now, how we are doing, what progress did we do in the first half in our four strategic action as per Thrive 2030, as per our last Capital Markets Day in December. First of all, a quick reminder of the four strategic action. You can see from the left to the right, accelerating organic growth, optimizing and simplifying our portfolio, evolving our operating system and driving sustainable entrepreneurship. No change. These are still the action with the goal to refocus our company, rebalance our portfolio, and recharge our three segments. That has not changed. What progress did we do in the first half? You can see it here with a simple scorecard, and this is what we will be reporting to you every half year, every full year. So you can count us to show you the progress every time we are live and disclosing our results. Obviously, the first action, the status is not satisfactory with a negative organic growth in the first half. This has to be improved. But at the same time, we continue to invest in some specific organic growth initiative. We start to see the early sign of improvement. But obviously, it's still too soon to report progress. But I can tell you. So when you look at prefab solutions, when you look at our boiler room technology, when you look at our offering for data center, when you look at our U.S. growth ambition, you all will remember, our plan is still the same, to double our revenue in the U.S. over the next 5 years. Aerospace is doing very well, defense as well and also our semicon, which is all about innovation, system integration and design-to-value. More to come, but obviously, the first half results are behind. On the second action, this is where we are actually making good progress with two closed acquisitions, one intended acquisition. And as I said earlier, we still are working actively to make progress about divestments in our building and industry segments. The third one, the Aalberts way, it's all about the functional excellence, but where we did the biggest progress in the first half is on our operational excellence, footprint optimization, and I'll show you a bit more because we are quite pleased with the progress on our inventory days, reducing 10 days compared to last year. Well on track with our target to be less than 90 days this year and 85 days next year. And on sustainability commitment, also well on track, but let's not forget that also here, it's about investing in our people to ensure we have a future-proof workforce to enable our strategy. And as you can see, almost 400 of our leaders have been trained or went through our leadership development program that, of course, what we will continue to do as we cannot win without our people. Now one example, which I think, it's showing you and it's all not about the size because it's still a modest order book. It's still low revenue, but this is where we are investing. Just showing you an example of a prefab solution that we are doing in our factory with one example of what we ship and sold to data center in London, and we are doing that in Europe. We are also looking at expanding this offering also in other verticals like commercial buildings, and this is also an opportunity in the U.S. So you are talking here about a global vertical and our modular thinking where we can use many of the things we do at Aalberts. You see our expansion vessels, some of the valve, and we are very pleased with the progress, and we are investing in people, in footprint to be part of the growth because that's one of the growth driver for the coming years to come. You can see also in the summary, the three value-accretive acquisition and it's all about growth, it's a growth agenda, which also enable us to keep our leadership position, so obviously, aligned with our strategy. And you can see one closed acquisition for our industry segment with Paulo, in the U.S., one close acquisition in the middle -- on the right, sorry, with Geo-Flo for our building segment in the U.S., and in the middle, still an intend, based on what we announced for our semicon segment to enter Southeast Asia, and let me tell you a bit more about this great opportunity. Because indeed, you could say it's a transformative move for Aalberts. We are going to enter the semicon Southeast Asia market. This is going to open new growth area for us. And the way we do it is by having synergies, intending synergies between GVT and our Aalbert's advanced mechatronics solution. Why we are so excited about it? You are talking here about growth agenda, to support GVT customers and continue their expansion, where we will bring from Aalberts all our internal capability competencies. Second, we can also grow with our current customer and support the regional supply chain footprint development. So you are talking here about commercial growth, synergy, also cost synergy, footprint, commercial, we have many synergy identified. And that's why we still believe and we really plan to close this acquisition by end of the year, because it's going to support our organic growth and also supports our margin profile, as you can see here, synergy that will enhance our profitability and cash. So fantastic opportunity. Let's close it, and I look forward to report more once the acquisition is closed, but not for now. And on divestments, I'm sure you remember the slide from our CMD. And now just a reminder that we are still working on divesting potentially EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million, especially in our building and industry segments, and we hope to make progress in the second half, but that what we're working on at the moment. So based on the same criteria, ability to win and market attractiveness. The Aalberts way, this is where -- as you say, we are quite pleased with the progress. Our operations team did a fantastic job. Look at these numbers. And that's what I like when you talk about functional excellence. Its initiative that deliver results. And you can see now, right, footprint -- and footprint, we are on track with our optimization. But I think, due to the market uncertainty, it's all about scenario planning. We have a task force looking almost on a daily basis of the tariff impact. We have made progress on inventories, as I mentioned, EUR 110 million drop compared to last year, 10 days, EUR 10 million saving on operational productivity on the first half and 14% CapEx reduction going down to EUR 100 million. That's what we will continue to do, and that's why we are building what we call capabilities to invest in resource and to ensure we have a continuous improvement culture, so that we can repeat that year-over-year and not do that as a one-off. Good progress, outstanding work from our team. And on the decarbonization level, also no change. We are still working on our six levers, as per our strategy. And it's actually to achieve two key objectives. The first one is our own footprint, to continue to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission or intensity. Thanks to our energy-efficient programs, thanks to the usage of renewable energies and also to electrification. And the second goal is to help our customers to reach their sustainability targets through smart product design, through circular economy, and also through value chain collaboration. And I always like to say the sustainability agenda is good for the environment, but it's also good for our business and good for our growth agenda. So now you may wonder, based on the current headwind, what do we plan to do as a short term. We understand that the market uncertainty will continue. We understand that the market softness will continue for the second half. So we will continue to take the action that we took in the first half in order to protect our EBITA margin and improve our free cash flow. So continue to pursue organic growth initiatives, deployed the operational excellence program, as we announced last year. Further accelerate cost out, especially building segments and through operation productivity but also purchasing savings, new area, new opportunity, continued inventory reduction, continue with our CapEx reduction and we hope to make progress on divestments in the second half of the year. So overall, whatever are the market headwinds, we still have strong foundation. We have clear priorities, and the full leadership will be focused on execution, is focused on execution, and that's what we will do to manage the short-term challenges. Now as a conclusion, of course, let's go back to our outlook as we have released this morning in our press release. And you could say, based on the current market softness and market softness based on the uncertainty, looking forward, we don't expect an improvement. As you can see in the middle of the slide, we don't expect an organic revenue growth improvement in the second half of the year. Consequently, we are adjusting our full year outlook EBITA margin to 13% to 14%. And you can count on us to continue to take action to protect our EBITA margin, optimize our free cash flow. And while at the same time, we will continue to deploy and invest for the long term, deploying our strategic action as per Thrive 2030. Thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Frans. Thank you, Stephane, for the presentation.\nRutger Relker: [Operator Instructions] I would now like to give the word to Martijn den Drijver from ABN AMRO, ODDO for the first questions.\nMartijn P. den Drijver: Martijn den Drijver from ABN AMRO. I have three questions, one each for each division. I will do them one by one if you'll allow me. The Q2 was softer than in Q1 in terms of organic growth. Is that end market demand softening? Is that destocking? Can you tell us something about customer behavior and what you're seeing there? And in relation to that, you mentioned corrective action taken. Can you elaborate a little bit on what type of actions we're talking about. So that would be question one.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question, Martijn. And you are right that Q2 organic growth was a bit lower than the Q1, I think, especially in our building and semicon market. So semicon, it's basically the continued effect of the destocking for our customers. So seeing no major change. It was expected at least for us. And that's what we have seen in the first half. And the corrective action we took with semicon, as I say, finding the right balance, adjusting costs, but keeping the flexibility and the capacity for the long term. So I think that -- and that's also where we don't see improvement in the second half, so expect the same activity in semicon. On building, actually, you are right, the organic growth has been a bit lower than the first half. And we saw a market, I think, impact, especially in our connection system and in the German market. That's where the second quarter, so it's market driven, but softer than expected. And that's why the growth in the second half, I think, was only 1%, it's a bit lower. And if you look at industry, you have seen actually Q2 organic growth was better than the first quarter, right, from almost minus 7. We reported minus 2. So here, we saw improvement, still negative. So what we plan to do on the corrective action? I think, industry, it's all on track and because the footprint initiatives, the cost out, actually, we expect the benefit higher in the second half than in the first half. So that's why in the first half, almost 17%. I think it's still a solid performance. And in building, it's basically continuing. So the footprint benefit should also come in the second half. We just finished to close one major site at the end of the first semester. Then you continue to take operational productivity, so about flexing our cost in the factory. It's about direct labor, some variable overhead, fixed cost also, a lot of SG&A cost action taken in building, but also in the other segments. And it will not be for the second half, but we are taking a lot of action on purchasing that should help to have a better impact also in 2026, because we are just starting to launch a new initiative on purchasing and basically using the power of our segments across our business team to have more functional scale and also global scale.\nMartijn P. den Drijver: Okay. You've answered quite a number of questions. But to come back on semicon that, that would be my second question. My understanding, you correctly that previously, the statement was, we expect destocking to flush out during the summer. Meaning, more stabilized sales perhaps growing with the market. Are you now guiding for the same type of development in the second half? Is that the right way to think about it? Or do you still expect that flushing out to occur?\nStephane Simonetta: We don't expect improvement in terms of organic growth in the second half. That's our statement. We believe the destocking is coming to an end. That's what we see, but we don't see higher activity and higher requirements from our customers in terms of new equipment.\nMartijn P. den Drijver: Clear. And then the third question is on industry. In the second quarter, as you already pointed out, the EBITA margin was quite strong, 17.2%. You made some remarks about production footprint, operational action. Is that 17.2% sustainable, you think, in H2, given the top line developments?\nStephane Simonetta: As you know, we are not giving outlook by segment. But I can tell you that we expect the benefit in the second half of all the cost out action we took in the first half. On the other hand, we don't expect organic growth improvement in the second half based on the current market condition.\nRutger Relker: I'd like to give the word to Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen.\nChase Coughlan: I have a couple as well, and I'll take them one at a time, please. Maybe also starting off on semicon. Obviously, there's been quite a lot of talk in the market the last few weeks about maybe 2026 expectations for the space being a bit softer than initially anticipated. I'm curious also given the, let's say, the commissioning of your new plants, do you -- what are your expectations there internally? And do you think there's any risk of underutilization for that facility for the coming years?\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question. Let me first report that our new plant is still on track. We have actually equipment being installed and tested. So aligned -- also aligned with the need from our customers to have this new facility ready. And I would say, the market is quite dynamic. There are so many uncertainties that at the moment, we are really focusing on '25 and '26. It's too early to say. There may be growth, it may be stable. We will report when we have more visibility, [indiscernible], I think we can only report that we don't expect a recovery in the second half in '26, still a lot of uncertainty whether there will be growth or not in the semicon market.\nChase Coughlan: Okay. And my second question, going back to building and specifically in Germany, there was another building products player who reported recently, who actually spoke rather positively about Germany saying that there was some inflection in new dwellings and building permits. So I'm curious on where specifically you see so much weakness? Is this more from sort of the renovation side of things? Or if you could elaborate a little bit more on that German market from the building standpoint?\nStephane Simonetta: Yes, it's a -- you are right that we all expect better trend due to all new investments that are happening on the German industry. We just believe it's too soon to promise that second half will be much better. We are still doing well in our boiler room equipment, also in Germany, where we see the biggest pressure is in our connection system. So it's a specific product line. It's not all our product line, but that's what is making us only growth, like I mentioned, with 1% to 2% and a bit lower than what we were expected. So we are expected much higher organic growth. Now on this specific product line, this is where we see the biggest challenge.\nChase Coughlan: Okay. That's clear. And then my final question, I believe you booked a EUR 20 million release of provisions in the P&L in the first half. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on what that was? Or if I misunderstood something there?\nFrans den Houter: Yes, of course. Indeed, the release of provision of EUR 90 million comparing with EUR 2 million last year, and that EUR 90 million is related to restructuring costs that come out of the balance sheet.\nRutger Relker: Well, we have some more people in the queue. So I'd like to get the word to David Kerstens. David?\nDavid Kerstens: I also have three questions, please. I'll take them one by one. First of all, regarding the building segment, you're guiding for similar organic growth trends for the second half of the year. But I was wondering what will be the impact of copper price inflation and potential tariffs of 50% on copper, which should be accretive to top line growth line, but potentially dilutive to margins. What's your view on the impact here, please?\nStephane Simonetta: That's something we are actively working, and I think it's too soon to report if there will be an impact. I can tell you, we have been able to manage in the first half especially in the U.S., thanks to our pricing, all the impact on the tariff. And at the moment, we don't expect major impact based on what we know today, thanks to the latest development. So not something we expect to have a major impact, and that's why we are giving as an outlook, a similar trend for the second half.\nDavid Kerstens: Okay. And then my second question is related to the acquisition of GVT in semicon. I think in December, you highlighted that portfolio optimization, including M&A, should be accretive to margins and drive profitability towards at least 18% by 2030. But GVT seems to have relatively lower EBITA margins. I understand you have not quantified the synergy impact yet. But does it become more challenging in semicon to get to the 18% EBITA margin target by 2030, because of your acquisition strategy here?\nStephane Simonetta: I think, you're absolutely right that, what they have reported in '24, it's not at the level where we want to be in Aalberts. Let's see what they will report for '25. I think this is still within their end. But we are quite excited with the potential synergy that we see, as I mentioned, in terms of commercial synergy, cost synergy, footprint synergy. And we believe, together, we can make it accretive for margin, for organic growth, and for EPS, are still our long-term ambition. So really, it's about the synergy that we have identified during the due diligence process. So let us close the acquisition first and I really hope to be back next year to explain you a bit more in detail our plan to bring it to reach our long-term objective.\nDavid Kerstens: Okay. Great. And then my final question is on the unallocated cost of EUR 10 million in the first half of the year. Frans, you indicated EUR 5 million was related to acquisition costs for Paulo and settled claims, small claims in the first half. What will be the figure for the second half? Will you also have acquisition costs related to GVT in the second half that will get into the same number of around EUR 10 million, so a EUR 20 million number for the full year?\nFrans den Houter: Yes. Thanks. And I think an important one. Indeed, we will have acquisition costs of GVT expected to close this year. So then we will add that as well. That will be a higher number than then to one for Paulo. So the guidance would be that the second half will be a bit higher even than the first half in terms of the normal holding costs, which are between EUR 10 million and EUR 15 million per year. So the guidance would be based on what we now know, EUR 20 million to EUR 25 million for the line item for the full year.\nRutger Relker: It's time for the next person in the queue, which is Kristof Samoy from KBC.\nKristof Samoy: Yes, a few questions have already been answered, but I have two left. First on semicon. In the first quarter, you indicated that you would optimize the cost, but you didn't quantify it. Can you now give us a little bit more color on the exercise you have been doing there in terms of costs, saving potential, and the timing of when these costs and savings will kick in? That's the first one. And then on the recent transaction that you announced and that you hope to close by year-end. At the time of the announcement, 65% of shareholders approved with the transaction. Is there a scenario where you would go ahead with the acquisition, if you don't arrive at 100% of shares, meaning that you could end up in a situation of 80% of shares and a continued listing in Singapore?\nStephane Simonetta: Let me take the first question. And I'm sure you have noticed that actually our margin in the second quarter was a bit better than the first quarter already for semicon, right? Almost 10% versus 12%. So and the action we are taking is, first, to, of course, take out all the variable costs -- variable costs in our factories, in our operations. So that has been taken. We are also adjusting our SG&A to the level, is an absolute minimum, to not compromise the long term. That's basically what we have been doing. We're still trying to do a bit better also on the purchasing side. But that's why we said the 11.5%, 12% is actually, you could say, our choice even if it is not satisfactory compared to last year, but to find the right balance compared to the long-term growth also to be ready to do all the synergy work with the intent acquisition with GVT. That's the action we have been taking. So also in semicon, costs and SG&A has been taken up.\nFrans den Houter: Yes. And then your second question on GVT. And the answer is no. So we really want full control over the company. That's also where bid assumptions are based on, and we're confident that we have an attractive proposition. But that process is, of course, for GVT to comment on. Because it's a discussion between their management and their shareholders. But we're confident we have a good proposition for them. So let's wait the coming months, how that will work out.\nRutger Relker: Now I'd like to give the word to Christoph Greulich, Berenberg.\nChristoph Greulich: Also two from my side, please, if I may. And the first one is regarding the semicon business. I was wondering after the minus 13% organic growth that we've seen in H1, if you could roughly quantify how much of that is attributed to customers destocking compared to general underlying end market trends? And then I was wondering, implied in your guidance for the second half that we see a similar organic growth trend. If you look at the comp base, I mean, that gets a lot easier, especially in Q4. So if I take into account the easier comp base, does that actually mean that the situation is getting worse from here? Yes, that will be my first question. And then the second topic would be the GVT acquisition. If you could just remind me what is the timeline to reach or obtain the shareholder approval? And then, also in the press release, you are flagging an immediate EPS accretion. Yes, could you quantify that what are you expecting there in 2026 and taking into account the financial expenditure -- expenses for the investment?\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question. Let me take the first one on the semicon. So in the first half, most of it is coming from destocking that we have seen from all our customers. As you remember, it started in Q4, and that has been the major driver. We see lower demand. And that's what we don't see at the moment. Second half getting better. That's why we are adjusting our outlook. We don't see that it will be worse, but we don't see an improvement in the second half of the year. That's basically the reason for adjusting our outlook. When you talk about the GVT acquisition, I think the vote is expected in September. So that's why we also report that following the vote, we expect to close before end of the year. And you understand that before we talk about all the synergies and all the potential, like the previous question, our first priority is to close this acquisition, then we can be more open and transparent about all the synergies and action and opportunity we see following this acquisition.\nChristoph Greulich: Yes, that's very clear. And just maybe to confirm. So when you provided the guidance for H2 semicon, you took into account that the comp base is getting a lot easier in Q4.\nStephane Simonetta: We took all the latest outlook from all our customers because we have, of course, have a good collaboration with them, and that's what we believe is a realistic outlook. There are still opportunity like our customers are mentioning also in '26, but for the second half, we don't see improvement in our organic growth.\nRutger Relker: Perhaps on the GVT timeline.\nStephane Simonetta: We just discussed it.\nFrans den Houter: Yes, Stephane. There's just one more on the -- there's one more question.\nRutger Relker: Yes, it's Ruben Devos from Kepler Cheuvreux.\nRuben Devos: I just had three questions as well. I think -- I'm sorry, if I repeat a question that has already been answered, because I was a bit later to recall, but it rather revolves around your -- the margins, right? So I was thinking about the quantification of the moving parts. I think the 13% to 14% full year guidance, is that mostly operational deleverage from lower volumes? Or is there other factors like product mix or pricing pressure that we have to think about? Yes. And then I have a follow-up on that.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question. Let me just repeat the first half and then answering the -- in the first half, the margin drop is mainly linked to two key points, right, the lower volume in our industry and semicon. And that's what we expect also in the second half of the year, plus also, like Frans mentioned, higher extraordinary holding cost compared to last year. So mostly driven by lower volume impacting our organic growth in industry and semicon.\nRuben Devos: Okay. So the -- I guess, in H1, sort of the revenue decline was EUR 60 million. I think the EBITA decline was EUR 30 million, so let's say, 50% sort of drop through. I guess, is that I mean, typically, you had 25%, right, drop through, but that 50%, is that fair to assume that continues maybe 25%, but if an up cycle would happen?\nFrans den Houter: Yes. Yes. I think there are three elements. So first of all, indeed, if you look at the drop-through of the EBITA of EUR 32 million on the revenue of EUR 50 million, we first need to correct the holding elimination line item, that Stephane said. I think second, we lose EUR 11 million in semicon half year-on-half year, but there's also a decision to protect our capabilities. And Stephane explained in his introduction, yes, we also look at it in the long term and make sure we're ready for the upturn. A third element in comparing is that in industry segment, we have been continued operational excellence programs, where we expect also some further results in the second half. So that brings that percentage a bit more in perspective.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And then something related to semicon, I think you've said that the construction of the new location in Dronten is on track with equipment being installed and tested. Just curious, given the current market softness, how are you thinking about the pace of this ramp up? Will you align the pace of bringing this capacity online with the market recovery to protect margins? Or how should we think about that?\nStephane Simonetta: I can only confirm that the pace is fully aligned with our customers. We are working very closely. And again, it's about managing the balance between short term and long term. And the long term, the growth is still there. And the long term, this capacity is still needed. So it's fully aligned with our customer. That's what I can tell you now.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And then final question, just on the inventory reduction. I think you've already gone a long way now in H1, but what's the additional potential for further improvement in the second half and into '26, please?\nStephane Simonetta: I think, we are well on track. You're absolutely right. So first of all, we need to continue and sustain this level to be less than 90 days, and we are well on track also to deliver our '26 target shared earlier during the year to be at 85 days.\nFrans den Houter: And maybe it's good to give a bit of extra color, because indeed 10 days reduction and really good work by all our teams, it's also fair to add that we -- 2 days improvement is driven by the Paulo acquisition that typically brings a lot of revenue and not so much inventory. And also the ForEx exchange was helping us with 2 days. So I think 6 days of real progress, but you see, yes, some elements like ForEx, of course, an M&A impact are also to be considered. So also if we give guidance for the full year, please take that into consideration as well.\nRutger Relker: I'm happy to see that also we received quite a bit of questions also via our web. So I'll pick one, which I think is quite relevant. It's a question about the full year '26 EBITA margin, the target of 16%, whether that is still achievable.\nStephane Simonetta: Yes. I fully understand the question. Let me first repeat that our priority right now is to continue to take action to protect our margin for 2025. That's where all our team is focusing. And then regarding '26, we will get back in February to update our new target for 2026 based on the current market condition.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Stephane. I have another question also for Frans, about CapEx. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the CapEx towards 2030, as mentioned in the CMD?\nFrans den Houter: Very good. Good question. So let me repeat. For this year, we guide on a CapEx level of EUR 200 million to EUR 225 million. And it is based on the current portfolio. For next year, we expect a similar amount organically. So no M&A impact taken and after that, that level of CapEx will come down as we now have modeled, and it will be around EUR 200 million, say, '27 onwards. The number that has been mentioned in the Capital Markets Day, which is higher is -- yes, is a preliminary number based on also a very larger company. So we mentioned EUR 4.5 billion of revenue there with an active M&A agenda, there was an indicative CapEx number of EUR 250 million and EUR 300 million. I think that's 5 years from now and a lot of open questions, I would like to focus on the guidance on the current portfolio, which I hope we clarified this morning. Thanks for the question, that was a very important one.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Frans. There's another question coming in, and that's about the status of the divestments. You could give any color on the progress here, and how could divestments potentially also benefit your net debt or EBITA?\nStephane Simonetta: Great question. I think, I can only repeat what I've said that we are actively working on it. In our industry, and building segment, we hope to make first progress in the second half of the year, continue next year. The goal is still the same, EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million revenue. And the divestment we intend to do should help us to improve our net debt position and also improve our leverage ratio.\nRutger Relker: Very good. Thank you. Well, similar topic on the M&A. Do you expect, Stephane, also to do still more acquisitions in the second half of this year?\nStephane Simonetta: It's a great question. But first, we need to close our intended acquisition. That's priority #1. We need to close the great opportunity we have with GVT. Then we are still looking at potentially bolt-on acquisition, but the second half priority is clearly GVT.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. Very clear. There's another one on capital allocation, perhaps one for you, Frans. The EUR 75 million share buyback program is nearly completed. Do you intend to propose an additional share buyback program in the second half?\nFrans den Houter: No, I think share buyback is -- it's good to have a program this year, and I'm really happy with the capital allocation policy of Aalberts where this is a final consideration. So we always look at strength of the balance sheet. We invest in our business -- we look, of course, at M&A. And then, if it comes to shareholders, very committed to the 30% of net result dividends. And then just to rehearse a bit, how the sequencing is, when there's excess cash available we look at share buybacks. And that is a discussion we do after we close our books in discussion with our Supervisory Board in February.\nRutger Relker: Thank you very much. I think that we have had all the questions. Yes, I think we've managed to answer all of them. So as we conclude today's webcast, I would like to thank everybody. Also thanks, Frans, Stephane, for joining us today.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you. Enjoy your day. Bye.",

I'm happy to introduce to you our CEO, Stephane Simonetta, and our new CFO, Frans den Houter. Stephane will kick off the presentation, with some business highlights. This will be followed by Frans, who will give an update on our financial developments. Stephane will finish the presentation with an update on our strategy, and this will be followed by a Q&A session. Please note that today's webcast and the presentation will be made available later today on our website. Please let me introduce Stephane to kick off the presentation.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you, Rutger. Good morning, everyone. Let's start this presentation by giving you business highlights to tell you how was the first half and give you also an operational update for each of our segments before handing over to Frans about the financial development. And I would like to start with a few key messages to summarize the situation where we are. As you have seen this morning in our press release our first half performance has been impacted by the market headwinds and by the increased uncertainty due to the global trade policies. This has an impact into our organic growth and that's why as a key message of today, we are adjusting our full year outlook to reflect the market condition. But we continue to take action on what we can do to protect our EBITA margin, to optimize our free cash flow and we have made good progress on our strategy with three value-accretive acquisition that we will be sharing later today, two in the U.S., one intended in Southeast Asia for Semicon. At the same time, we are still actively looking at our divestment program to simplify our portfolio, especially within our building and industry segment. So in a nutshell, managing the short-term challenges due to the market uncertainty, but at the same time, continuing to deploy our long-term strategic actions. Now looking back at the first half, you can see on this slide, basically, now you see the key numbers that, again, will be explained in much more detail by Frans. So in a nutshell, the organic growth is basically the result of the end market headwinds. As you can see, we are reporting a 3.2% organic decline with actually a mixed picture between our three segments because, yes, in industry and semicon, we continue to see organic decline. Also, Q2 was a bit better for industry, but semicon continued to be very low. On the other hand, we still have growth in our building segment, we are reporting a moderate organic growth of 1.4%. As a consequence, our margin is basically the result of the organic growth challenges as we have a semicon margin going down following the volume drop. Our industry margin is still solid. Right? And building is stable compared to last year. But of course, we were expecting a bit better performance due to all the actions we are taking. On the other hand, I'm really pleased that, thanks to all the actions we are taking on pricing excellence and organic growth, we managed to sustain a good added value margins and super pleased also to report that we are improving our free cash flow. Thanks to the great work from our team to reduce inventories and also to manage our capital expenditure. As a consequence, due to the lower margin, our EBITA is down at EUR 1.38. So in a nutshell, as you can see at the bottom of the slide, good improvement in free cash flow and EBITA margin under pressure. Let me go now segment by segment. And I would like to start, as you can see here, by our building segment. In a nutshell, our building growth still positive 1.4%. And our EBITA is stable compared to last year, 12.9% compared to 13% last year. Let me now explain you, as you can see on the left of the slide, why our organic growth, you could say, is only 1.4% because actually, it's a mixed picture. On one hand, very good growth to continue in Americas, in Asia Pacific and in some of our product line, commercial valve, industrial valve, prefab solution, we are actually growing quite well. On the other hand, all this growth is offsetted by the challenge we see, especially in Germany and French market, but also in our connection systems in product line, which has been a bit lower than expected. And therefore, our organic growth is only 1.4%. The margin is stable, mostly because of all the action we took, but of course, we were expecting a better margin because all the actions we took are on track, cost out, inventory, footprint, innovation, and that's what we will continue to do to manage the short term uncertainty. So as a nutshell for building segment, good progress on our operational excellence initiatives and lower-than-expected organic growth, but still positive. If you go now to industry, a different picture. Still a solid performance, 16.8%. And as you can see, the second quarter better than the first quarter, especially because the organic growth is also better in the second quarter than in the first quarter. But overall, you can see it on the top left of the slide, it's a minus 5% organic growth. And we are doing very well, especially in aerospace, high growth in our defense, high growth in our power generation, very good growth. Also in APAC and Middle East. And unfortunately, this good growth are offsetted by the organic decline of the automotive market. And again, by the French and German industrial markets, which remains soft, and this is where we don't see improvement in the short term. On improvement, I think, we continue to take out all the cost out measure, footprint optimization, and that's why we sustain a solid EBITA, a bit lower than last year. That's what we will continue to do in the future. And to conclude, we're very pleased to report that our acquisition with Paulo is actually well on track. And we already see early signs of contribution in terms of growth and in terms of margin, so confirming the strategic rationale of this acquisition. So to summarize, industry, organic revenue growth, EBITA improved in the second quarter, solid performance. Thanks to all the cost out action we took. And the last segment, semicon. This is where we have the biggest challenge on the organic growth. You see we are reporting a first half at 13% decline revenue. This has an impact in our EBITA margin. And that's why our EBITA margin is down to 11.5%. But this is also where we are very careful in our cost-out action, because we have to manage the short term, but also we have to protect the long term. We don't want to be short of capacity when the market will recover. And we are fully aware that this industry is about long-term growth. And yes, short term, we are challenged, especially on our frame and module, in our machine conditioning. We believe now the inventory adjustment from our semicon customer is coming to an end. And now we are just exposed to the market trend in our semicon market. So what are we doing about it, managing the cost, like I said, still investing for the long term in terms of innovation. And of course, the key highlight, even if it's not finalized, is our intended acquisition with GVT to enter the semicon Southeast Asia market. And I'll come back into that because this is where we will improve and we will enter new area for the future growth of the company. So in a summary, for semicon, we continue to see lower demand, very careful about our Q2 and that's why our EBITA margin is under pressure. But I would say it's also about a choice to not go too low in terms of capability and capacity. And before I hand it over to Frans, I will just report also that we continue to make progress on our environmental performance. I'm really pleased that we sustain or percentage of revenue linked to the sustainability development goal with more than 70% of our revenue. And we continue to take action on our own footprint. And thanks to the work from our teams, we managed to reduce 8% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 intensity. So continue to be on track and made good progress in the first half of the year. That's what I wanted to report as a key business highlights. And now let me hand it over to our CFO, Frans, to share with you a more update about our financial development. Thank you. Frans?\nFrans den Houter: Thank you very much, Stephane and Rutger, and good to be with you here this morning and discuss the H1 results of Aalberts. But before I do that, I want to thank all the colleagues in Aalberts to give me such a truly warm welcome. I really enjoy being part of the organization, and I look forward to our Thrive 2030 journey. But before we do that, this morning, it's all about the first half year results. So let me dive into those, in this first slide, where you see four important KPIs that basically summarize where we have been working on and where we are in terms of financials. First, on revenue, we see a decline of EUR 62 million, which is organically EUR 50 million, and that translates into the minus 3.2% organic revenue decline, driven by -- explained by Stephane already, building, we still see a small growth. But yes, industry and semicon, clearly lose revenue growth. That translates into an EBITA margin of 13.5%. Yes, that's 1.5% below the previous 6 months of last year. Still a very good added value. As already mentioned, 63% in line with the previous year. And also the net profit of EUR 151 million, translating into EUR 1.38 per share. Of course, we have been working hard to protect our cash position, and I'm pretty pleased with the free cash flow. Also if you compare year-on-year, EUR 8 million up to a number of EUR 56 million. Yes, we lose money on EBITA because yes, that is the translation of the operational step back, but net working capital and CapEx both delivered EUR 18 million and as such, a nice free cash flow of EUR 56 million, and I'll come back to that in a bit more detail. On CapEx, EUR 100 million, we have been trying to rationalize our CapEx programs and phase them out adjusting to market circumstances. EUR 100 million, EUR 70 million improvement year-on-year. Also good to mention that for the full year, we expect CapEx to be at the level of EUR 200 million to EUR 225 million, which is also a bit lower than our earlier guidance. So first half year results impacted by challenging markets. And let's dive a little bit more deep into the year-on-year comparison. Here, we see the revenue coming down with the EUR 62 million already mentioned, EUR 23 million by acquisitions. We added SGP and Paolo to the portfolio. On the other side, we had the divestments of EPC company and then a small currency effect brings us basically to the EUR 50 million revenue decline. As already stated, predominantly driven by industries and semicon, which are in a more difficult period. And I think we'll summarize you at the bottom also driven by the pressure in automotive that is specifically hitting the industry segments. Next slide, we translate and we look at EBITA. Of course, in acquisitions and divestments, we see the same companies, but then the EBITA effect, small currency effect again, and that brings us to the organic decline in EBITA of EUR 35 million. Basically, three things. We lose EUR 11 million in semicon. We lose a similar amount in industry. And then there's the year-on-year effect of the holding elimination line item where we lose EUR 7 million. And I'll give you a bit more context there in two slides from here and give you a breakdown also comparing with last year. So organic decline, mainly driven by the drop-through of the lower revenue that you saw in the previous slide. As said, let's go to free cash flow. Here, we see in the first red bar, the cash -- the lower cash, because of the EBITA that was at the lower level. But then very clearly CapEx focus, rationalizing our programs and phasing them out EUR 18 million recovery in cash position. And then the net working capital also EUR 18 million, driven by lower inventories, which is hard work, driven by collecting receivables and then slightly offset by the payable position that was a bit lower. But also translation, I think, yes, of good quality of cash, that's been a hard work in inventory and collecting receivables to get this EUR 18 million in our cash position. This, I think, nicely summarized lower EBITA offset by lower CapEx and improved net working capital. On the next slide, it's a busy slide, but I think it summarizes really well year-on-year, what has been going on in the segments and the holding elimination. Let me talk you through. I think Stephane commented already, of course, in his intro. In building, you see summarized here, yes, the decline in revenue year-on-year, also because of the divestments, but organic growth of 1.4%, still positive, and I think good to see also the CapEx positions per segment, EUR 25 million, significantly lower than last year as we also try to rationalize CapEx and use the assets that we already have optimally. In industry, 4.9% revenue decline, but the revenue is still at the same level, of course, supported by the two nice acquisitions that we have added. And CapEx level, yes, similar to next year. And also because we are still finishing some greenfields and also the normal replacement CapEx. In semicon, yes, you see the revenue is a relatively big delta. So already explained by Stephane, we remain focused on the mid and the long run also supported by our acquisition that the intended acquisition that we announced but also visible in the CapEx where we keep investing in our footprint, because we really believe that the mid and the long run, this will be the place to be for us. Finally, as I said, holding eliminations. Important line item. Of course, the elimination line item is more an intercompany correction. Let's focus on the minus EUR 10.4 million that we see here, EUR 7 million down versus last year. It's EUR 7 million more cost. But I think, first of all, good to mention that last year, there was proceeds from an insurance claim included in here. So EUR 10.4 million reflects half of it is the normal holding cost that we have, EUR 10 million to EUR 15 million in total per year. So this is for the first 6 months, let's say, EUR 5 million. The other EUR 5 million come from the acquisition cost for the Paulo acquisition and we settled two small claims, and that brings us to EUR 10.4 million on this line item. Well, again, summarized at the bottom, building stable, industry resilience, and semicon clearly under pressure. Now this is a new slide where we review some key balance sheet items. I think it's really important to also have a good look at it, and I'll talk you through. On the left top, you see clearly that our debt position has gone up with EUR 220 million. That basically reflects the Paolo acquisition that we added to the portfolio, and it brings the leverage to a level of 1.6. Towards year-end, the intended acquisition, we hope to close before Christmas. And that, of course, will then increase the leverage ratio, but we will stay below 2, and we will stay comfortably below the leverage ratio ceiling of 2.5 that we always announced. On the right top, the equity and solvability, I think, in a good place, representing a solid company. And at the left bottom, yes, the ROCE is lower than last year, which is a setback. Of course, driven by the lower EBITA, but also in the other -- on the capital employed side, we also see the net debt effect that I just discussed increasing our capital employed. Net working capital, yes, also a translation of good progress already discussed there. We have made progress on inventories, which as Stephane will touch on in a bit more detail, we have been focusing on collecting the cash from our receivables and the payable position year-on-year has come down. So that offsets a little bit, but a nice improvement of our net working capital position. And that, I think, overall, gives a very strong balance sheet that will support the next steps in our Thrive 2030 journey, Stephane. And I think he will tell a bit more what we're doing there.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you, Frans. So you have seen that we continue to remain very disciplined on all our financial KPIs to manage whatever the market challenges. But while we manage the short term, at the same time, we continue to take action for the long term. And that's what I would like to report to you now, how we are doing, what progress did we do in the first half in our four strategic action as per Thrive 2030, as per our last Capital Markets Day in December. First of all, a quick reminder of the four strategic action. You can see from the left to the right, accelerating organic growth, optimizing and simplifying our portfolio, evolving our operating system and driving sustainable entrepreneurship. No change. These are still the action with the goal to refocus our company, rebalance our portfolio, and recharge our three segments. That has not changed. What progress did we do in the first half? You can see it here with a simple scorecard, and this is what we will be reporting to you every half year, every full year. So you can count us to show you the progress every time we are live and disclosing our results. Obviously, the first action, the status is not satisfactory with a negative organic growth in the first half. This has to be improved. But at the same time, we continue to invest in some specific organic growth initiative. We start to see the early sign of improvement. But obviously, it's still too soon to report progress. But I can tell you. So when you look at prefab solutions, when you look at our boiler room technology, when you look at our offering for data center, when you look at our U.S. growth ambition, you all will remember, our plan is still the same, to double our revenue in the U.S. over the next 5 years. Aerospace is doing very well, defense as well and also our semicon, which is all about innovation, system integration and design-to-value. More to come, but obviously, the first half results are behind. On the second action, this is where we are actually making good progress with two closed acquisitions, one intended acquisition. And as I said earlier, we still are working actively to make progress about divestments in our building and industry segments. The third one, the Aalberts way, it's all about the functional excellence, but where we did the biggest progress in the first half is on our operational excellence, footprint optimization, and I'll show you a bit more because we are quite pleased with the progress on our inventory days, reducing 10 days compared to last year. Well on track with our target to be less than 90 days this year and 85 days next year. And on sustainability commitment, also well on track, but let's not forget that also here, it's about investing in our people to ensure we have a future-proof workforce to enable our strategy. And as you can see, almost 400 of our leaders have been trained or went through our leadership development program that, of course, what we will continue to do as we cannot win without our people. Now one example, which I think, it's showing you and it's all not about the size because it's still a modest order book. It's still low revenue, but this is where we are investing. Just showing you an example of a prefab solution that we are doing in our factory with one example of what we ship and sold to data center in London, and we are doing that in Europe. We are also looking at expanding this offering also in other verticals like commercial buildings, and this is also an opportunity in the U.S. So you are talking here about a global vertical and our modular thinking where we can use many of the things we do at Aalberts. You see our expansion vessels, some of the valve, and we are very pleased with the progress, and we are investing in people, in footprint to be part of the growth because that's one of the growth driver for the coming years to come. You can see also in the summary, the three value-accretive acquisition and it's all about growth, it's a growth agenda, which also enable us to keep our leadership position, so obviously, aligned with our strategy. And you can see one closed acquisition for our industry segment with Paulo, in the U.S., one close acquisition in the middle -- on the right, sorry, with Geo-Flo for our building segment in the U.S., and in the middle, still an intend, based on what we announced for our semicon segment to enter Southeast Asia, and let me tell you a bit more about this great opportunity. Because indeed, you could say it's a transformative move for Aalberts. We are going to enter the semicon Southeast Asia market. This is going to open new growth area for us. And the way we do it is by having synergies, intending synergies between GVT and our Aalbert's advanced mechatronics solution. Why we are so excited about it? You are talking here about growth agenda, to support GVT customers and continue their expansion, where we will bring from Aalberts all our internal capability competencies. Second, we can also grow with our current customer and support the regional supply chain footprint development. So you are talking here about commercial growth, synergy, also cost synergy, footprint, commercial, we have many synergy identified. And that's why we still believe and we really plan to close this acquisition by end of the year, because it's going to support our organic growth and also supports our margin profile, as you can see here, synergy that will enhance our profitability and cash. So fantastic opportunity. Let's close it, and I look forward to report more once the acquisition is closed, but not for now. And on divestments, I'm sure you remember the slide from our CMD. And now just a reminder that we are still working on divesting potentially EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million, especially in our building and industry segments, and we hope to make progress in the second half, but that what we're working on at the moment. So based on the same criteria, ability to win and market attractiveness. The Aalberts way, this is where -- as you say, we are quite pleased with the progress. Our operations team did a fantastic job. Look at these numbers. And that's what I like when you talk about functional excellence. Its initiative that deliver results. And you can see now, right, footprint -- and footprint, we are on track with our optimization. But I think, due to the market uncertainty, it's all about scenario planning. We have a task force looking almost on a daily basis of the tariff impact. We have made progress on inventories, as I mentioned, EUR 110 million drop compared to last year, 10 days, EUR 10 million saving on operational productivity on the first half and 14% CapEx reduction going down to EUR 100 million. That's what we will continue to do, and that's why we are building what we call capabilities to invest in resource and to ensure we have a continuous improvement culture, so that we can repeat that year-over-year and not do that as a one-off. Good progress, outstanding work from our team. And on the decarbonization level, also no change. We are still working on our six levers, as per our strategy. And it's actually to achieve two key objectives. The first one is our own footprint, to continue to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission or intensity. Thanks to our energy-efficient programs, thanks to the usage of renewable energies and also to electrification. And the second goal is to help our customers to reach their sustainability targets through smart product design, through circular economy, and also through value chain collaboration. And I always like to say the sustainability agenda is good for the environment, but it's also good for our business and good for our growth agenda. So now you may wonder, based on the current headwind, what do we plan to do as a short term. We understand that the market uncertainty will continue. We understand that the market softness will continue for the second half. So we will continue to take the action that we took in the first half in order to protect our EBITA margin and improve our free cash flow. So continue to pursue organic growth initiatives, deployed the operational excellence program, as we announced last year. Further accelerate cost out, especially building segments and through operation productivity but also purchasing savings, new area, new opportunity, continued inventory reduction, continue with our CapEx reduction and we hope to make progress on divestments in the second half of the year. So overall, whatever are the market headwinds, we still have strong foundation. We have clear priorities, and the full leadership will be focused on execution, is focused on execution, and that's what we will do to manage the short-term challenges. Now as a conclusion, of course, let's go back to our outlook as we have released this morning in our press release. And you could say, based on the current market softness and market softness based on the uncertainty, looking forward, we don't expect an improvement. As you can see in the middle of the slide, we don't expect an organic revenue growth improvement in the second half of the year. Consequently, we are adjusting our full year outlook EBITA margin to 13% to 14%. And you can count on us to continue to take action to protect our EBITA margin, optimize our free cash flow. And while at the same time, we will continue to deploy and invest for the long term, deploying our strategic action as per Thrive 2030. Thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Frans. Thank you, Stephane, for the presentation.\nRutger Relker: [Operator Instructions] I would now like to give the word to Martijn den Drijver from ABN AMRO, ODDO for the first questions.\nMartijn P. den Drijver: Martijn den Drijver from ABN AMRO. I have three questions, one each for each division. I will do them one by one if you'll allow me. The Q2 was softer than in Q1 in terms of organic growth. Is that end market demand softening? Is that destocking? Can you tell us something about customer behavior and what you're seeing there? And in relation to that, you mentioned corrective action taken. Can you elaborate a little bit on what type of actions we're talking about. So that would be question one.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question, Martijn. And you are right that Q2 organic growth was a bit lower than the Q1, I think, especially in our building and semicon market. So semicon, it's basically the continued effect of the destocking for our customers. So seeing no major change. It was expected at least for us. And that's what we have seen in the first half. And the corrective action we took with semicon, as I say, finding the right balance, adjusting costs, but keeping the flexibility and the capacity for the long term. So I think that -- and that's also where we don't see improvement in the second half, so expect the same activity in semicon. On building, actually, you are right, the organic growth has been a bit lower than the first half. And we saw a market, I think, impact, especially in our connection system and in the German market. That's where the second quarter, so it's market driven, but softer than expected. And that's why the growth in the second half, I think, was only 1%, it's a bit lower. And if you look at industry, you have seen actually Q2 organic growth was better than the first quarter, right, from almost minus 7. We reported minus 2. So here, we saw improvement, still negative. So what we plan to do on the corrective action? I think, industry, it's all on track and because the footprint initiatives, the cost out, actually, we expect the benefit higher in the second half than in the first half. So that's why in the first half, almost 17%. I think it's still a solid performance. And in building, it's basically continuing. So the footprint benefit should also come in the second half. We just finished to close one major site at the end of the first semester. Then you continue to take operational productivity, so about flexing our cost in the factory. It's about direct labor, some variable overhead, fixed cost also, a lot of SG&A cost action taken in building, but also in the other segments. And it will not be for the second half, but we are taking a lot of action on purchasing that should help to have a better impact also in 2026, because we are just starting to launch a new initiative on purchasing and basically using the power of our segments across our business team to have more functional scale and also global scale.\nMartijn P. den Drijver: Okay. You've answered quite a number of questions. But to come back on semicon that, that would be my second question. My understanding, you correctly that previously, the statement was, we expect destocking to flush out during the summer. Meaning, more stabilized sales perhaps growing with the market. Are you now guiding for the same type of development in the second half? Is that the right way to think about it? Or do you still expect that flushing out to occur?\nStephane Simonetta: We don't expect improvement in terms of organic growth in the second half. That's our statement. We believe the destocking is coming to an end. That's what we see, but we don't see higher activity and higher requirements from our customers in terms of new equipment.\nMartijn P. den Drijver: Clear. And then the third question is on industry. In the second quarter, as you already pointed out, the EBITA margin was quite strong, 17.2%. You made some remarks about production footprint, operational action. Is that 17.2% sustainable, you think, in H2, given the top line developments?\nStephane Simonetta: As you know, we are not giving outlook by segment. But I can tell you that we expect the benefit in the second half of all the cost out action we took in the first half. On the other hand, we don't expect organic growth improvement in the second half based on the current market condition.\nRutger Relker: I'd like to give the word to Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen.\nChase Coughlan: I have a couple as well, and I'll take them one at a time, please. Maybe also starting off on semicon. Obviously, there's been quite a lot of talk in the market the last few weeks about maybe 2026 expectations for the space being a bit softer than initially anticipated. I'm curious also given the, let's say, the commissioning of your new plants, do you -- what are your expectations there internally? And do you think there's any risk of underutilization for that facility for the coming years?\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question. Let me first report that our new plant is still on track. We have actually equipment being installed and tested. So aligned -- also aligned with the need from our customers to have this new facility ready. And I would say, the market is quite dynamic. There are so many uncertainties that at the moment, we are really focusing on '25 and '26. It's too early to say. There may be growth, it may be stable. We will report when we have more visibility, [indiscernible], I think we can only report that we don't expect a recovery in the second half in '26, still a lot of uncertainty whether there will be growth or not in the semicon market.\nChase Coughlan: Okay. And my second question, going back to building and specifically in Germany, there was another building products player who reported recently, who actually spoke rather positively about Germany saying that there was some inflection in new dwellings and building permits. So I'm curious on where specifically you see so much weakness? Is this more from sort of the renovation side of things? Or if you could elaborate a little bit more on that German market from the building standpoint?\nStephane Simonetta: Yes, it's a -- you are right that we all expect better trend due to all new investments that are happening on the German industry. We just believe it's too soon to promise that second half will be much better. We are still doing well in our boiler room equipment, also in Germany, where we see the biggest pressure is in our connection system. So it's a specific product line. It's not all our product line, but that's what is making us only growth, like I mentioned, with 1% to 2% and a bit lower than what we were expected. So we are expected much higher organic growth. Now on this specific product line, this is where we see the biggest challenge.\nChase Coughlan: Okay. That's clear. And then my final question, I believe you booked a EUR 20 million release of provisions in the P&L in the first half. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on what that was? Or if I misunderstood something there?\nFrans den Houter: Yes, of course. Indeed, the release of provision of EUR 90 million comparing with EUR 2 million last year, and that EUR 90 million is related to restructuring costs that come out of the balance sheet.\nRutger Relker: Well, we have some more people in the queue. So I'd like to get the word to David Kerstens. David?\nDavid Kerstens: I also have three questions, please. I'll take them one by one. First of all, regarding the building segment, you're guiding for similar organic growth trends for the second half of the year. But I was wondering what will be the impact of copper price inflation and potential tariffs of 50% on copper, which should be accretive to top line growth line, but potentially dilutive to margins. What's your view on the impact here, please?\nStephane Simonetta: That's something we are actively working, and I think it's too soon to report if there will be an impact. I can tell you, we have been able to manage in the first half especially in the U.S., thanks to our pricing, all the impact on the tariff. And at the moment, we don't expect major impact based on what we know today, thanks to the latest development. So not something we expect to have a major impact, and that's why we are giving as an outlook, a similar trend for the second half.\nDavid Kerstens: Okay. And then my second question is related to the acquisition of GVT in semicon. I think in December, you highlighted that portfolio optimization, including M&A, should be accretive to margins and drive profitability towards at least 18% by 2030. But GVT seems to have relatively lower EBITA margins. I understand you have not quantified the synergy impact yet. But does it become more challenging in semicon to get to the 18% EBITA margin target by 2030, because of your acquisition strategy here?\nStephane Simonetta: I think, you're absolutely right that, what they have reported in '24, it's not at the level where we want to be in Aalberts. Let's see what they will report for '25. I think this is still within their end. But we are quite excited with the potential synergy that we see, as I mentioned, in terms of commercial synergy, cost synergy, footprint synergy. And we believe, together, we can make it accretive for margin, for organic growth, and for EPS, are still our long-term ambition. So really, it's about the synergy that we have identified during the due diligence process. So let us close the acquisition first and I really hope to be back next year to explain you a bit more in detail our plan to bring it to reach our long-term objective.\nDavid Kerstens: Okay. Great. And then my final question is on the unallocated cost of EUR 10 million in the first half of the year. Frans, you indicated EUR 5 million was related to acquisition costs for Paulo and settled claims, small claims in the first half. What will be the figure for the second half? Will you also have acquisition costs related to GVT in the second half that will get into the same number of around EUR 10 million, so a EUR 20 million number for the full year?\nFrans den Houter: Yes. Thanks. And I think an important one. Indeed, we will have acquisition costs of GVT expected to close this year. So then we will add that as well. That will be a higher number than then to one for Paulo. So the guidance would be that the second half will be a bit higher even than the first half in terms of the normal holding costs, which are between EUR 10 million and EUR 15 million per year. So the guidance would be based on what we now know, EUR 20 million to EUR 25 million for the line item for the full year.\nRutger Relker: It's time for the next person in the queue, which is Kristof Samoy from KBC.\nKristof Samoy: Yes, a few questions have already been answered, but I have two left. First on semicon. In the first quarter, you indicated that you would optimize the cost, but you didn't quantify it. Can you now give us a little bit more color on the exercise you have been doing there in terms of costs, saving potential, and the timing of when these costs and savings will kick in? That's the first one. And then on the recent transaction that you announced and that you hope to close by year-end. At the time of the announcement, 65% of shareholders approved with the transaction. Is there a scenario where you would go ahead with the acquisition, if you don't arrive at 100% of shares, meaning that you could end up in a situation of 80% of shares and a continued listing in Singapore?\nStephane Simonetta: Let me take the first question. And I'm sure you have noticed that actually our margin in the second quarter was a bit better than the first quarter already for semicon, right? Almost 10% versus 12%. So and the action we are taking is, first, to, of course, take out all the variable costs -- variable costs in our factories, in our operations. So that has been taken. We are also adjusting our SG&A to the level, is an absolute minimum, to not compromise the long term. That's basically what we have been doing. We're still trying to do a bit better also on the purchasing side. But that's why we said the 11.5%, 12% is actually, you could say, our choice even if it is not satisfactory compared to last year, but to find the right balance compared to the long-term growth also to be ready to do all the synergy work with the intent acquisition with GVT. That's the action we have been taking. So also in semicon, costs and SG&A has been taken up.\nFrans den Houter: Yes. And then your second question on GVT. And the answer is no. So we really want full control over the company. That's also where bid assumptions are based on, and we're confident that we have an attractive proposition. But that process is, of course, for GVT to comment on. Because it's a discussion between their management and their shareholders. But we're confident we have a good proposition for them. So let's wait the coming months, how that will work out.\nRutger Relker: Now I'd like to give the word to Christoph Greulich, Berenberg.\nChristoph Greulich: Also two from my side, please, if I may. And the first one is regarding the semicon business. I was wondering after the minus 13% organic growth that we've seen in H1, if you could roughly quantify how much of that is attributed to customers destocking compared to general underlying end market trends? And then I was wondering, implied in your guidance for the second half that we see a similar organic growth trend. If you look at the comp base, I mean, that gets a lot easier, especially in Q4. So if I take into account the easier comp base, does that actually mean that the situation is getting worse from here? Yes, that will be my first question. And then the second topic would be the GVT acquisition. If you could just remind me what is the timeline to reach or obtain the shareholder approval? And then, also in the press release, you are flagging an immediate EPS accretion. Yes, could you quantify that what are you expecting there in 2026 and taking into account the financial expenditure -- expenses for the investment?\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question. Let me take the first one on the semicon. So in the first half, most of it is coming from destocking that we have seen from all our customers. As you remember, it started in Q4, and that has been the major driver. We see lower demand. And that's what we don't see at the moment. Second half getting better. That's why we are adjusting our outlook. We don't see that it will be worse, but we don't see an improvement in the second half of the year. That's basically the reason for adjusting our outlook. When you talk about the GVT acquisition, I think the vote is expected in September. So that's why we also report that following the vote, we expect to close before end of the year. And you understand that before we talk about all the synergies and all the potential, like the previous question, our first priority is to close this acquisition, then we can be more open and transparent about all the synergies and action and opportunity we see following this acquisition.\nChristoph Greulich: Yes, that's very clear. And just maybe to confirm. So when you provided the guidance for H2 semicon, you took into account that the comp base is getting a lot easier in Q4.\nStephane Simonetta: We took all the latest outlook from all our customers because we have, of course, have a good collaboration with them, and that's what we believe is a realistic outlook. There are still opportunity like our customers are mentioning also in '26, but for the second half, we don't see improvement in our organic growth.\nRutger Relker: Perhaps on the GVT timeline.\nStephane Simonetta: We just discussed it.\nFrans den Houter: Yes, Stephane. There's just one more on the -- there's one more question.\nRutger Relker: Yes, it's Ruben Devos from Kepler Cheuvreux.\nRuben Devos: I just had three questions as well. I think -- I'm sorry, if I repeat a question that has already been answered, because I was a bit later to recall, but it rather revolves around your -- the margins, right? So I was thinking about the quantification of the moving parts. I think the 13% to 14% full year guidance, is that mostly operational deleverage from lower volumes? Or is there other factors like product mix or pricing pressure that we have to think about? Yes. And then I have a follow-up on that.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question. Let me just repeat the first half and then answering the -- in the first half, the margin drop is mainly linked to two key points, right, the lower volume in our industry and semicon. And that's what we expect also in the second half of the year, plus also, like Frans mentioned, higher extraordinary holding cost compared to last year. So mostly driven by lower volume impacting our organic growth in industry and semicon.\nRuben Devos: Okay. So the -- I guess, in H1, sort of the revenue decline was EUR 60 million. I think the EBITA decline was EUR 30 million, so let's say, 50% sort of drop through. I guess, is that I mean, typically, you had 25%, right, drop through, but that 50%, is that fair to assume that continues maybe 25%, but if an up cycle would happen?\nFrans den Houter: Yes. Yes. I think there are three elements. So first of all, indeed, if you look at the drop-through of the EBITA of EUR 32 million on the revenue of EUR 50 million, we first need to correct the holding elimination line item, that Stephane said. I think second, we lose EUR 11 million in semicon half year-on-half year, but there's also a decision to protect our capabilities. And Stephane explained in his introduction, yes, we also look at it in the long term and make sure we're ready for the upturn. A third element in comparing is that in industry segment, we have been continued operational excellence programs, where we expect also some further results in the second half. So that brings that percentage a bit more in perspective.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And then something related to semicon, I think you've said that the construction of the new location in Dronten is on track with equipment being installed and tested. Just curious, given the current market softness, how are you thinking about the pace of this ramp up? Will you align the pace of bringing this capacity online with the market recovery to protect margins? Or how should we think about that?\nStephane Simonetta: I can only confirm that the pace is fully aligned with our customers. We are working very closely. And again, it's about managing the balance between short term and long term. And the long term, the growth is still there. And the long term, this capacity is still needed. So it's fully aligned with our customer. That's what I can tell you now.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And then final question, just on the inventory reduction. I think you've already gone a long way now in H1, but what's the additional potential for further improvement in the second half and into '26, please?\nStephane Simonetta: I think, we are well on track. You're absolutely right. So first of all, we need to continue and sustain this level to be less than 90 days, and we are well on track also to deliver our '26 target shared earlier during the year to be at 85 days.\nFrans den Houter: And maybe it's good to give a bit of extra color, because indeed 10 days reduction and really good work by all our teams, it's also fair to add that we -- 2 days improvement is driven by the Paulo acquisition that typically brings a lot of revenue and not so much inventory. And also the ForEx exchange was helping us with 2 days. So I think 6 days of real progress, but you see, yes, some elements like ForEx, of course, an M&A impact are also to be considered. So also if we give guidance for the full year, please take that into consideration as well.\nRutger Relker: I'm happy to see that also we received quite a bit of questions also via our web. So I'll pick one, which I think is quite relevant. It's a question about the full year '26 EBITA margin, the target of 16%, whether that is still achievable.\nStephane Simonetta: Yes. I fully understand the question. Let me first repeat that our priority right now is to continue to take action to protect our margin for 2025. That's where all our team is focusing. And then regarding '26, we will get back in February to update our new target for 2026 based on the current market condition.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Stephane. I have another question also for Frans, about CapEx. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the CapEx towards 2030, as mentioned in the CMD?\nFrans den Houter: Very good. Good question. So let me repeat. For this year, we guide on a CapEx level of EUR 200 million to EUR 225 million. And it is based on the current portfolio. For next year, we expect a similar amount organically. So no M&A impact taken and after that, that level of CapEx will come down as we now have modeled, and it will be around EUR 200 million, say, '27 onwards. The number that has been mentioned in the Capital Markets Day, which is higher is -- yes, is a preliminary number based on also a very larger company. So we mentioned EUR 4.5 billion of revenue there with an active M&A agenda, there was an indicative CapEx number of EUR 250 million and EUR 300 million. I think that's 5 years from now and a lot of open questions, I would like to focus on the guidance on the current portfolio, which I hope we clarified this morning. Thanks for the question, that was a very important one.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Frans. There's another question coming in, and that's about the status of the divestments. You could give any color on the progress here, and how could divestments potentially also benefit your net debt or EBITA?\nStephane Simonetta: Great question. I think, I can only repeat what I've said that we are actively working on it. In our industry, and building segment, we hope to make first progress in the second half of the year, continue next year. The goal is still the same, EUR 400 million to EUR 500 million revenue. And the divestment we intend to do should help us to improve our net debt position and also improve our leverage ratio.\nRutger Relker: Very good. Thank you. Well, similar topic on the M&A. Do you expect, Stephane, also to do still more acquisitions in the second half of this year?\nStephane Simonetta: It's a great question. But first, we need to close our intended acquisition. That's priority #1. We need to close the great opportunity we have with GVT. Then we are still looking at potentially bolt-on acquisition, but the second half priority is clearly GVT.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. Very clear. There's another one on capital allocation, perhaps one for you, Frans. The EUR 75 million share buyback program is nearly completed. Do you intend to propose an additional share buyback program in the second half?\nFrans den Houter: No, I think share buyback is -- it's good to have a program this year, and I'm really happy with the capital allocation policy of Aalberts where this is a final consideration. So we always look at strength of the balance sheet. We invest in our business -- we look, of course, at M&A. And then, if it comes to shareholders, very committed to the 30% of net result dividends. And then just to rehearse a bit, how the sequencing is, when there's excess cash available we look at share buybacks. And that is a discussion we do after we close our books in discussion with our Supervisory Board in February.\nRutger Relker: Thank you very much. I think that we have had all the questions. Yes, I think we've managed to answer all of them. So as we conclude today's webcast, I would like to thank everybody. Also thanks, Frans, Stephane, for joining us today.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you. Enjoy your day. Bye.",

    "fullTranscript": "Rutger Relker: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. It is my pleasure to welcome you to Aalberts full year presentation for the year 2024, live in our headquarters in Utrecht. My name is Rutger Relker, Director, Investor Relations. This past year, we delivered again, a resilient performance, despite challenging end markets. We look forward to share with you today our progress made. Stephane will kick off the presentation with key highlights and an update on our operational developments. This will be followed by Arno, who will share our financial development, highlighting how our strategy has translated into a solid financial performance. Stephane will then give you an update on the strategic actions as shared last December during our Capital Markets Day. After the presentation, we will give you the opportunity to engage directly with us in the Q&A session. Your questions and feedback are very important to us, and we encourage you to participate. Later today, we will make both the presentation and the recording of this webcast available on the website. Please welcome Stephane Simonetta to begin our presentation.\nStephane Simonetta: Good morning, everyone. Let's start this webcast and show you first the key highlight of the year. 2024 has been a challenging year, but we are delivering a solid and resilient performance. First of all, we are reporting more than EUR 3.1 billion revenue. And due to all the macro headwinds and market headwinds, and also some uncertainty in the geopolitical situation, we are reporting a 3.4% organic decline. Thanks to the great work from all our team, we managed to improve our added value and are delivering a solid EBITA margin of 15% before exceptionals. We are continuing our journey, taking action to manage the short and the long-term, but also continuing to invest our CapEx to drive our business development plan, to drive growth and in 2024, we are reporting a CapEx of EUR 231 million and we are delivering another strong free cash flow of EUR 334 million. Our portfolio optimization, our investment in leadership position, as per our strategy to double our revenue in the U.S. is well on track. And I'm very pleased to report that, we announced 2 acquisitions in the U.S. for our industry segment, with the acquisition of SGP and the agreement reach with Paulo. We also did, as you know, one divestment for our building segment. We are delivering an EPS of EUR 3.12, and are sustaining a high dividend at EUR 1.13, same as last year. And as we inform all of you, in the last Capital Markets Day, we are starting a share buyback program of EUR 75 million. And obviously, we continue to take action on what we can do. And in 2024, we took some major accelerating operational excellence program in order to prepare for the future, in order to sustain a high margin and continue to improve our EBITA, basically addressing the short-term challenges. So overall, a solid year, despite challenging end market. And today is the first time we are now reporting and disclosing the performance with our 3 segments in building, in industry, and in semicon. The number you see on this slide is what we will be reporting and disclosing every quarter as per our new reporting frequency. And you will see that, there are different dynamics on this end market, in terms of top line and in terms of profitability, but I will start to give you an update on the operational development by segment. And then later, Arno will give you an update on the financial side, also by segment. So let's start with building. So with our building segment, it has been a mixed picture, but the good news is that Q4 has been the best quarter of the year. We are back to organic growth, with 2% organic growth in the last quarter. Also the full year is ending at minus 3%, and they are quite a mixed dynamics with our product line, with our end market, because we continue to grow in the U.S. We continue to grow in a APAC in Middle East and also U.K., good opportunity. And some of our product line are also winning share, thanks to the innovation, thanks to the business development, thanks to the investment we did in the future. And as you can see, our boiler room technology, our heat treatment solution, our valve also in the U.S. are doing quite well, and our groove technology grew in 2024. Obviously, when we report a total negative organic growth, if some are doing well, some are doing not so well. Even we believe many of our product lines, which are declining are actually doing a bit better than the market, but strong headwinds with the French and German markets, especially in the new construction in the new build, which has impacted mostly our connection system portfolio. As a consequence, our performance by segment has been challenging. Clearly, building is a segment where we have the biggest opportunity to improve our profitability, as we are only at 12.9%. But this is where also despite the market headwinds, we never compromise pricing. And also in building, we have improved added value. U.S. has been a major improvement. These are all the actions that we took to improve supply chain, delivery performance. This has paid off, and that's what we will continue to do. The innovation is also what allows us to have superior pricing power, and to deliver stronger financials. And that's exactly why we want to do also better innovation also in our connection system in order to do much better than the market. We continue to optimize our footprint in the building segment. We have announced a few factory closure, and we will continue to do that. But of course, most of the restructuring action, most of the operational excellence program we took have been especially in our building segment, to ensure we improve profitability in 2025. So first sign of recovery in Q4, and a lot of opportunity to improve our profitability, but also reduce inventories, and that's where we still have some work to do to better improve our days on hand, what we call our DIO. And this is, of course, in building where we have the biggest opportunity. In Industry, quite a different dynamics because the whole year has been quite negative. In Q4, we also saw the slowdown, especially in automotive, in machine build, in agriculture and French and German industrials -- have been really down. The good news is that, we continue to see very good growth on aerospace, on power generation, which is exactly aligned with our strategy to have within our Industry segment, more end market diversification and have a bit less exposure to automotive. But here, the good news is the performance. Our team has done a fantastic job to sustain high EBITA margin despite this organic growth decline, and this gives a lot of confidence for the future, because we will continue to optimize, to take action and to keep the strong EBITA performance in our industry segment. Continuing to invest business development, continuing to drive footprint optimization and continuing to add capacity locally always in the region for the region. As you know, this is most of it a service business and the customer proximity is what makes us win. And finally, on semicon, we are still growing as expected with mid-single digit. So aligned with our expectation, reporting full year 4.7% organic growth. But Q4, we saw major inventory adjustment from our customers. And as you see, Q4 has been minus 10%, especially with our frame and modules manufacturing that we are delivering to our customers. And so growth on some mechatronic technologies, growth in machine conditioning. We see also -- this is just the beginning, the potential of refurbishment, the repair and reuse with the new site we opened here in the Netherlands, but the frame and module has been the major challenge that has put the organic growth down for the full year. The profitability has been quite stable. We sustained more than 14% on semicon. Our capacity expansion are well on track. Actually, many of the footprint initiative should finish this year. We continue to invest in technology, because we want to be clearly a technology partner. We want to offer more system, more module to our customers. And we are trying to find the right balance, right, not compromising the short-term performance, but also sustaining capability, R&D power for the long-term. But we also are aware that we still have some operational excellence within our semicon to do better on quality, better on inventory and also potentially better on cost. So the outlook remains strong, and we will have to manage the short-term challenges in 2025. I'm very pleased also to report that in 2024, we continue to have more than 70% of our revenue linked to our sustainable development goals. We are closing the year with 71%, and on our Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emission, we have been able to reduce by 12% as the emission compared to last year. So making good progress aligned with our sustainable commitment. And the last point I want to say, in 2024, we have welcomed some new colleagues in the executive team, but we continue to have our operating model with myself and Arno being the Management Board, having now 5 CEOs, which are running our businesses, which are fully accountable for their performance, for their strategy, for their customer centricity, and of course, their growth agenda. And they are all now supported by 6 group function leaders, which will be there to act as strategic business partner, but also to drive functional excellence to drive synergies across our 3 segments. That's the new executive team that is going to deploy our new strategy and starting the third evolution phase of the company. That's what I wanted to share as a key highlight, but now let's go to the financial development. And I would like to welcome Arno to give you a financial update, and I will be back later on to talk about strategy in action. Arno?\nArno Monincx: Thank you, Stephane. Thank you.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you.\nArno Monincx: And also, of course, good morning, everybody in the webcast also from my side. Let me take you through the financial development of our business. Starting with Aalberts as a total, the revenue decreased organically with 3.4%. And as you all know, in October, year-to-date October, it was still 2.9%. So we really faced a slowdown in the last quarter, where the building business organically declined with 3% full year, industry 7.5% full year and semicon still grew 4.7% full year. EBITA margin, we could sustain at 15%, first of all, by a very strong added value performance again. We could even improve our added value with 1% versus last year. And that resulted in an EBITA of EUR 471 million, and a net profit before amortization of EUR 345 million. And these numbers are before exceptionals. I will come back later to that. Capital expenditure, we continue to invest in innovation, in expansion, in footprint, and our CapEx also increased towards EUR 231 million versus EUR 224 million last year. But again, we stayed within the benchmark of EUR 200 million to EUR 250 million as we have guided. Free cash flow, also free cash flow, a solid performance, EUR 334 million in 2024 versus a very strong EUR 423 million last year for reasons that we decreased our inventories in that year much stronger coming from a very high level in 2022. Nevertheless, our EBITDA reduced with EUR 42 million. Our net working capital move also decreased with EUR 36 million, and our increased CapEx cash out of EUR 22 million are the biggest movement factors elements in this free cash flow bridge. And again, we deliver 15% EBITA margin in challenging markets. The revenue bridge, we added EUR 3.7 million from our acquisition that we made in the last quarter last year, SGP. Then our divestments of '23, DISPTEK and '24 EPC, we lost EUR 75.2 million, because of these disposals. Then the currency translation impact amounted to EUR 8.1 million positive this year, mainly Polish zloty. And then last but not least, the organic decline of EUR 112 million is the 3.4% that we already gave to you, and that is totalized to the EUR 3.1 billion revenue in 2024. EBITA bridge coming from the 15.7% last year to the 15.0% this year or, let's say, 2024. We added from our acquisition in the fourth quarter, EUR 400,000 of EBITA. We lost, because of our disposals in '23 and '24, EUR 7 million of EBITA. The currency translation impact had EUR 800,000 positive impact in EBITA in 2024. And last, but not least, organically, we lost EUR 44.1 million of EBITA, and that is then summing up to the EUR 471.1 million for 2024, 15.0%. The EPS bridge coming from the EUR 3.38 million last year, Divestments lost EUR 0.06. Organically, the impact was EUR 0.37. And then you see that finance costs, yes, we could reduce finance costs with EUR 8.6 million last year, and that gave EUR 0.08 benefit in this EPS bridge. Also, tax rate was lower than the year 2023, also bringing EUR 0.05. And then last, but not least, the currency impact, EUR 0.04. Totalized to the EUR 3.12 for 2024. Then the revenue split for Aalberts in total still per end market. And you can see that, building end market in the 3 segments that we have now -- that we are now reporting, building industry, semicon, building is still the biggest with 51%, industry is 33% and semicon is 60%. And when we look at it per region, we see Europe with 72%, the biggest area, then America with 22% and APAC, Middle East, Africa with 6%. And now we give it per segment, the 3 segment report -- the new segment reporting, building, industry, semicon, we also give you the revenue split of these 3 segments. And there, we see Europe in building with 69%, America with 27%, APAC, Middle East, Africa, 4%. Then industry, it's also Europe approximately the same, 68%; America, 23%, a little bit smaller still; and APAC, Middle East, Africa, 9% -- and then last, but not least, semicon, where we do 88% still in Europe, America, 6%; and APAC, Middle East, Africa, 6% also. And that brings me to the segment reporting, where we see the revenue decline in building full year to EUR 1.603 billion, organically already explained 3%. But there, we see a better trend. After 3 quarters of organic decline, we saw the fourth quarter 2024 with a growth of 2%. So it looks like the trend has been broken. EBITA margin 12.9% versus 30.9% last year. So clearly, because of the organic decline, we also lost 1% of margin and still CapEx increased towards EUR 80 million of, of course, long-term projects that we were -- that we are still executing and which are now about to go down. So that means that for the next year, we will expect lower CapEx in building. Corrective actions are in place, of course, to improve the performance also going forward in our building segment. Industry, in industry, we saw a decline towards the EUR 1.061 billion in 2024, organically 7.5% minus. And when you compare that to 2023, it was still 8.9% plus, huge difference. And also in industry, it was actually the picture of the whole year. So every quarter was negative. And nevertheless, due to many improvements we made in the past already in our structural cost improvements, but also with all kinds of innovations, of course, good acquisition that we made, we could sustain our EBITA margin to 18.6% versus 18.9% in 2023. We believe that's a very solid performance of the team made. CapEx, a little bit lower, about EUR 100 million in 2024, but it's clear that, there is a very strong EBITA performance made by the team in industry despite organic decline. Then semicon, semicon, we still grew 4.7% organically full year. But there, the trend was after 3 quarters of growth, the fourth quarter was a decline. Nevertheless, 4.7% full year and EBITA margin slightly lower 14.2%. It is clear that the slowdown in the last quarter impacted also our EBITA margin. CapEx still ongoing, grew towards EUR 50.7 million in 2024 with a lot of big projects ongoing. So the EBITA margin was clearly challenged by a lower growth in the last quarter, actually a decline in the last quarter. Then the exceptional costs. The numbers I just presented are all our operational results, and these are exceptional costs that we did not take into these operational results. And actually, these are 3 elements. The first one you already know, we communicated in November, we have accelerated our operational excellence program. We took EUR 54.5 million as a one-off cost, and this program gives an annual benefit of approximately EUR 30 million, of which EUR 10 million has already been realized in 2024. The decision to leave Russia took a cost of EUR 37 million in our books. And then the outcome of an arbitral award, EUR 28.7 million relating to an M&A, and that is clearly was unexpected from our side. That is also the reason that we filed for an annulment for this award. Shareholder return over the last 10 years, like also Stephane already said, EUR 1.13 per share is our dividend proposal, which is stable versus last year. And that's also because we are confident being on the right track going forward. And for the first time in history, we also give and announced a share buyback program of EUR 75 million, starting from tomorrow with an end date of the 24th of October 2025. And this share buyback program will also contribute to the EPS going forward, because we will repurchase and also cancel these shares. It's an improved shareholder return in challenging market circumstances. The track record of Aalberts over the last 50 years, with especially year this year with our 50 years anniversary, which you can also see there that we are still profitable, growing, sustainable over the last 50 years, and it's a proven sustainable business model. And then, the shareholder value creation, where we present here to you the return on incremental capital employed of 90% over the last 10 years. We believe this is a very good KPI to see the return for the long-term of your capital allocation where everything is in, of course. And over the last 10 years, we did 90%. Earnings per share, over the last 10 years a CAGR of more than 8%. And in the dividend per share, we have realized a CAGR of more than 9% over the last 10 years. And then on top of that, also, we have now a share buyback program of EUR 75 million, which will start, as I said, from tomorrow. We are committed to create long-term shareholder value, and that is also what you can see in this overview. And then I would like to hand over again to Stephane.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you, Arno. Here you are. Very good. So time to show you also and explain you where we are in our strategy in action. As you know, in December, we released our new strategy, thrive 2030 to refocus Aalberts, rebalance our portfolio and recharge our 3 segments. Let me give you a short update. But first of all, to repeat the message, we have passed in December because we are now in execution mode. So still committed to reach our '26 target with a new also now also long-term horizon, and I'll show you later today, how we plan to reach some of the '26 objectives. When you look at the long-term, we are still well positioned for growth with 4 global tailwinds, which made our 3 segments very well positioned. And to continue to keep our leadership position in attractive end markets, we will continue to drive organic growth. I will show you some of the initiatives. But of course, we will also use M&A as an accelerator to strengthen our position. Today, we are going live with our new reporting segment. And of course, the Aalberts way will continue to be our winning formula. We are there starting the third evolution phase of the company, and our goal is still to unleash the full potential of the company. And as you know, our thrive 2030 is enabled by 4 strategic actions. And I'll go through each of the actions in a few moments. First of all, it's about having profitable growth with organic growth initiative, with innovation, with our business development, and also our ambition to double our revenue in the U.S. Second, our portfolio optimization in order to have leadership position, with our 3 priorities on acquisition and our divestment program. Third, the Aalberts way, continuing to invest in future-proof workforce, continue to invest in customer-centric supply chain and continue to drive functional excellence across our 3 segments. And the last one with our sustainable commitment in order to continue to make progress on all our environmental targets, but also health and safety and well-being for our employees. So let's start the first one, because despite all the challenges we have seen in building with the end market headwinds, we are focusing on what we can do. And what we can do is continue to push to innovate and to drive organic growth initiatives. And then you can see on the slide, it's about going beyond component, just not doing building components, but doing building technology, doing services, doing system and the skid system we are doing either for the data center, but also for supermarkets or also for some of the residential building, it looks very promising. You saw one example during our last CMD. This is where we are going to invest, and this is where we see growth opportunity in Europe, but also in the U.S., and we are making some specific initiatives focusing on data center solution, especially cooling solutions. Connectivity, I think in building, this is where we have the biggest growth, and this is where also we are working to offer more connected solution in order to have digital and have recurring revenue. And then the answer to the challenge we see on the market on connection system is innovation. And in connection system, we have a strong footprint. We have strong technology. We have strong brand, and this is where on our connection system, either with the cool press or with the smart press, we are going to launch and we are launching some great products, which will enable us to outperform the market and win back also some higher profitability. So a lot of exciting new products and new system and new solution in our building segment. For industry, the first one is really aerospace and power gen. We did our last Capital Markets Day in Eindhoven, and I can just tell you that, it continued to be very promising, more and more demand from our customers. We are adding capacity because we just see more demand in Europe and in the U.S. with our HIP vessel. This proved to be a very success formula, continuing to support our customers in their footprint expansion with the one we are doing in Hungary, and we have some also in North America to support our customer locally. Again, it's a customer proximity service businesses. Some very good niche innovation we are doing for the automotive with our hydrogen valve, fantastic innovation. And it's all about in industry, supporting our customers in their sustainability journey. And then one example, we just confirm our strategy is right to do acquisition in the U.S. the last acquisition we did in the U.S., it's proved to be right, and we see a fantastic organic growth opportunity with our thermal spray to support the U.S. customers. So that's what we will continue to do. And then in semicon, also different type of innovation because it's about systems, it's about integration, it's about module, and it's about reducing the supply chain complexity for our customers, so that we are also earlier involved in the development of the new generation either some of the lithography machine, but also some of the mechatronic technology. And the good news here is all the technologies we have, all the system, all the modules that we have for the semicon can also be applied to other end markets and verticals. Still a very small niche today, with our defense, but this could open a lot of new door in the future. That's something we are looking very closely also in our current strategy horizon. So technology acceleration, system integration for the long term, and we are well on track with our new state-of-the-art greenfield factory that we will be opening in the coming years to support the long-term growth from our customers. And on top of organic growth, I think innovation, that's really what will keep our differentiation, right? And just a few examples, you can see that on building, an example about connectivity to have digital offering with some heat water treatment solutions. Example with some of the integrated module we are doing in semicon to help our customers an example about solution or services we do in industry to help our customers in their decarbonization journey here being an example of a PFAS-free solution. The second action of our strategy is our portfolio optimization. As you know, in building, we have divested one company. In industry, we have announced 2 acquisitions in the U.S. and then we are still working very well on our funnel to add some strategic acquisition in order to strengthening our position, but always aligned with our 3 priorities in building being in the boiler room equipment and U.S. In semicon, with our portfolio expansion in Southeast Asia, and in industry, to have a more end market diversification and also to expand our presence in the U.S. So ability to win end market attractiveness in order to ensure a leadership position. The Aalberts way, again, that has to be our winning formula, our recipe, what makes us a unique company with our 3 segments. So having each segment, having each business team on one hand, fully accountable with a local proximity with a quick and speed decision-making. So we continue to win locally and end-to-end accountability. But at the same time, it's also having the global scale advantage, the functional excellence, and that's what we need to bring with our group function being the One Aalberts Company. On sustainability, no change, we are still deploying our net zero carbon roadmap. We have set ambitious goal for 2030 and '25 will be also the year where we will continue to make progress on SDG rate, on our CO2 emission, on Scope 1 and Scope 2, but also on Scope 3, especially on raw material and waste where we have the biggest contribution. And then talking about 2026, we wanted to share what is our road map, especially on EBITA. You could say challenge organic growth, fair challenge. But what we can do is to deliver and improve our margin. What we can do is also improve our working capital, and that is what we are focusing on. And you see here high level, how we will improve from 15% to 16% our EBITA ratio at Aalberts level. The first action is already in progress. Arno just mentioned to you, the EUR 50 million accelerated operational excellence program, especially for our building and industry segment. Then, of course, it's about organic growth. I just show you, some initiatives and this organic growth will generate higher EBITA. Then, we still have a lot to do, and this is where all our operational excellence, all the initiatives we are launching with continuous improvement, with inventory optimization, with the cost-out initiative is an improvement in building, because we kind of stay 12.9% EBITA. So we have, of course, higher ambition to improve our building segment. Purchasing also big opportunity, that's one of the group initiative to drive also functional excellence and have more synergy, and use the purchasing power of Aalberts altogether instead of having each company buying their own stuff. And then the last one, this is where, of course, we will always do the right things, right, because some of the portfolio, we need to turn them around internally. And some where we believe we are not the best owner; they will be on the list of the divestment. So that's in a nutshell, how we plan to move from 15% to more than 16% within the next 2 years, and you will see the progress in the coming quarter as we will be reporting every quarter our performance. So that's what I wanted to share to close 2024. You have seen the operational update. You have seen the financial update from Arno. Now, let's talk about the outlook for 2025. And the outlook is a mixed outlook, as you see on the next slide. First of all in building, in building, we see moderate organic growth. We see continued growth in the U.S., but we see also France and Germany still being very low. So a mixed picture with some positive, some challenging, but overall, we should see a growth as we saw in Q4. In industry, different picture, a bit similar with what we saw also last year, continued headwinds on automotive, on agriculture, on machine build and still low industrial activity in Germany and France, but also still very good growth on power generation, on aerospace and also on defense. And in semicon, we see also the destocking that will continue. We will continue on our end to continue to innovate, and we also expect some growth on the refurbishment. So when you take these 3 segments, some positive, some negative, Q1, we clearly see the same low activity in industry and semicon. We see positive growth in building, but as a totality at Aalberts, we are seeing for the first quarter of the year, a mid-digit organic growth revenue decline. For the full year, we see organic revenue flat, but with EBITA improvement, thanks to all the action we took because this is where we are focusing, where we can make an impact on the cost, on the optimization, on the free cash flow, on the inventory. And then we continue to deploy our organic growth initiative, but some of the headwinds we saw last year, we still see them coming in the rest of the year. So our CapEx will be quite stable. Actually, many of the greenfield projects, many of the new factory are going to finish this year. So it should be quite a stable year in terms of capital expenditure. And we will continue. We are not going to stop with what we have announced last year, always improving our cost out and our inventory optimization. So as a '25 outlook, we are seeing an organic revenue flat, but an improved EBITA margin. But this year is also a special year. 2025, Aalberts is going to celebrate its 50th anniversary. 50 years ago, in 1975, our founder, Jan Aalberts, started the company. And this is what we are going to celebrate with our employees, with many stakeholders around the summer period, 1975, 2025, 50 years of engineering mission-critical technology. And we will continue the great journey that brought us here, and we will continue to innovate in order to enable a clean, smart and responsible future. Thank you very much. So time to do the wrap-up. Before the Q&A, as a summary, strong resilience, strong performance despite challenging end markets. We took action to address the short-term challenges. We will continue to optimize our portfolio with acquisition, and we will continue to drive organic growth initiative. As a consequence with all our actions, we should do a better performance from a bottom line next year, and we are starting the full deployment of our Thrive 2000 strategy. In a nutshell, committed to return short, but also long-term value creation for all our stakeholders. Thank you.\nA - Rutger Relker: [Operator Instructions] I would now like to give the word to Martijn den Drijver from ABN AMRO for the first questions. I think, he's now out. So I'd like to give the word then to David Kerstens from Jefferies. Hello, David.\nOperator: Question comes from David Kerstens from Jefferies.\nRutger Relker: No, I think David connection. So then I would like to give the word to Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen.\nRutger Relker: Hello, Chase. Apparently, there's some technical issue.\nStephane Simonetta: Maybe start to read some of the questions we got, while waiting for people to connect.\nRutger Relker: That's a good idea. That's a good idea. Well, we have already some questions coming in. And the first question I'd like to address is about U.S. tariffs. How will you be affected by these tariffs, both directly and indirectly?\nStephane Simonetta: I think it's maybe a bit too soon to know, but -- if you talk about the U.S. tariff, we don't see them based on what we know today, being a major impact for Aalberts. Actually, it could be even more an opportunity, but I look forward to learn more and to see really what will be implemented because today, between what is said in the news and the reality, it's a bit challenging to know, but we don't expect major impact because we are already quite localized in the U.S. Our strategy has been always to be in the U.S. for the U.S. As you know, in our service business, we do everything in the U.S. In our building, we are factory in the U.S. And in semicon, we are not too much in the U.S. So no major impact for Aalberts at the moment.\nRutger Relker: Then we have some other questions. It's about semicon business. The question is that given that the big semicon equipment manufacturers expect some growth in '25 compared to '24, would you then still expect some growth for the semicon business for the full year despite a weak Q1?\nStephane Simonetta: I think it's a bit too soon to say, right? We have very strong collaboration with our customer, first of all. I think we are there to support them in good time, and when there is more challenging time. So I'm very pleased with the collaboration. Our customer has been very open with us, giving us the warning, giving us the visibility. So now, it's finding the right balance with them. We expect still a challenging first half, and we expect some recovery in the second half, but whether it's second half or it's a bit later, we are there for the long-term. We all know in this segment, it's not about the short term, right? So I think to be too soon to say, but definitely, first half, we still expect some continued destocking.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. Let's see whether the line is working again. And if not, then there are still some more questions popping in. Yes. There's a question about destocking. Can you perhaps quantify, what kind of reductions of inventories we could expect during '25 or '26? Perhaps that's a good question for you, Arno, about the further reduction of inventories.\nArno Monincx: Yes. But we also have written in our annual or let's say, in our press release is that we have an inventory reduction program also to further optimize that in the coming 2 years. And our objective is to reach the 85 days in 2026. So that's a clear objective also for us internally for all the teams to reach that. And it's also quite clear that, the most -- the biggest part of the improvement should come from the Building segment because there, we are too high, and there we need to improve.\nRutger Relker: And for '25, do you expect some improvement already?\nArno Monincx: I expect improvement, yes. But as you can imagine from the 94 days, which was clearly a little bit disappointing, where the slowdown of the fourth quarter did not help in the DIO, of course, but also there, we were a little bit disappointed about the progress that we made -- in some areas we made, but also, like I said, in the Building segment, we need to do better, and that is also where we will focus on, and we are already focusing on, of course, at this moment. So it will, for sure, go down.\nStephane Simonetta: Like Arno said, the inventory situation is not satisfactory. And that's why we are implementing all the operational excellence, the supply chain excellence, implementing all the tools in order to sustain high service level, but with a better mix through our value chain, managing raw materials, work in progress, finished goods. So we have started a few pilots in '24, which have delivered great results. We need now to roll out in the full company, especially in our Building segment.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. I get a message that, it should work again with the live questions. So, let's give it another try –\nStephane Simonetta: First click –\nRutger Relker: And let's give the word to David Kerstens.\nDavid Kerstens: I'm not sure, if you already asked my question because I also submitted via the webcast, but I had a couple. The first one was on how much visibility do you have on the expected organic growth recovery after the first quarter? And what are the key drivers? Do you expect Industry to recover? And how much destocking do you anticipate in semicon and how long will it take? I suspect you already answered that.\nStephane Simonetta: Yes.\nDavid Kerstens: The second question is, how do you feel about your M&A strategy to expand in the Americas in the light of the changing political environment with increasing protectionism? Does that impact the synergy realization of any M&A in the U.S.? And then I had one on the arbitral award. What is it exactly about? It seems a relatively large amount after a period with relatively limited M&A. And then maybe finally, just a housekeeping question. The M&A spent in the cash flow statement was only EUR 19 million. Just to confirm that it doesn't include the acquisition of Paulo yet. So it's only the acquisition of SGP. Those were the questions I had written down.\nStephane Simonetta: So, let me take the first one and then Arno the last 2. So you're right that we are watching very closely the -- like you said, the dynamic in the U.S., but we just see a confirmation that our strategy is right, right, to have more acquisition in the U.S. and to localize more because the growth is still higher, especially for our Building and Industry segment. Going forward, let's see. But of course, in a few years, we may have the question also about the Semicon footprint in the U.S. based on the long-term macroeconomic trend. So this could be an additional opportunity for us. It's not part of our strategy today. But for the long term, that's something we are looking at very carefully.\nArno Monincx: Yes. Let's say then the arbitral award, as I already said in my presentation, that was also for us a surprise, and we clearly disagree with that award. So that is also the reason that we filed for an annulment. I already mentioned, it is M&A related, but because it's arbitration, we cannot say more about that. And still, as you say, the case is still ongoing. So that's the reason. But at the end, we thought, it would be best to take this provision in our books. So that's what we did. And then the last one question you already answered yourself. I think the SGP is indeed the only acquisition we closed last year in the fourth quarter. So, Paulo is still not closed, and we expect that to happen in the second quarter of this year.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, David. Then I'd like to give the word to Alexander Virgo from Bank of America. No, I think he's not responding. So Martijn den Drijver from ABN AMRO is also in the queue.\nMartijn den Drijver: I'm terribly sorry for the other listeners, but I missed all of it. There was a technical problem, I guess. I'm going to ask my questions again. I'm terribly sorry for that. But coming back to building, according to my calculations, you had roughly 5% volume growth in November, December. You gave the number for Q4 as a whole, and you're basically guiding for that 2% in 2025. So my question is, was that very strong performance in the latter part of 2024 only restocking? Or is that low single-digit guidance, which you've basically given just on the conservative side, given that, yes, Germany and France are not doing great, but they're not going to deteriorate either, whereas the other European markets are actually recovering. So that would be question one.\nStephane Simonetta: Okay. Thank you. You are right, but we don't see yet, let's say, like that restocking. So the organic growth is really driven by modest recovery in terms of demand, but we have also a good geographical split as Q4 has been much better also in the U.S. compared to Europe. So that's, I think, what explains where we still have many growth opportunity in the U.S. We have improved our delivery performance. And in Europe, we have been very strong in some of the niche and innovation, and that we will continue to see. What will make, like you mentioned, us to be even better is what will happen on the new construction in the French and the Germany market, and that is difficult to see at the moment. So we still believe in our outlook to have a small growth as a totality between the good news and still the uncertainty on the market, especially on the new build and in West Europe.\nMartijn den Drijver: Got it. Then my second question is with regards to semicon. And it's clear that, that destocking hit you guys in Q4 and it's going to continue in Q1 2025. Can you talk about the phasing throughout the year for 2025 and perhaps also give your indications with regards to 2026? It used to be that you expect a double-digit organic growth for 2026. Is that still in the books? Or should we be a little bit more cautious given that destocking events going on today?\nStephane Simonetta: Again, let me first be very clear. The long-term Semicon industry remains strong. So it's just a short-term and timing issue. And I think now the good news is every quarter, we will be reporting. So I think, we will be telling you a bit more, early May when we publish our Q1 results. As of today, we can only tell you, what we wrote that we see a flat organic revenue growth, which still destocking in Q1. And yes, there could be some recovery in the second half of the year. But will it be in the second half or will it be in Q1? That's still to be seen. But long term, the expectation are still there to grow the business driven by all the new technology, driven by AI. So, we are part of it. So we follow, I think, the long-term growth with all our technology differentiation. And then, we will add our capability and our footprint in Asia to have even more growth and also have more diversified portfolio. So short-term, I think we'll report every quarter, but long-term, still a good outlook.\nMartijn den Drijver: I understand. Just one small follow-up. The company, Aalberts, has always indicated that there's little visibility in surface technology, so industry and little in building, but rather good visibility in semicon. What's changed now that you don't feel comfortable enough to talk about that phasing in future quarters?\nStephane Simonetta: We still have a good visibility. I think we -- the question is when our customer will start to ask for more and where they will stop in their destocking. So we still have the visibility. I think I mentioned before earlier, we have good collaboration, and we work hand in hand with them. So, I think that's not changed. We still have the good visibility. And that's why we are able to give, I think, a Q1 outlook and a full year outlook. And that's why we are also confirming the long term because we know there is still growth in the future. That's why we still continue to invest in the long term with our footprint, with our technology. So -- it's just a timing issue between what will be in '25, what will be in '26. I think that's still to come, but we still have the same visibility, long-term growth, short-term destocking.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. Clear. And then my final question is for Arno on the working capital and the inventory reduction. It did not materialize as perhaps some might have hoped for. Are you comfortable enough to talk about what you expect in terms of DIO, not an exact number, but perhaps a range? And can you perhaps shed a little bit more light, add more color on to what exactly you're going to do to get that DIO down?\nArno Monincx: You clearly missed it, Martijn, because I explained it earlier in this Q&A. Our clear objective is to reach the 85 days of DIO in 2026. That is what we work on. And we have been focusing also, of course, last year on inventory reduction. Now clearly, it did not materialize what we expected from it. But also there, it's -- the major improvement needs to come from the building segment. So that is also where the most actions are to improve. And we will continue to do so. And we are also confident with all the plans that we have now that we will realize this. Otherwise, we would not, of course, give this guidance also until 2026.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. And just one follow-up. Is that a linear process? Or is it more back-end loaded?\nStephane Simonetta: It will be a continuous improvement process.\nArno Monincx: Yes.\nStephane Simonetta: I think you will -- we will report this, I think, every semester. So you will see. But of course, it should not be only back-end loaded. We have to make improvement already this year because last year was not satisfactory. The good news is you see, the overall DIO of 94 days in 2024, but don't underestimate that the mix is quite different. So some of our product line in Building have been able to go down because they have been applying all the tools, all the supply chain excellence, all the operational excellence. Now, we need to roll out that to the low performer of the company. And as a consequence, our building segment should be much better.\nArno Monincx: Yes. And because of the fact that, we also now communicated in the press release, you can count on the accountability also in ours internally on this topic. So we will make this.\nRutger Relker: Okay. Thank you for this moment, Martijn. We have 2 more people in the queue. [Operator Instructions] Alex Virgo from Bank of America.\nAlex Virgo: I'm going to try and steer away from asking questions that have already been asked. I wondered, Arno, if you could just run through some of those exceptional items, EUR 120 million is a big number. I appreciate you've talked about the provision. But if you could just give a sense of what is driving those different moving parts? And is there a number we need to think about already for 2025? That's one question. I guess, if you could do that within the context of both EBIT and free cash because there are obviously adjustments in both instances, and they're not all the same. So I'd appreciate a little bit of clarification on that. And then a question for Stephane. I guess, the question really is, as we look at Q4 and down 10-ish in industry and semicon, and the guidance for Q1 of minus 5%. Obviously, flat for the full year does imply a decent amount of acceleration. I think you've been asked a question on visibility, but maybe it's less about visibility and more just about thinking what is it that surprised you about the weakness in Q4? And how do you think about managing that cadence as we go through 2025?\nArno Monincx: Okay. Let me start with the exceptional cost, maybe, EUR 120.5 million. It's indeed a big number. And it's also something, of course, we could not do differently, like the decision to leave Russia. It's a clear decision from our side that this is not the future for Aalberts to continue in this market. So that is what we did there, and that led to an impairment of our assets in the books. And the outcome of the arbitration award was also for us unexpected, and therefore, also we filed for an annulment. I cannot unfortunately say more about this one, because it's still under the arbitration tribunal. Last, but not least, the acceleration program. I think, yes, we were quite clear already in November that we would announce this, and that is what we did. And you can read also in the annual benefit, the recurring annual benefit of EUR 30 million versus an investment of EUR 54.8 million. That's quite a quite good program, and it will sustain our margin improvement going forward. And yes, we will continue to do so also in next year in 2025 to look for further improvement possibilities whenever we can. That has been the nature of our business over the last, yes, let's say, decade, I would say, and will also be the nature of our business going forward. We will always try to look for further improvements. And with a footprint like we have and with all the initiatives that we are doing also going forward to make the business more efficient and more lean I mean, there will always be possibilities. And timing is the natural cascador of this program. So we will continue to do so. I'm not so sure regarding cash, what your question was, because we are reporting, of course, our numbers before exceptionals so that you can still track our operating results in the right way, and that is also what we did this year. And maybe you have another question about it.\nAlex Virgo: I guess, it's just to make sure whether we think about modeling 2025, I appreciate the whole point of exceptionals are that they are exceptionals, but presumably, or it's an open question, maybe I'm presuming wrong. Are there things that we need to think about that would end up being in that -- in those lines for 2025 to make sure that, again, we're looking at the right numbers, comparable numbers year-on-year?\nArno Monincx: Let's say, the impairment is, of course, a noncash item of the Russian activity. So that is, I think, clear. The arbitrational award to be seen, I cannot say anything about it, but let's say, to be seen. And let's say, once we think it's time to make aware, if there's another program going forward for 2025, we will, of course, communicate that. But this program clearly brings a benefit of EUR 30 million annually, of which, by the way, EUR 10 million was already taken into the books in 2024. So, the incremental benefit should be around EUR 20 million with regard to this --\nAlex Virgo: Okay. And all the costs associated with that, you've now taken.\nArno Monincx: Yes.\nStephane Simonetta: Yes. And then I think on Q1, it's a -- we see a bit of continuation of what we saw in Q4. So continue to have a moderate organic growth in our building segment, and still low activity in our industry segment due to mostly, again, automotive, machine build and still low activity for our frame and module due to the destocking from our customers. So that's the visibility we have right now. That's why we are able to give this outlook for the group.\nRutger Relker: I now would like to give the word to Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen.\nChase Coughlan: I just have 2 questions regarding the 2025 guidance. Firstly, on the flat organic revenue guidance. I know, some peers in the U.S. have spoken to already increasing prices slightly in Q1 of this year, at least from the building side. I'm curious on -- could you comment on the sort of pricing volume dynamics that's baked into that 2025 guidance?\nArno Monincx: Yes. I think, we are more optimistic and never will we compromise on price. That's why even in the negative organic growth, we are being to sustain in building very strong added value, that's the Aalberts way. So we continue to push and we see opportunity on the pricing increase. Some already have been announced. So, we are well on track in 2025 also in the U.S.\nChase Coughlan: But then should we also -- by that means we should expect some slight volume declines if we expect organic flat in 2025? Or how should I read that?\nStephane Simonetta: I think, it's again, the geographical, you understand that U.S. will be better, both volume and pricing. Europe, some product line will also be better. But today, we still don't see recovery for many of our product lines in France, in Germany, in all the new build and in our connection systems. So as a sum, we see a flat, but you are right, U.S. should be much better. And then Europe will be still challenged, especially with –\nChase Coughlan: Okay. That's very clear.\nStephane Simonetta: And we are hopeful also, I forgot to mention about East Europe also. That could be also maybe not in Q1, but Q2 could be a bit better to have more growth. That's something we were also expecting last year, didn't materialize. So the point of time, the market need to recover also in East Europe.\nChase Coughlan: Okay. Great. And then maybe secondly, on the margin guidance, so the EBITA margin guidance expansion basically. Should we expect that most of that comes from the building segment given the sort of, let's say, growth expected there versus maybe a still very weak industry environment? Or how should we look at the divisional expectations for the margin in 2025?\nArno Monincx: That's a good assumption.\nStephane Simonetta: Obviously, you clearly see, right, in Industry, we need to sustain our performance, whatever is the organic growth. Semicon, we also need to sustain will be challenging. Q1 will be challenging due to the destocking, but this is not where we have the big opportunity, and this is not part of our strategy, right? So to reach the 16% in '25, most of the improvement are in our Building segment.\nRutger Relker: Martijn, you still had some questions. So I give Martijn den Drijver from ABN AMRO opportunity to ask some additional questions.\nMartijn den Drijver: Coming back to semicon. If you look at the growth you've had, the 4.7% organic growth and you look at the improvement in an absolute sense of EBITA, that doesn't reflect the normal targeted drop-down rate of 25%. The first question is, does that 25% rule or guidance still count? And secondly, is that due to the fact that, there's been a capacity expansion at IDE? You already have some OpEx investments for the expansion in the Frame business at Mogema. Is that an explanation why we don't see that normal operating leverage in semicon? That would be my first question.\nArno Monincx: Shall I answer this, Martijn?\nMartijn den Drijver: Go ahead.\nArno Monincx: You can now also see in the quarterly results that we made good growth performance over the last quarters, except for the last quarter where the growth of 10.8% in Q3 turned around to 10.4% decline in Q4. That's a big difference, of course. And you can imagine, when you're in the growth modus with this business that the drop-through is also normally able to realize. But with this decline and big difference in the last quarter, of course, that had clearly a negative effect in the EBITA margin. That's the answer I can give to you. We still are behind our objective to reach 25% drop-through on organic growth. So that remains an objective internally and also possible.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. And then my second question is, again, on industry. Despite that volume decline, margins have held up well. But at a certain point in time, the flexibilization of certain costs has an end to it. So what can you do from this point forward to maintain that profitable level, that high level of EBITA margin? And secondly, you talked at the first half year results about sales mix changes, positive sales mix changes, so higher level value-add services. Is that something that could drive -- could sustain or help you in terms of EBITA margins for industry?\nStephane Simonetta: Good question. I think, first of all, the footprint optimization is not finished. We still have many opportunities to optimize our footprint in our industry segment, right? Some of the operational excellence program and some of the EUR 55 million we have announced, it's all between building and industry and that will also generate results in '25. And we are already working on the next one. Hopefully, there will be even higher growth and the profitability will go higher. So we have still some footprint optimization within our Surface Tech. And as you know, in the CMD, even it's a Service business, but this is still today 60% of our business. And then where we produce components, what we call our industrial product, here, we still have the same operational excellence agenda to drive leaner, better machine utilization, direct labor productivity. So this is also on the, you could say, 30%, 40% of our industry segment, where we can use the same recipe as we are planning to use in our building segment. So that are the action. And that's what we can do whatever is organic growth.\nArno Monincx: And besides cost optimization, of course, the portfolio has clearly improved. And with the M&A we have done over the last, let's say, 5, 6 years, we clearly strengthened our -- let's say, high margin, high specification business also in the industry segment. And that is clearly helping to sustain these margins going forward.\nStephane Simonetta: It's a good point, because it's -- I'm sure you noticed in the portfolio optimization side with our strategy and action, where do we see the divestment part of our thrive 2030 is between our building and industry segment. So this is where we have also some portfolio or some businesses where we don't see us being the best owner for the future.\nMartijn den Drijver: Two more small questions. The question from my colleague from Bank of America on cash flow. The EUR 54.8 million restructuring charge, how much of that will lead to a cash out in 2025? Is that EUR 5 million, EUR 10 million? Or is it all already done?\nArno Monincx: If you give me some time to check that one second. Because I think --\nStephane Simonetta: Maybe you want to ask another question in the meantime?\nMartijn den Drijver: Yes, please. Yes, please. And my final question, it's actually another small question. The share buyback, EUR 75 million. I can -- would it be fair to say that you would prefer a steady share buyback policy that you would not prefer to go up and down, up and down, but that you would have a steady line? Or should we just think about it if you've done 2 or 3 Paulo's and it goes down? Or do you -- coming back to the first part, or would you like it to be pretty consistent level?\nStephane Simonetta: I think, I can only repeat what we say in the CMD. You remember with our capital allocation strategy, what we will prioritize. And I think we said, and Arno will add that we will do share buyback when we have excess cash available. So I think, we are committed to do it on a yearly basis. The amount will depend on what is cash available, because first, we fuel our strategy. We do our organic growth initiative. Then, we do our acquisition. We will continue to return solid and improve the dividend and do share buyback. The amount will depend every year, but we are committed to do it on the yearly basis. So, a steady program and the amount to be confirmed.\nArno Monincx: And your other question, Martijn, we made a specification of our operational excellence projects in the cost lines. And I can tell you that from the personnel part, approximately EUR 20 million still has to go into the cash and there may be some EUR 5 million or EUR 10 million other costs that are still going through the cash. The rest is noncash items.\nRutger Relker: And I'd like to give the word to Ruben Devos from Kepler Cheuvreux.\nRuben Devos: I just had the first one was a quick one just on electrification. I think you singled that out as a significant opportunity. Obviously, we had not a great 2024 in terms of EV penetration rates globally, specifically not in Europe. But for '25, things start to look better again. Just curious whether you could sort of quantify the opportunity for us or just give an indication what that electrification or automotive in general represents of total group sales today?\nStephane Simonetta: So electrification, first, you have 2 parts, right? You have the part in automotive and the rest. So in automotive, I can only confirm what we just said, right? We see the same headwinds as we saw in 2024, which is a global automotive industry and what our customers or what the OEM or the Tier 1 are asking to us. But on the long term, it remains a growth driver. For '25, I don't see major changes yet, but we still see it a growth driver for the long term in automotive, but in other industries. So electrification in other -- especially in Europe and to deliver the European green deal or to have, I think, a better opportunity for us. So that's still too soon to say, but no major change at the moment for '25.\nRuben Devos: Okay. Can you remind us what automotive represents in industry now with the new segment reporting?\nStephane Simonetta: Yes, roughly 40%, like we shared in the Capital Markets Day, so 40%, and that's –\nRuben Devos: Of industry?\nStephane Simonetta: Of industry, yes, of industry.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And then on semicon, just -- yes, obviously, this is a cyclical industry. We all know that, and I sort of agree that this will be likely transitory in nature. But just interested to hear whether you have some exposure to the aftermarket and service business in semicon as well, which is a bit countercyclical.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question. That's actually what we mean. Maybe we were not clear in the refurbishment. This is a service business. This is an aftermarket -- so we just opened a new site here in the Netherlands close to our customer in order to be able to refurbish any of their module and to give them a second life. That's what we mean, and that will be part of the aftermarket. And this is still small, but this is a growth initiative for us.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And then maybe somewhat of a conceptual question. Just thinking about the green agenda, right? I think, obviously, there's been a lot of policy changes globally. You see the elections in the U.S. We see how that sort of is translating into new policies in Europe. You've got evolving regulations, et cetera. I mean, just thinking about sort of the latest strategies or thoughts that some of your customers might have around energy efficiency, decarbonization, sustainable building materials. Like what has changed in your view maybe in the past 12 to 24 months? Are you seeing any aversion towards the green agenda? I mean, more than what it might have been 2 years ago? Or how do you think about that?\nStephane Simonetta: It's a good question. Let me say that first, in the U.S., no major change because the green agenda was never a growth driver, right? That was the activity, that was the consumption, that was the inflation, and that has not changed. So with more -- or with less green agenda in the U.S., no impact for us. Of course, we were hoping to have a greener agenda to accelerate even more the growth. But even without the green agenda, U.S. will be a growth agenda. So no major change. And in Europe, we still believe in it for the long-term because more people will continue to live in urban city and still so many old buildings that need to be renovated and still a lot of energy efficiency gain. And we are well positioned to support the energy transition in Europe. So we remain optimistic. I remain optimistic, because as European, we have to do a better job also to deliver the European green deal and Aalberts is super well positioned to deliver that. And let's not forget that on industry, we still see many of our customers asking us for lightweight solution, reducing also fuel consumption, which can help on the environment, but which is also a cost-saving opportunity for them. So no, I would say, no major change, but I really hope the European Union will still be pushing this agenda.\nArno Monincx: And don't forget that all these new systems where we are also providing our products that are also giving more comfort. So it's not only energy saving. It's also more comfort in the Building. So it goes together, and that's called innovation, right? So you have new technology which functional better performance, like with lightweight materials. Let's say, there's always a trend to do things better, lighter, faster. So that goes along with, of course, also, let's say, renewable thinking. So I think that is not a major concern.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Ruben. I think we have some questions still coming via the webcast. First is a question to Arno, and that's about CapEx for building, which has increased in '24 compared to '23 despite organic decline over the last 2 years. Could you comment a bit on that?\nArno Monincx: Of course, this is -- these are a lot of initiatives that we already started in the years before, which take longer than 1 year. So it's also the timing and the running out of startup programs. But we expect clearly that, CapEx will go down in the period ahead of us in building. But this is just the finalization of projects that have been started already some time ago. And it's all about optimization, footprint extension, optimization, a lot of good things when volumes will return in our factories, that will help to also improve our margin going forward.\nRutger Relker: So for CapEx, '24 was a peak?\nArno Monincx: Right, quite a peak moment, yes.\nStephane Simonetta: I think it's -- you should expect that -- first of all, we are still aligned with our EUR 200 million, EUR 250 million, but that was including a lot of green project factories, which are almost done. So of course, beyond '25, we should go back more to a normalized CapEx without all this greenfield. And now the goal is to use and have all the growth and have a massive asset utilization that will help also to improve EBITDA beyond 2026 and towards the 18% goal that we have in our thrive 2030.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Stephane and Arno. There's another question coming in, which is a bit technical about the gain on the disposal that we had, whether that has been included or not into the EBIT of this year.\nArno Monincx: It is included. So the capital gain we made this year, approximately EUR 9 million, that's including our holding eliminations. And let me repeat the philosophy about that. In our holding eliminations, we report extraordinary costs and extraordinary income that have nothing to do with the operations of our businesses. So the 3 segments are reported clean and all the exceptionals we take in the holding eliminations. In this year also, we had extraordinary income like the disposal, which was approximately EUR 9 million, but we also had extraordinary costs in our holding elimination, because the total holding eliminations is approximately EUR 1 million, let's say, less negative than 2023, where we had also this situation, and that is actually driven by the fact that the holding costs were a little bit lower than last year. So from extraordinary income and costs, we are about on the same level as in 2023. The exceptional program, right, the exceptional costs, the restructuring costs are not in the holding elimination line. These are reported outside the operating results.\nRutger Relker: Thank you for clarification, Arno. There's a question about divestments, whether you would expect the divestments to happen in '25 or only as per '26?\nStephane Simonetta: We will always do divestments. First, we have a clear strategy, a clear funnel, and it's all about timing, but it's not also about timing, it's having the right deal and the right offer. The good news is we are not under pressure to do the divestment. We will do it when we have the right deal, the right valuation, but also when we believe it is the right ownership for the business we want to divest. So it could be in '25, it could be in '26. Let's see. The only thing we can tell you, it is between building and industry. But some could be in '25.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. And then I see, I think at this moment, the last question from the webcast, and that's about innovation where innovation rate declined a little bit from 20% to 19% despite being a priority for Aalberts. Could you comment a bit on that perhaps?\nStephane Simonetta: A small decline, if you round up. So you could say, first, it's good because we sustain 19%, 20%. But for me, it's looking back, right? As you know, in the last 4 years revenue, which is coming from innovative. And you can imagine that in our portfolio, there is a huge diversity. Some of our product lines are doing very well, much higher than 20%. And I can tell you this is where we have also the better growth and the better margins. And some of our product line from innovation rate are very low. What a surprise that, this is also where we have the lowest margin. So that is why innovation is so fundamental for us. The good news is we have some successful story. So up to us to bring the one which are higher, sustain the one which are higher and continue as per our thrive 2000 strategy to be always more than 20% to keep our differentiation, right? And it could be some great products like I've shown in our organic growth, could be some solution, could be some system or it could be some digital offering.\nRutger Relker: Thank you very much. I still see one last question coming in. Yes. That's still on the CapEx. Whether you also expect still to have your CapEx range, EUR 200 million, EUR 250 million until '26 and only after '26 see an increase?\nArno Monincx: Yes, I think that is correct. So for 2025 and 2026, we see this range of EUR 200 million to EUR 250 million. And beyond 2026, we gave in the Capital Markets Day, let's say, the outlook until 2030 with yes, higher CapEx number, but don't forget the business is also growing. So our ambition is to go to EUR 4.5 billion in 2030. So the CapEx, let's say, percentage spend on revenue is even going down with this number.\nStephane Simonetta: The new range of CapEx, to be very clear, will only materialize if we are successful with all our acquisition. If you keep the current business as of today, the CapEx intensity will go down, thanks to our efficiencies, thanks to our improvement, thanks to all our measures. So we will spend more, hopefully, because that will mean we have done great acquisition that will strengthen our portfolio, with a higher growth and higher margins.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. Well, I think we've answered all questions coming in. So as we conclude today's webcast, I would like to thank each of you for your participation. We hope today's presentation has provided you with a clear understanding of our achievements, our financial health and confirmed our strategic direction going forward. Thank you once again for joining us today.",

It is my pleasure to welcome you to Aalberts full year presentation for the year 2024, live in our headquarters in Utrecht. My name is Rutger Relker, Director, Investor Relations. This past year, we delivered again, a resilient performance, despite challenging end markets. We look forward to share with you today our progress made. Stephane will kick off the presentation with key highlights and an update on our operational developments. This will be followed by Arno, who will share our financial development, highlighting how our strategy has translated into a solid financial performance. Stephane will then give you an update on the strategic actions as shared last December during our Capital Markets Day. After the presentation, we will give you the opportunity to engage directly with us in the Q&A session. Your questions and feedback are very important to us, and we encourage you to participate. Later today, we will make both the presentation and the recording of this webcast available on the website. Please welcome Stephane Simonetta to begin our presentation.\nStephane Simonetta: Good morning, everyone. Let's start this webcast and show you first the key highlight of the year. 2024 has been a challenging year, but we are delivering a solid and resilient performance. First of all, we are reporting more than EUR 3.1 billion revenue. And due to all the macro headwinds and market headwinds, and also some uncertainty in the geopolitical situation, we are reporting a 3.4% organic decline. Thanks to the great work from all our team, we managed to improve our added value and are delivering a solid EBITA margin of 15% before exceptionals. We are continuing our journey, taking action to manage the short and the long-term, but also continuing to invest our CapEx to drive our business development plan, to drive growth and in 2024, we are reporting a CapEx of EUR 231 million and we are delivering another strong free cash flow of EUR 334 million. Our portfolio optimization, our investment in leadership position, as per our strategy to double our revenue in the U.S. is well on track. And I'm very pleased to report that, we announced 2 acquisitions in the U.S. for our industry segment, with the acquisition of SGP and the agreement reach with Paulo. We also did, as you know, one divestment for our building segment. We are delivering an EPS of EUR 3.12, and are sustaining a high dividend at EUR 1.13, same as last year. And as we inform all of you, in the last Capital Markets Day, we are starting a share buyback program of EUR 75 million. And obviously, we continue to take action on what we can do. And in 2024, we took some major accelerating operational excellence program in order to prepare for the future, in order to sustain a high margin and continue to improve our EBITA, basically addressing the short-term challenges. So overall, a solid year, despite challenging end market. And today is the first time we are now reporting and disclosing the performance with our 3 segments in building, in industry, and in semicon. The number you see on this slide is what we will be reporting and disclosing every quarter as per our new reporting frequency. And you will see that, there are different dynamics on this end market, in terms of top line and in terms of profitability, but I will start to give you an update on the operational development by segment. And then later, Arno will give you an update on the financial side, also by segment. So let's start with building. So with our building segment, it has been a mixed picture, but the good news is that Q4 has been the best quarter of the year. We are back to organic growth, with 2% organic growth in the last quarter. Also the full year is ending at minus 3%, and they are quite a mixed dynamics with our product line, with our end market, because we continue to grow in the U.S. We continue to grow in a APAC in Middle East and also U.K., good opportunity. And some of our product line are also winning share, thanks to the innovation, thanks to the business development, thanks to the investment we did in the future. And as you can see, our boiler room technology, our heat treatment solution, our valve also in the U.S. are doing quite well, and our groove technology grew in 2024. Obviously, when we report a total negative organic growth, if some are doing well, some are doing not so well. Even we believe many of our product lines, which are declining are actually doing a bit better than the market, but strong headwinds with the French and German markets, especially in the new construction in the new build, which has impacted mostly our connection system portfolio. As a consequence, our performance by segment has been challenging. Clearly, building is a segment where we have the biggest opportunity to improve our profitability, as we are only at 12.9%. But this is where also despite the market headwinds, we never compromise pricing. And also in building, we have improved added value. U.S. has been a major improvement. These are all the actions that we took to improve supply chain, delivery performance. This has paid off, and that's what we will continue to do. The innovation is also what allows us to have superior pricing power, and to deliver stronger financials. And that's exactly why we want to do also better innovation also in our connection system in order to do much better than the market. We continue to optimize our footprint in the building segment. We have announced a few factory closure, and we will continue to do that. But of course, most of the restructuring action, most of the operational excellence program we took have been especially in our building segment, to ensure we improve profitability in 2025. So first sign of recovery in Q4, and a lot of opportunity to improve our profitability, but also reduce inventories, and that's where we still have some work to do to better improve our days on hand, what we call our DIO. And this is, of course, in building where we have the biggest opportunity. In Industry, quite a different dynamics because the whole year has been quite negative. In Q4, we also saw the slowdown, especially in automotive, in machine build, in agriculture and French and German industrials -- have been really down. The good news is that, we continue to see very good growth on aerospace, on power generation, which is exactly aligned with our strategy to have within our Industry segment, more end market diversification and have a bit less exposure to automotive. But here, the good news is the performance. Our team has done a fantastic job to sustain high EBITA margin despite this organic growth decline, and this gives a lot of confidence for the future, because we will continue to optimize, to take action and to keep the strong EBITA performance in our industry segment. Continuing to invest business development, continuing to drive footprint optimization and continuing to add capacity locally always in the region for the region. As you know, this is most of it a service business and the customer proximity is what makes us win. And finally, on semicon, we are still growing as expected with mid-single digit. So aligned with our expectation, reporting full year 4.7% organic growth. But Q4, we saw major inventory adjustment from our customers. And as you see, Q4 has been minus 10%, especially with our frame and modules manufacturing that we are delivering to our customers. And so growth on some mechatronic technologies, growth in machine conditioning. We see also -- this is just the beginning, the potential of refurbishment, the repair and reuse with the new site we opened here in the Netherlands, but the frame and module has been the major challenge that has put the organic growth down for the full year. The profitability has been quite stable. We sustained more than 14% on semicon. Our capacity expansion are well on track. Actually, many of the footprint initiative should finish this year. We continue to invest in technology, because we want to be clearly a technology partner. We want to offer more system, more module to our customers. And we are trying to find the right balance, right, not compromising the short-term performance, but also sustaining capability, R&D power for the long-term. But we also are aware that we still have some operational excellence within our semicon to do better on quality, better on inventory and also potentially better on cost. So the outlook remains strong, and we will have to manage the short-term challenges in 2025. I'm very pleased also to report that in 2024, we continue to have more than 70% of our revenue linked to our sustainable development goals. We are closing the year with 71%, and on our Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emission, we have been able to reduce by 12% as the emission compared to last year. So making good progress aligned with our sustainable commitment. And the last point I want to say, in 2024, we have welcomed some new colleagues in the executive team, but we continue to have our operating model with myself and Arno being the Management Board, having now 5 CEOs, which are running our businesses, which are fully accountable for their performance, for their strategy, for their customer centricity, and of course, their growth agenda. And they are all now supported by 6 group function leaders, which will be there to act as strategic business partner, but also to drive functional excellence to drive synergies across our 3 segments. That's the new executive team that is going to deploy our new strategy and starting the third evolution phase of the company. That's what I wanted to share as a key highlight, but now let's go to the financial development. And I would like to welcome Arno to give you a financial update, and I will be back later on to talk about strategy in action. Arno?\nArno Monincx: Thank you, Stephane. Thank you.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you.\nArno Monincx: And also, of course, good morning, everybody in the webcast also from my side. Let me take you through the financial development of our business. Starting with Aalberts as a total, the revenue decreased organically with 3.4%. And as you all know, in October, year-to-date October, it was still 2.9%. So we really faced a slowdown in the last quarter, where the building business organically declined with 3% full year, industry 7.5% full year and semicon still grew 4.7% full year. EBITA margin, we could sustain at 15%, first of all, by a very strong added value performance again. We could even improve our added value with 1% versus last year. And that resulted in an EBITA of EUR 471 million, and a net profit before amortization of EUR 345 million. And these numbers are before exceptionals. I will come back later to that. Capital expenditure, we continue to invest in innovation, in expansion, in footprint, and our CapEx also increased towards EUR 231 million versus EUR 224 million last year. But again, we stayed within the benchmark of EUR 200 million to EUR 250 million as we have guided. Free cash flow, also free cash flow, a solid performance, EUR 334 million in 2024 versus a very strong EUR 423 million last year for reasons that we decreased our inventories in that year much stronger coming from a very high level in 2022. Nevertheless, our EBITDA reduced with EUR 42 million. Our net working capital move also decreased with EUR 36 million, and our increased CapEx cash out of EUR 22 million are the biggest movement factors elements in this free cash flow bridge. And again, we deliver 15% EBITA margin in challenging markets. The revenue bridge, we added EUR 3.7 million from our acquisition that we made in the last quarter last year, SGP. Then our divestments of '23, DISPTEK and '24 EPC, we lost EUR 75.2 million, because of these disposals. Then the currency translation impact amounted to EUR 8.1 million positive this year, mainly Polish zloty. And then last but not least, the organic decline of EUR 112 million is the 3.4% that we already gave to you, and that is totalized to the EUR 3.1 billion revenue in 2024. EBITA bridge coming from the 15.7% last year to the 15.0% this year or, let's say, 2024. We added from our acquisition in the fourth quarter, EUR 400,000 of EBITA. We lost, because of our disposals in '23 and '24, EUR 7 million of EBITA. The currency translation impact had EUR 800,000 positive impact in EBITA in 2024. And last, but not least, organically, we lost EUR 44.1 million of EBITA, and that is then summing up to the EUR 471.1 million for 2024, 15.0%. The EPS bridge coming from the EUR 3.38 million last year, Divestments lost EUR 0.06. Organically, the impact was EUR 0.37. And then you see that finance costs, yes, we could reduce finance costs with EUR 8.6 million last year, and that gave EUR 0.08 benefit in this EPS bridge. Also, tax rate was lower than the year 2023, also bringing EUR 0.05. And then last, but not least, the currency impact, EUR 0.04. Totalized to the EUR 3.12 for 2024. Then the revenue split for Aalberts in total still per end market. And you can see that, building end market in the 3 segments that we have now -- that we are now reporting, building industry, semicon, building is still the biggest with 51%, industry is 33% and semicon is 60%. And when we look at it per region, we see Europe with 72%, the biggest area, then America with 22% and APAC, Middle East, Africa with 6%. And now we give it per segment, the 3 segment report -- the new segment reporting, building, industry, semicon, we also give you the revenue split of these 3 segments. And there, we see Europe in building with 69%, America with 27%, APAC, Middle East, Africa, 4%. Then industry, it's also Europe approximately the same, 68%; America, 23%, a little bit smaller still; and APAC, Middle East, Africa, 9% -- and then last, but not least, semicon, where we do 88% still in Europe, America, 6%; and APAC, Middle East, Africa, 6% also. And that brings me to the segment reporting, where we see the revenue decline in building full year to EUR 1.603 billion, organically already explained 3%. But there, we see a better trend. After 3 quarters of organic decline, we saw the fourth quarter 2024 with a growth of 2%. So it looks like the trend has been broken. EBITA margin 12.9% versus 30.9% last year. So clearly, because of the organic decline, we also lost 1% of margin and still CapEx increased towards EUR 80 million of, of course, long-term projects that we were -- that we are still executing and which are now about to go down. So that means that for the next year, we will expect lower CapEx in building. Corrective actions are in place, of course, to improve the performance also going forward in our building segment. Industry, in industry, we saw a decline towards the EUR 1.061 billion in 2024, organically 7.5% minus. And when you compare that to 2023, it was still 8.9% plus, huge difference. And also in industry, it was actually the picture of the whole year. So every quarter was negative. And nevertheless, due to many improvements we made in the past already in our structural cost improvements, but also with all kinds of innovations, of course, good acquisition that we made, we could sustain our EBITA margin to 18.6% versus 18.9% in 2023. We believe that's a very solid performance of the team made. CapEx, a little bit lower, about EUR 100 million in 2024, but it's clear that, there is a very strong EBITA performance made by the team in industry despite organic decline. Then semicon, semicon, we still grew 4.7% organically full year. But there, the trend was after 3 quarters of growth, the fourth quarter was a decline. Nevertheless, 4.7% full year and EBITA margin slightly lower 14.2%. It is clear that the slowdown in the last quarter impacted also our EBITA margin. CapEx still ongoing, grew towards EUR 50.7 million in 2024 with a lot of big projects ongoing. So the EBITA margin was clearly challenged by a lower growth in the last quarter, actually a decline in the last quarter. Then the exceptional costs. The numbers I just presented are all our operational results, and these are exceptional costs that we did not take into these operational results. And actually, these are 3 elements. The first one you already know, we communicated in November, we have accelerated our operational excellence program. We took EUR 54.5 million as a one-off cost, and this program gives an annual benefit of approximately EUR 30 million, of which EUR 10 million has already been realized in 2024. The decision to leave Russia took a cost of EUR 37 million in our books. And then the outcome of an arbitral award, EUR 28.7 million relating to an M&A, and that is clearly was unexpected from our side. That is also the reason that we filed for an annulment for this award. Shareholder return over the last 10 years, like also Stephane already said, EUR 1.13 per share is our dividend proposal, which is stable versus last year. And that's also because we are confident being on the right track going forward. And for the first time in history, we also give and announced a share buyback program of EUR 75 million, starting from tomorrow with an end date of the 24th of October 2025. And this share buyback program will also contribute to the EPS going forward, because we will repurchase and also cancel these shares. It's an improved shareholder return in challenging market circumstances. The track record of Aalberts over the last 50 years, with especially year this year with our 50 years anniversary, which you can also see there that we are still profitable, growing, sustainable over the last 50 years, and it's a proven sustainable business model. And then, the shareholder value creation, where we present here to you the return on incremental capital employed of 90% over the last 10 years. We believe this is a very good KPI to see the return for the long-term of your capital allocation where everything is in, of course. And over the last 10 years, we did 90%. Earnings per share, over the last 10 years a CAGR of more than 8%. And in the dividend per share, we have realized a CAGR of more than 9% over the last 10 years. And then on top of that, also, we have now a share buyback program of EUR 75 million, which will start, as I said, from tomorrow. We are committed to create long-term shareholder value, and that is also what you can see in this overview. And then I would like to hand over again to Stephane.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you, Arno. Here you are. Very good. So time to show you also and explain you where we are in our strategy in action. As you know, in December, we released our new strategy, thrive 2030 to refocus Aalberts, rebalance our portfolio and recharge our 3 segments. Let me give you a short update. But first of all, to repeat the message, we have passed in December because we are now in execution mode. So still committed to reach our '26 target with a new also now also long-term horizon, and I'll show you later today, how we plan to reach some of the '26 objectives. When you look at the long-term, we are still well positioned for growth with 4 global tailwinds, which made our 3 segments very well positioned. And to continue to keep our leadership position in attractive end markets, we will continue to drive organic growth. I will show you some of the initiatives. But of course, we will also use M&A as an accelerator to strengthen our position. Today, we are going live with our new reporting segment. And of course, the Aalberts way will continue to be our winning formula. We are there starting the third evolution phase of the company, and our goal is still to unleash the full potential of the company. And as you know, our thrive 2030 is enabled by 4 strategic actions. And I'll go through each of the actions in a few moments. First of all, it's about having profitable growth with organic growth initiative, with innovation, with our business development, and also our ambition to double our revenue in the U.S. Second, our portfolio optimization in order to have leadership position, with our 3 priorities on acquisition and our divestment program. Third, the Aalberts way, continuing to invest in future-proof workforce, continue to invest in customer-centric supply chain and continue to drive functional excellence across our 3 segments. And the last one with our sustainable commitment in order to continue to make progress on all our environmental targets, but also health and safety and well-being for our employees. So let's start the first one, because despite all the challenges we have seen in building with the end market headwinds, we are focusing on what we can do. And what we can do is continue to push to innovate and to drive organic growth initiatives. And then you can see on the slide, it's about going beyond component, just not doing building components, but doing building technology, doing services, doing system and the skid system we are doing either for the data center, but also for supermarkets or also for some of the residential building, it looks very promising. You saw one example during our last CMD. This is where we are going to invest, and this is where we see growth opportunity in Europe, but also in the U.S., and we are making some specific initiatives focusing on data center solution, especially cooling solutions. Connectivity, I think in building, this is where we have the biggest growth, and this is where also we are working to offer more connected solution in order to have digital and have recurring revenue. And then the answer to the challenge we see on the market on connection system is innovation. And in connection system, we have a strong footprint. We have strong technology. We have strong brand, and this is where on our connection system, either with the cool press or with the smart press, we are going to launch and we are launching some great products, which will enable us to outperform the market and win back also some higher profitability. So a lot of exciting new products and new system and new solution in our building segment. For industry, the first one is really aerospace and power gen. We did our last Capital Markets Day in Eindhoven, and I can just tell you that, it continued to be very promising, more and more demand from our customers. We are adding capacity because we just see more demand in Europe and in the U.S. with our HIP vessel. This proved to be a very success formula, continuing to support our customers in their footprint expansion with the one we are doing in Hungary, and we have some also in North America to support our customer locally. Again, it's a customer proximity service businesses. Some very good niche innovation we are doing for the automotive with our hydrogen valve, fantastic innovation. And it's all about in industry, supporting our customers in their sustainability journey. And then one example, we just confirm our strategy is right to do acquisition in the U.S. the last acquisition we did in the U.S., it's proved to be right, and we see a fantastic organic growth opportunity with our thermal spray to support the U.S. customers. So that's what we will continue to do. And then in semicon, also different type of innovation because it's about systems, it's about integration, it's about module, and it's about reducing the supply chain complexity for our customers, so that we are also earlier involved in the development of the new generation either some of the lithography machine, but also some of the mechatronic technology. And the good news here is all the technologies we have, all the system, all the modules that we have for the semicon can also be applied to other end markets and verticals. Still a very small niche today, with our defense, but this could open a lot of new door in the future. That's something we are looking very closely also in our current strategy horizon. So technology acceleration, system integration for the long term, and we are well on track with our new state-of-the-art greenfield factory that we will be opening in the coming years to support the long-term growth from our customers. And on top of organic growth, I think innovation, that's really what will keep our differentiation, right? And just a few examples, you can see that on building, an example about connectivity to have digital offering with some heat water treatment solutions. Example with some of the integrated module we are doing in semicon to help our customers an example about solution or services we do in industry to help our customers in their decarbonization journey here being an example of a PFAS-free solution. The second action of our strategy is our portfolio optimization. As you know, in building, we have divested one company. In industry, we have announced 2 acquisitions in the U.S. and then we are still working very well on our funnel to add some strategic acquisition in order to strengthening our position, but always aligned with our 3 priorities in building being in the boiler room equipment and U.S. In semicon, with our portfolio expansion in Southeast Asia, and in industry, to have a more end market diversification and also to expand our presence in the U.S. So ability to win end market attractiveness in order to ensure a leadership position. The Aalberts way, again, that has to be our winning formula, our recipe, what makes us a unique company with our 3 segments. So having each segment, having each business team on one hand, fully accountable with a local proximity with a quick and speed decision-making. So we continue to win locally and end-to-end accountability. But at the same time, it's also having the global scale advantage, the functional excellence, and that's what we need to bring with our group function being the One Aalberts Company. On sustainability, no change, we are still deploying our net zero carbon roadmap. We have set ambitious goal for 2030 and '25 will be also the year where we will continue to make progress on SDG rate, on our CO2 emission, on Scope 1 and Scope 2, but also on Scope 3, especially on raw material and waste where we have the biggest contribution. And then talking about 2026, we wanted to share what is our road map, especially on EBITA. You could say challenge organic growth, fair challenge. But what we can do is to deliver and improve our margin. What we can do is also improve our working capital, and that is what we are focusing on. And you see here high level, how we will improve from 15% to 16% our EBITA ratio at Aalberts level. The first action is already in progress. Arno just mentioned to you, the EUR 50 million accelerated operational excellence program, especially for our building and industry segment. Then, of course, it's about organic growth. I just show you, some initiatives and this organic growth will generate higher EBITA. Then, we still have a lot to do, and this is where all our operational excellence, all the initiatives we are launching with continuous improvement, with inventory optimization, with the cost-out initiative is an improvement in building, because we kind of stay 12.9% EBITA. So we have, of course, higher ambition to improve our building segment. Purchasing also big opportunity, that's one of the group initiative to drive also functional excellence and have more synergy, and use the purchasing power of Aalberts altogether instead of having each company buying their own stuff. And then the last one, this is where, of course, we will always do the right things, right, because some of the portfolio, we need to turn them around internally. And some where we believe we are not the best owner; they will be on the list of the divestment. So that's in a nutshell, how we plan to move from 15% to more than 16% within the next 2 years, and you will see the progress in the coming quarter as we will be reporting every quarter our performance. So that's what I wanted to share to close 2024. You have seen the operational update. You have seen the financial update from Arno. Now, let's talk about the outlook for 2025. And the outlook is a mixed outlook, as you see on the next slide. First of all in building, in building, we see moderate organic growth. We see continued growth in the U.S., but we see also France and Germany still being very low. So a mixed picture with some positive, some challenging, but overall, we should see a growth as we saw in Q4. In industry, different picture, a bit similar with what we saw also last year, continued headwinds on automotive, on agriculture, on machine build and still low industrial activity in Germany and France, but also still very good growth on power generation, on aerospace and also on defense. And in semicon, we see also the destocking that will continue. We will continue on our end to continue to innovate, and we also expect some growth on the refurbishment. So when you take these 3 segments, some positive, some negative, Q1, we clearly see the same low activity in industry and semicon. We see positive growth in building, but as a totality at Aalberts, we are seeing for the first quarter of the year, a mid-digit organic growth revenue decline. For the full year, we see organic revenue flat, but with EBITA improvement, thanks to all the action we took because this is where we are focusing, where we can make an impact on the cost, on the optimization, on the free cash flow, on the inventory. And then we continue to deploy our organic growth initiative, but some of the headwinds we saw last year, we still see them coming in the rest of the year. So our CapEx will be quite stable. Actually, many of the greenfield projects, many of the new factory are going to finish this year. So it should be quite a stable year in terms of capital expenditure. And we will continue. We are not going to stop with what we have announced last year, always improving our cost out and our inventory optimization. So as a '25 outlook, we are seeing an organic revenue flat, but an improved EBITA margin. But this year is also a special year. 2025, Aalberts is going to celebrate its 50th anniversary. 50 years ago, in 1975, our founder, Jan Aalberts, started the company. And this is what we are going to celebrate with our employees, with many stakeholders around the summer period, 1975, 2025, 50 years of engineering mission-critical technology. And we will continue the great journey that brought us here, and we will continue to innovate in order to enable a clean, smart and responsible future. Thank you very much. So time to do the wrap-up. Before the Q&A, as a summary, strong resilience, strong performance despite challenging end markets. We took action to address the short-term challenges. We will continue to optimize our portfolio with acquisition, and we will continue to drive organic growth initiative. As a consequence with all our actions, we should do a better performance from a bottom line next year, and we are starting the full deployment of our Thrive 2000 strategy. In a nutshell, committed to return short, but also long-term value creation for all our stakeholders. Thank you.\nA - Rutger Relker: [Operator Instructions] I would now like to give the word to Martijn den Drijver from ABN AMRO for the first questions. I think, he's now out. So I'd like to give the word then to David Kerstens from Jefferies. Hello, David.\nOperator: Question comes from David Kerstens from Jefferies.\nRutger Relker: No, I think David connection. So then I would like to give the word to Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen.\nRutger Relker: Hello, Chase. Apparently, there's some technical issue.\nStephane Simonetta: Maybe start to read some of the questions we got, while waiting for people to connect.\nRutger Relker: That's a good idea. That's a good idea. Well, we have already some questions coming in. And the first question I'd like to address is about U.S. tariffs. How will you be affected by these tariffs, both directly and indirectly?\nStephane Simonetta: I think it's maybe a bit too soon to know, but -- if you talk about the U.S. tariff, we don't see them based on what we know today, being a major impact for Aalberts. Actually, it could be even more an opportunity, but I look forward to learn more and to see really what will be implemented because today, between what is said in the news and the reality, it's a bit challenging to know, but we don't expect major impact because we are already quite localized in the U.S. Our strategy has been always to be in the U.S. for the U.S. As you know, in our service business, we do everything in the U.S. In our building, we are factory in the U.S. And in semicon, we are not too much in the U.S. So no major impact for Aalberts at the moment.\nRutger Relker: Then we have some other questions. It's about semicon business. The question is that given that the big semicon equipment manufacturers expect some growth in '25 compared to '24, would you then still expect some growth for the semicon business for the full year despite a weak Q1?\nStephane Simonetta: I think it's a bit too soon to say, right? We have very strong collaboration with our customer, first of all. I think we are there to support them in good time, and when there is more challenging time. So I'm very pleased with the collaboration. Our customer has been very open with us, giving us the warning, giving us the visibility. So now, it's finding the right balance with them. We expect still a challenging first half, and we expect some recovery in the second half, but whether it's second half or it's a bit later, we are there for the long-term. We all know in this segment, it's not about the short term, right? So I think to be too soon to say, but definitely, first half, we still expect some continued destocking.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. Let's see whether the line is working again. And if not, then there are still some more questions popping in. Yes. There's a question about destocking. Can you perhaps quantify, what kind of reductions of inventories we could expect during '25 or '26? Perhaps that's a good question for you, Arno, about the further reduction of inventories.\nArno Monincx: Yes. But we also have written in our annual or let's say, in our press release is that we have an inventory reduction program also to further optimize that in the coming 2 years. And our objective is to reach the 85 days in 2026. So that's a clear objective also for us internally for all the teams to reach that. And it's also quite clear that, the most -- the biggest part of the improvement should come from the Building segment because there, we are too high, and there we need to improve.\nRutger Relker: And for '25, do you expect some improvement already?\nArno Monincx: I expect improvement, yes. But as you can imagine from the 94 days, which was clearly a little bit disappointing, where the slowdown of the fourth quarter did not help in the DIO, of course, but also there, we were a little bit disappointed about the progress that we made -- in some areas we made, but also, like I said, in the Building segment, we need to do better, and that is also where we will focus on, and we are already focusing on, of course, at this moment. So it will, for sure, go down.\nStephane Simonetta: Like Arno said, the inventory situation is not satisfactory. And that's why we are implementing all the operational excellence, the supply chain excellence, implementing all the tools in order to sustain high service level, but with a better mix through our value chain, managing raw materials, work in progress, finished goods. So we have started a few pilots in '24, which have delivered great results. We need now to roll out in the full company, especially in our Building segment.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. I get a message that, it should work again with the live questions. So, let's give it another try –\nStephane Simonetta: First click –\nRutger Relker: And let's give the word to David Kerstens.\nDavid Kerstens: I'm not sure, if you already asked my question because I also submitted via the webcast, but I had a couple. The first one was on how much visibility do you have on the expected organic growth recovery after the first quarter? And what are the key drivers? Do you expect Industry to recover? And how much destocking do you anticipate in semicon and how long will it take? I suspect you already answered that.\nStephane Simonetta: Yes.\nDavid Kerstens: The second question is, how do you feel about your M&A strategy to expand in the Americas in the light of the changing political environment with increasing protectionism? Does that impact the synergy realization of any M&A in the U.S.? And then I had one on the arbitral award. What is it exactly about? It seems a relatively large amount after a period with relatively limited M&A. And then maybe finally, just a housekeeping question. The M&A spent in the cash flow statement was only EUR 19 million. Just to confirm that it doesn't include the acquisition of Paulo yet. So it's only the acquisition of SGP. Those were the questions I had written down.\nStephane Simonetta: So, let me take the first one and then Arno the last 2. So you're right that we are watching very closely the -- like you said, the dynamic in the U.S., but we just see a confirmation that our strategy is right, right, to have more acquisition in the U.S. and to localize more because the growth is still higher, especially for our Building and Industry segment. Going forward, let's see. But of course, in a few years, we may have the question also about the Semicon footprint in the U.S. based on the long-term macroeconomic trend. So this could be an additional opportunity for us. It's not part of our strategy today. But for the long term, that's something we are looking at very carefully.\nArno Monincx: Yes. Let's say then the arbitral award, as I already said in my presentation, that was also for us a surprise, and we clearly disagree with that award. So that is also the reason that we filed for an annulment. I already mentioned, it is M&A related, but because it's arbitration, we cannot say more about that. And still, as you say, the case is still ongoing. So that's the reason. But at the end, we thought, it would be best to take this provision in our books. So that's what we did. And then the last one question you already answered yourself. I think the SGP is indeed the only acquisition we closed last year in the fourth quarter. So, Paulo is still not closed, and we expect that to happen in the second quarter of this year.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, David. Then I'd like to give the word to Alexander Virgo from Bank of America. No, I think he's not responding. So Martijn den Drijver from ABN AMRO is also in the queue.\nMartijn den Drijver: I'm terribly sorry for the other listeners, but I missed all of it. There was a technical problem, I guess. I'm going to ask my questions again. I'm terribly sorry for that. But coming back to building, according to my calculations, you had roughly 5% volume growth in November, December. You gave the number for Q4 as a whole, and you're basically guiding for that 2% in 2025. So my question is, was that very strong performance in the latter part of 2024 only restocking? Or is that low single-digit guidance, which you've basically given just on the conservative side, given that, yes, Germany and France are not doing great, but they're not going to deteriorate either, whereas the other European markets are actually recovering. So that would be question one.\nStephane Simonetta: Okay. Thank you. You are right, but we don't see yet, let's say, like that restocking. So the organic growth is really driven by modest recovery in terms of demand, but we have also a good geographical split as Q4 has been much better also in the U.S. compared to Europe. So that's, I think, what explains where we still have many growth opportunity in the U.S. We have improved our delivery performance. And in Europe, we have been very strong in some of the niche and innovation, and that we will continue to see. What will make, like you mentioned, us to be even better is what will happen on the new construction in the French and the Germany market, and that is difficult to see at the moment. So we still believe in our outlook to have a small growth as a totality between the good news and still the uncertainty on the market, especially on the new build and in West Europe.\nMartijn den Drijver: Got it. Then my second question is with regards to semicon. And it's clear that, that destocking hit you guys in Q4 and it's going to continue in Q1 2025. Can you talk about the phasing throughout the year for 2025 and perhaps also give your indications with regards to 2026? It used to be that you expect a double-digit organic growth for 2026. Is that still in the books? Or should we be a little bit more cautious given that destocking events going on today?\nStephane Simonetta: Again, let me first be very clear. The long-term Semicon industry remains strong. So it's just a short-term and timing issue. And I think now the good news is every quarter, we will be reporting. So I think, we will be telling you a bit more, early May when we publish our Q1 results. As of today, we can only tell you, what we wrote that we see a flat organic revenue growth, which still destocking in Q1. And yes, there could be some recovery in the second half of the year. But will it be in the second half or will it be in Q1? That's still to be seen. But long term, the expectation are still there to grow the business driven by all the new technology, driven by AI. So, we are part of it. So we follow, I think, the long-term growth with all our technology differentiation. And then, we will add our capability and our footprint in Asia to have even more growth and also have more diversified portfolio. So short-term, I think we'll report every quarter, but long-term, still a good outlook.\nMartijn den Drijver: I understand. Just one small follow-up. The company, Aalberts, has always indicated that there's little visibility in surface technology, so industry and little in building, but rather good visibility in semicon. What's changed now that you don't feel comfortable enough to talk about that phasing in future quarters?\nStephane Simonetta: We still have a good visibility. I think we -- the question is when our customer will start to ask for more and where they will stop in their destocking. So we still have the visibility. I think I mentioned before earlier, we have good collaboration, and we work hand in hand with them. So, I think that's not changed. We still have the good visibility. And that's why we are able to give, I think, a Q1 outlook and a full year outlook. And that's why we are also confirming the long term because we know there is still growth in the future. That's why we still continue to invest in the long term with our footprint, with our technology. So -- it's just a timing issue between what will be in '25, what will be in '26. I think that's still to come, but we still have the same visibility, long-term growth, short-term destocking.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. Clear. And then my final question is for Arno on the working capital and the inventory reduction. It did not materialize as perhaps some might have hoped for. Are you comfortable enough to talk about what you expect in terms of DIO, not an exact number, but perhaps a range? And can you perhaps shed a little bit more light, add more color on to what exactly you're going to do to get that DIO down?\nArno Monincx: You clearly missed it, Martijn, because I explained it earlier in this Q&A. Our clear objective is to reach the 85 days of DIO in 2026. That is what we work on. And we have been focusing also, of course, last year on inventory reduction. Now clearly, it did not materialize what we expected from it. But also there, it's -- the major improvement needs to come from the building segment. So that is also where the most actions are to improve. And we will continue to do so. And we are also confident with all the plans that we have now that we will realize this. Otherwise, we would not, of course, give this guidance also until 2026.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. And just one follow-up. Is that a linear process? Or is it more back-end loaded?\nStephane Simonetta: It will be a continuous improvement process.\nArno Monincx: Yes.\nStephane Simonetta: I think you will -- we will report this, I think, every semester. So you will see. But of course, it should not be only back-end loaded. We have to make improvement already this year because last year was not satisfactory. The good news is you see, the overall DIO of 94 days in 2024, but don't underestimate that the mix is quite different. So some of our product line in Building have been able to go down because they have been applying all the tools, all the supply chain excellence, all the operational excellence. Now, we need to roll out that to the low performer of the company. And as a consequence, our building segment should be much better.\nArno Monincx: Yes. And because of the fact that, we also now communicated in the press release, you can count on the accountability also in ours internally on this topic. So we will make this.\nRutger Relker: Okay. Thank you for this moment, Martijn. We have 2 more people in the queue. [Operator Instructions] Alex Virgo from Bank of America.\nAlex Virgo: I'm going to try and steer away from asking questions that have already been asked. I wondered, Arno, if you could just run through some of those exceptional items, EUR 120 million is a big number. I appreciate you've talked about the provision. But if you could just give a sense of what is driving those different moving parts? And is there a number we need to think about already for 2025? That's one question. I guess, if you could do that within the context of both EBIT and free cash because there are obviously adjustments in both instances, and they're not all the same. So I'd appreciate a little bit of clarification on that. And then a question for Stephane. I guess, the question really is, as we look at Q4 and down 10-ish in industry and semicon, and the guidance for Q1 of minus 5%. Obviously, flat for the full year does imply a decent amount of acceleration. I think you've been asked a question on visibility, but maybe it's less about visibility and more just about thinking what is it that surprised you about the weakness in Q4? And how do you think about managing that cadence as we go through 2025?\nArno Monincx: Okay. Let me start with the exceptional cost, maybe, EUR 120.5 million. It's indeed a big number. And it's also something, of course, we could not do differently, like the decision to leave Russia. It's a clear decision from our side that this is not the future for Aalberts to continue in this market. So that is what we did there, and that led to an impairment of our assets in the books. And the outcome of the arbitration award was also for us unexpected, and therefore, also we filed for an annulment. I cannot unfortunately say more about this one, because it's still under the arbitration tribunal. Last, but not least, the acceleration program. I think, yes, we were quite clear already in November that we would announce this, and that is what we did. And you can read also in the annual benefit, the recurring annual benefit of EUR 30 million versus an investment of EUR 54.8 million. That's quite a quite good program, and it will sustain our margin improvement going forward. And yes, we will continue to do so also in next year in 2025 to look for further improvement possibilities whenever we can. That has been the nature of our business over the last, yes, let's say, decade, I would say, and will also be the nature of our business going forward. We will always try to look for further improvements. And with a footprint like we have and with all the initiatives that we are doing also going forward to make the business more efficient and more lean I mean, there will always be possibilities. And timing is the natural cascador of this program. So we will continue to do so. I'm not so sure regarding cash, what your question was, because we are reporting, of course, our numbers before exceptionals so that you can still track our operating results in the right way, and that is also what we did this year. And maybe you have another question about it.\nAlex Virgo: I guess, it's just to make sure whether we think about modeling 2025, I appreciate the whole point of exceptionals are that they are exceptionals, but presumably, or it's an open question, maybe I'm presuming wrong. Are there things that we need to think about that would end up being in that -- in those lines for 2025 to make sure that, again, we're looking at the right numbers, comparable numbers year-on-year?\nArno Monincx: Let's say, the impairment is, of course, a noncash item of the Russian activity. So that is, I think, clear. The arbitrational award to be seen, I cannot say anything about it, but let's say, to be seen. And let's say, once we think it's time to make aware, if there's another program going forward for 2025, we will, of course, communicate that. But this program clearly brings a benefit of EUR 30 million annually, of which, by the way, EUR 10 million was already taken into the books in 2024. So, the incremental benefit should be around EUR 20 million with regard to this --\nAlex Virgo: Okay. And all the costs associated with that, you've now taken.\nArno Monincx: Yes.\nStephane Simonetta: Yes. And then I think on Q1, it's a -- we see a bit of continuation of what we saw in Q4. So continue to have a moderate organic growth in our building segment, and still low activity in our industry segment due to mostly, again, automotive, machine build and still low activity for our frame and module due to the destocking from our customers. So that's the visibility we have right now. That's why we are able to give this outlook for the group.\nRutger Relker: I now would like to give the word to Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen.\nChase Coughlan: I just have 2 questions regarding the 2025 guidance. Firstly, on the flat organic revenue guidance. I know, some peers in the U.S. have spoken to already increasing prices slightly in Q1 of this year, at least from the building side. I'm curious on -- could you comment on the sort of pricing volume dynamics that's baked into that 2025 guidance?\nArno Monincx: Yes. I think, we are more optimistic and never will we compromise on price. That's why even in the negative organic growth, we are being to sustain in building very strong added value, that's the Aalberts way. So we continue to push and we see opportunity on the pricing increase. Some already have been announced. So, we are well on track in 2025 also in the U.S.\nChase Coughlan: But then should we also -- by that means we should expect some slight volume declines if we expect organic flat in 2025? Or how should I read that?\nStephane Simonetta: I think, it's again, the geographical, you understand that U.S. will be better, both volume and pricing. Europe, some product line will also be better. But today, we still don't see recovery for many of our product lines in France, in Germany, in all the new build and in our connection systems. So as a sum, we see a flat, but you are right, U.S. should be much better. And then Europe will be still challenged, especially with –\nChase Coughlan: Okay. That's very clear.\nStephane Simonetta: And we are hopeful also, I forgot to mention about East Europe also. That could be also maybe not in Q1, but Q2 could be a bit better to have more growth. That's something we were also expecting last year, didn't materialize. So the point of time, the market need to recover also in East Europe.\nChase Coughlan: Okay. Great. And then maybe secondly, on the margin guidance, so the EBITA margin guidance expansion basically. Should we expect that most of that comes from the building segment given the sort of, let's say, growth expected there versus maybe a still very weak industry environment? Or how should we look at the divisional expectations for the margin in 2025?\nArno Monincx: That's a good assumption.\nStephane Simonetta: Obviously, you clearly see, right, in Industry, we need to sustain our performance, whatever is the organic growth. Semicon, we also need to sustain will be challenging. Q1 will be challenging due to the destocking, but this is not where we have the big opportunity, and this is not part of our strategy, right? So to reach the 16% in '25, most of the improvement are in our Building segment.\nRutger Relker: Martijn, you still had some questions. So I give Martijn den Drijver from ABN AMRO opportunity to ask some additional questions.\nMartijn den Drijver: Coming back to semicon. If you look at the growth you've had, the 4.7% organic growth and you look at the improvement in an absolute sense of EBITA, that doesn't reflect the normal targeted drop-down rate of 25%. The first question is, does that 25% rule or guidance still count? And secondly, is that due to the fact that, there's been a capacity expansion at IDE? You already have some OpEx investments for the expansion in the Frame business at Mogema. Is that an explanation why we don't see that normal operating leverage in semicon? That would be my first question.\nArno Monincx: Shall I answer this, Martijn?\nMartijn den Drijver: Go ahead.\nArno Monincx: You can now also see in the quarterly results that we made good growth performance over the last quarters, except for the last quarter where the growth of 10.8% in Q3 turned around to 10.4% decline in Q4. That's a big difference, of course. And you can imagine, when you're in the growth modus with this business that the drop-through is also normally able to realize. But with this decline and big difference in the last quarter, of course, that had clearly a negative effect in the EBITA margin. That's the answer I can give to you. We still are behind our objective to reach 25% drop-through on organic growth. So that remains an objective internally and also possible.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. And then my second question is, again, on industry. Despite that volume decline, margins have held up well. But at a certain point in time, the flexibilization of certain costs has an end to it. So what can you do from this point forward to maintain that profitable level, that high level of EBITA margin? And secondly, you talked at the first half year results about sales mix changes, positive sales mix changes, so higher level value-add services. Is that something that could drive -- could sustain or help you in terms of EBITA margins for industry?\nStephane Simonetta: Good question. I think, first of all, the footprint optimization is not finished. We still have many opportunities to optimize our footprint in our industry segment, right? Some of the operational excellence program and some of the EUR 55 million we have announced, it's all between building and industry and that will also generate results in '25. And we are already working on the next one. Hopefully, there will be even higher growth and the profitability will go higher. So we have still some footprint optimization within our Surface Tech. And as you know, in the CMD, even it's a Service business, but this is still today 60% of our business. And then where we produce components, what we call our industrial product, here, we still have the same operational excellence agenda to drive leaner, better machine utilization, direct labor productivity. So this is also on the, you could say, 30%, 40% of our industry segment, where we can use the same recipe as we are planning to use in our building segment. So that are the action. And that's what we can do whatever is organic growth.\nArno Monincx: And besides cost optimization, of course, the portfolio has clearly improved. And with the M&A we have done over the last, let's say, 5, 6 years, we clearly strengthened our -- let's say, high margin, high specification business also in the industry segment. And that is clearly helping to sustain these margins going forward.\nStephane Simonetta: It's a good point, because it's -- I'm sure you noticed in the portfolio optimization side with our strategy and action, where do we see the divestment part of our thrive 2030 is between our building and industry segment. So this is where we have also some portfolio or some businesses where we don't see us being the best owner for the future.\nMartijn den Drijver: Two more small questions. The question from my colleague from Bank of America on cash flow. The EUR 54.8 million restructuring charge, how much of that will lead to a cash out in 2025? Is that EUR 5 million, EUR 10 million? Or is it all already done?\nArno Monincx: If you give me some time to check that one second. Because I think --\nStephane Simonetta: Maybe you want to ask another question in the meantime?\nMartijn den Drijver: Yes, please. Yes, please. And my final question, it's actually another small question. The share buyback, EUR 75 million. I can -- would it be fair to say that you would prefer a steady share buyback policy that you would not prefer to go up and down, up and down, but that you would have a steady line? Or should we just think about it if you've done 2 or 3 Paulo's and it goes down? Or do you -- coming back to the first part, or would you like it to be pretty consistent level?\nStephane Simonetta: I think, I can only repeat what we say in the CMD. You remember with our capital allocation strategy, what we will prioritize. And I think we said, and Arno will add that we will do share buyback when we have excess cash available. So I think, we are committed to do it on a yearly basis. The amount will depend on what is cash available, because first, we fuel our strategy. We do our organic growth initiative. Then, we do our acquisition. We will continue to return solid and improve the dividend and do share buyback. The amount will depend every year, but we are committed to do it on the yearly basis. So, a steady program and the amount to be confirmed.\nArno Monincx: And your other question, Martijn, we made a specification of our operational excellence projects in the cost lines. And I can tell you that from the personnel part, approximately EUR 20 million still has to go into the cash and there may be some EUR 5 million or EUR 10 million other costs that are still going through the cash. The rest is noncash items.\nRutger Relker: And I'd like to give the word to Ruben Devos from Kepler Cheuvreux.\nRuben Devos: I just had the first one was a quick one just on electrification. I think you singled that out as a significant opportunity. Obviously, we had not a great 2024 in terms of EV penetration rates globally, specifically not in Europe. But for '25, things start to look better again. Just curious whether you could sort of quantify the opportunity for us or just give an indication what that electrification or automotive in general represents of total group sales today?\nStephane Simonetta: So electrification, first, you have 2 parts, right? You have the part in automotive and the rest. So in automotive, I can only confirm what we just said, right? We see the same headwinds as we saw in 2024, which is a global automotive industry and what our customers or what the OEM or the Tier 1 are asking to us. But on the long term, it remains a growth driver. For '25, I don't see major changes yet, but we still see it a growth driver for the long term in automotive, but in other industries. So electrification in other -- especially in Europe and to deliver the European green deal or to have, I think, a better opportunity for us. So that's still too soon to say, but no major change at the moment for '25.\nRuben Devos: Okay. Can you remind us what automotive represents in industry now with the new segment reporting?\nStephane Simonetta: Yes, roughly 40%, like we shared in the Capital Markets Day, so 40%, and that's –\nRuben Devos: Of industry?\nStephane Simonetta: Of industry, yes, of industry.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And then on semicon, just -- yes, obviously, this is a cyclical industry. We all know that, and I sort of agree that this will be likely transitory in nature. But just interested to hear whether you have some exposure to the aftermarket and service business in semicon as well, which is a bit countercyclical.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question. That's actually what we mean. Maybe we were not clear in the refurbishment. This is a service business. This is an aftermarket -- so we just opened a new site here in the Netherlands close to our customer in order to be able to refurbish any of their module and to give them a second life. That's what we mean, and that will be part of the aftermarket. And this is still small, but this is a growth initiative for us.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And then maybe somewhat of a conceptual question. Just thinking about the green agenda, right? I think, obviously, there's been a lot of policy changes globally. You see the elections in the U.S. We see how that sort of is translating into new policies in Europe. You've got evolving regulations, et cetera. I mean, just thinking about sort of the latest strategies or thoughts that some of your customers might have around energy efficiency, decarbonization, sustainable building materials. Like what has changed in your view maybe in the past 12 to 24 months? Are you seeing any aversion towards the green agenda? I mean, more than what it might have been 2 years ago? Or how do you think about that?\nStephane Simonetta: It's a good question. Let me say that first, in the U.S., no major change because the green agenda was never a growth driver, right? That was the activity, that was the consumption, that was the inflation, and that has not changed. So with more -- or with less green agenda in the U.S., no impact for us. Of course, we were hoping to have a greener agenda to accelerate even more the growth. But even without the green agenda, U.S. will be a growth agenda. So no major change. And in Europe, we still believe in it for the long-term because more people will continue to live in urban city and still so many old buildings that need to be renovated and still a lot of energy efficiency gain. And we are well positioned to support the energy transition in Europe. So we remain optimistic. I remain optimistic, because as European, we have to do a better job also to deliver the European green deal and Aalberts is super well positioned to deliver that. And let's not forget that on industry, we still see many of our customers asking us for lightweight solution, reducing also fuel consumption, which can help on the environment, but which is also a cost-saving opportunity for them. So no, I would say, no major change, but I really hope the European Union will still be pushing this agenda.\nArno Monincx: And don't forget that all these new systems where we are also providing our products that are also giving more comfort. So it's not only energy saving. It's also more comfort in the Building. So it goes together, and that's called innovation, right? So you have new technology which functional better performance, like with lightweight materials. Let's say, there's always a trend to do things better, lighter, faster. So that goes along with, of course, also, let's say, renewable thinking. So I think that is not a major concern.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Ruben. I think we have some questions still coming via the webcast. First is a question to Arno, and that's about CapEx for building, which has increased in '24 compared to '23 despite organic decline over the last 2 years. Could you comment a bit on that?\nArno Monincx: Of course, this is -- these are a lot of initiatives that we already started in the years before, which take longer than 1 year. So it's also the timing and the running out of startup programs. But we expect clearly that, CapEx will go down in the period ahead of us in building. But this is just the finalization of projects that have been started already some time ago. And it's all about optimization, footprint extension, optimization, a lot of good things when volumes will return in our factories, that will help to also improve our margin going forward.\nRutger Relker: So for CapEx, '24 was a peak?\nArno Monincx: Right, quite a peak moment, yes.\nStephane Simonetta: I think it's -- you should expect that -- first of all, we are still aligned with our EUR 200 million, EUR 250 million, but that was including a lot of green project factories, which are almost done. So of course, beyond '25, we should go back more to a normalized CapEx without all this greenfield. And now the goal is to use and have all the growth and have a massive asset utilization that will help also to improve EBITDA beyond 2026 and towards the 18% goal that we have in our thrive 2030.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Stephane and Arno. There's another question coming in, which is a bit technical about the gain on the disposal that we had, whether that has been included or not into the EBIT of this year.\nArno Monincx: It is included. So the capital gain we made this year, approximately EUR 9 million, that's including our holding eliminations. And let me repeat the philosophy about that. In our holding eliminations, we report extraordinary costs and extraordinary income that have nothing to do with the operations of our businesses. So the 3 segments are reported clean and all the exceptionals we take in the holding eliminations. In this year also, we had extraordinary income like the disposal, which was approximately EUR 9 million, but we also had extraordinary costs in our holding elimination, because the total holding eliminations is approximately EUR 1 million, let's say, less negative than 2023, where we had also this situation, and that is actually driven by the fact that the holding costs were a little bit lower than last year. So from extraordinary income and costs, we are about on the same level as in 2023. The exceptional program, right, the exceptional costs, the restructuring costs are not in the holding elimination line. These are reported outside the operating results.\nRutger Relker: Thank you for clarification, Arno. There's a question about divestments, whether you would expect the divestments to happen in '25 or only as per '26?\nStephane Simonetta: We will always do divestments. First, we have a clear strategy, a clear funnel, and it's all about timing, but it's not also about timing, it's having the right deal and the right offer. The good news is we are not under pressure to do the divestment. We will do it when we have the right deal, the right valuation, but also when we believe it is the right ownership for the business we want to divest. So it could be in '25, it could be in '26. Let's see. The only thing we can tell you, it is between building and industry. But some could be in '25.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. And then I see, I think at this moment, the last question from the webcast, and that's about innovation where innovation rate declined a little bit from 20% to 19% despite being a priority for Aalberts. Could you comment a bit on that perhaps?\nStephane Simonetta: A small decline, if you round up. So you could say, first, it's good because we sustain 19%, 20%. But for me, it's looking back, right? As you know, in the last 4 years revenue, which is coming from innovative. And you can imagine that in our portfolio, there is a huge diversity. Some of our product lines are doing very well, much higher than 20%. And I can tell you this is where we have also the better growth and the better margins. And some of our product line from innovation rate are very low. What a surprise that, this is also where we have the lowest margin. So that is why innovation is so fundamental for us. The good news is we have some successful story. So up to us to bring the one which are higher, sustain the one which are higher and continue as per our thrive 2000 strategy to be always more than 20% to keep our differentiation, right? And it could be some great products like I've shown in our organic growth, could be some solution, could be some system or it could be some digital offering.\nRutger Relker: Thank you very much. I still see one last question coming in. Yes. That's still on the CapEx. Whether you also expect still to have your CapEx range, EUR 200 million, EUR 250 million until '26 and only after '26 see an increase?\nArno Monincx: Yes, I think that is correct. So for 2025 and 2026, we see this range of EUR 200 million to EUR 250 million. And beyond 2026, we gave in the Capital Markets Day, let's say, the outlook until 2030 with yes, higher CapEx number, but don't forget the business is also growing. So our ambition is to go to EUR 4.5 billion in 2030. So the CapEx, let's say, percentage spend on revenue is even going down with this number.\nStephane Simonetta: The new range of CapEx, to be very clear, will only materialize if we are successful with all our acquisition. If you keep the current business as of today, the CapEx intensity will go down, thanks to our efficiencies, thanks to our improvement, thanks to all our measures. So we will spend more, hopefully, because that will mean we have done great acquisition that will strengthen our portfolio, with a higher growth and higher margins.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. Well, I think we've answered all questions coming in. So as we conclude today's webcast, I would like to thank each of you for your participation. We hope today's presentation has provided you with a clear understanding of our achievements, our financial health and confirmed our strategic direction going forward. Thank you once again for joining us today.",

    "fullTranscript": "Rutger Relker: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. It is my pleasure to welcome you to Aalberts First Half 2024. My name is Rutger Relker, Director, Investor Relations. This morning we published our interim results. We delivered a 15% EBITA margin in challenging markets. Together with our CEO, Stephane Simonetta and our CFO, Arno Monincx, we will look back to the first half of 2024 and we will look forward to the second half 2024. Stephane will kick off the presentation with some key highlights. This will be followed by Arno who will give a financial update. Stephane will then share our strategic priorities and outlook. After the presentation we will give you the opportunity to engage directly with us in the Q&A session. Your questions and feedback are very important to us and we encourage you to participate. Later today we will make both the presentation and the recording of this webcast available on our website. Please welcome Stephane Simonetta to begin our presentation.\nStephane Simonetta : Thank you, Rutger. Good morning, everyone. So the first six months of the year have been challenging as we saw lower activity at our customers, especially at wins in building technology. But we have improved, thanks to the work of our teams, to improve our added value margins and we improve our profitability in our Industrial Technology segment. As a whole, we are delivering 15% EBITA margin, thanks to our cost saving and robust price level. And as you see on this slide, that are the key highlights about our first half performance with an organic growth at minus 3.9%, with an EBITA at 15% of €242 million, and an added value at 63.8%, which has improved as Arno will explain later, in both actually of segment compared to last year. As we always do, we are adjusting our costs, especially fixed costs thanks to our structural cost saving. And you can imagine that most of the cost savings are on our Building Technology segment and we are deploying and executing our inventory reduction plan to be back on track at the end of the year. Despite the short-term challenges, we continue to invest for the long term and that's why our CapEx is in plan with last year. We deliver an EPS at €1.61 and we continue to deploy our four strategic actions. I'll give you more color later on. So overall, we continue to execute our strategy. We have delivered 15% EBITA and we are well positioned for the rebound of the activity. When you look at the operational development, let me give you a bit of color for each of our end markets. And starting with building technology, our eco-friendly buildings, this is where we see lower activity in Europe, especially in Germany. But despite all these challenges, our added value margin has improved in our eco-friendly building, thanks to our robust pricing, our sales initiative and our purchasing actions. We continue to see a decreasing lower end-user demand in new builds and softer demand in renovation. As expected, the stock level at our wholesaler were still low, but we continue to see better activity in Americas, in Asia and in some product lines, we are actually doing better than the market. As an example, our grooved technologies, our water treatment offering, our pressurization and storage tank, our safety and efficiency valve are actually doing better than the market, which means we are winning some shares compared to the market trends. In the US, we are still working to improve our service level and this is where we are expecting a better second half on our commercial valve. And we see the positive trend on some new verticals, especially the data center, where we are also working on offering an innovative solution for our customers. Despite this short-term volatile demand, long-term it remains a growth agenda because the energy, the resource efficiency, in both residential and commercial buildings, they remain long-term growth drivers. But as you have seen, this is mostly in this vertical that we see the biggest challenge. Because on the other hand, everything linked to our industrial technology is actually doing much better and semiconductor efficiency continues to grow. Despite some short-term volatile demand, we are improving our service and our order book remains at a high level. And we continue to see very strong demand on our advanced mechatronics module with more and more system integration, especially as you all know for our lithography and inspection application. We see more and more, which is good news for our sustainability agenda, need for refurbishment from our customers. And this is a growth enabler on top of the technology trend. And we are continuing to invest for the long-term, because we need more capacity to serve and deliver the growth from our customers. So very confident and we expect a much stronger ’25 in this industry because there is positive technology trend like AI technology that will bring additional demand. In sustainable transportation, we have once again, this just shows our resilience, a very solid performance, and because also here we see a mixed demand with lower in automotive but continued growth in aerospace. So we are, I think, delivering as usual and flexing our costs to sustain some solid margins. And that's why we are able to follow the trend, especially in automotive. And we continue to see high growth for the high precision manufacturing parts, especially also some good opportunity on surface technology, because there is more and more need for lightweight material. And we are also continuing here to support the e-mobility agenda, sustainability and all the reshoring continue to be growth driver in this end market. Industrial niche, a bit more challenge because of course here it's following the overall economy and we see some lower demand, especially in West Europe. Once again, also the Germany is more challenging with overall industrial need going down. Also US, and we continue to see growth in Asia. So we are adjusting our costs, but the order intake continue to be very strong on the other hand in the US for industrial value and that's why we expect also a second half to be better and we still see growth opportunity. That's what we are working on, to capture a growth and win share in North America on our industrial value. So in a nutshell, that's where we have been doing on the first half with very strong picture on industrial where we are able to continue the growth on semicon, more stability on sustainable transportation and more challenging on industry. And then we are taking all the measure to secure our margins on eco-friendly buildings. Let me now hand you over to Arno. Arno?\nArno Monincx : Yeah, thank you, Stephane. Good morning everybody also from my side. I would like to take you through the financial development of Aalberts, over the first half of 2024. Starting with the revenue where you see the decline of 3.9% organically over the first six months versus last year and where we see the headwind in building, as Stephane also explained, ending up in 6.7% organic decline for building technology; and then industrial, a reasonably flat situation, minus 0.4% which is actually given the market circumstances also in industrial, quite a strong performance. In total it's minus 3.9%. And the EBITA margin, there we sustained a good added value. We even improved our added value as Stephane said, with 1.5%, which is a great result and a great performance of the teams and that is clearly always our strategy that we really protect our added value margin because there it all begins with the earnings of course. So there we are still with 63.8% at a very good level and that is also one of the reasons that we could at least keep our profitability to the level of 50.0% although it's a decline of 0.4% but still 50.0% in challenging market situations. The earnings per share before the amortization, let's say the net profit before the amortization ended up at €178 million and also there we see that the net finance costs were clearly lower than last year but that is also a positive thing and that also helps to at least have €1.61 per share as an EPS versus the €1.71 last year. Then the cash flow from operations where we decreased from €221 million in the first half of ’23 to €182 million in the first half of ’24 and we have also put here the two main reasons for that. First of all, of course a lower EBITA level, a €16 million effect to this operational cash flow and the other one is the network capital move of, let's say, which was €27 million lower than the move last year. And that clearly has to do with the normal seasonality trend that you build up stock in the first half year and you reduce your stocks in the second half year. Also because of the seasonality and where we had the situation in the first half of ’23 as we came from a very high stock level in ’22, at the end of ’22 due to all the supply chain issues as you may remember. So that was clearly let's say a positive situation for the cash flow in the first half of ’23. But this gives more or less the normal seasonality. Then the revenue per end market, where we see eco-friendly builds with 51% actually quite stable, semicon efficiency continued to increase in the share of the total towards 15%, sustainable transportation also slight increase to 17% and here we see the industrial niches are really reducing towards the 17%, coming from 19%, full year ’23. The revenue per region, I must say quite stable, actually there's not a lot of change. The only thing is that APAC, Middle East, Africa is 1% lower than full year ’23 and Western Europe is 1% higher than full year ’23. The revenue bridge, coming from the first half of ’23, €1.717 billion, then we have no effect from acquisitions in the first half of ’24. The net effect of the disposals, the divestments versus 2023 was €37.3 million with the loss of revenues that had to do of course with the divestment of Disptek. Currency effect, the small plus €3.8 million mainly impacted by Great British pound and Polish zloty and then it results in the organic revenue decline of €64.8 million, again the 3.9% as explained earlier and that is totalizing towards the €1.618 billion we realized over the first half of ’24. The same for the EBITA bridge where we started from €264.2 million over the first half of ’23, no effects from acquisitions, we lost €4.9 million versus last year due to the divestment of Disptek we did in ’23, and then we had a slight positive translation impact mainly again Great British pounds and Polish zloty of €0.4 million. And that results in the organic EBITA decline of €17.5 million of EBITA lost and that is as said earlier, mainly realized in building technology driven by lower volume where we saw the margins going down from 14.0% to 13.0%. I will explain in the next slides also and where we still see that Industrial Technology improved the EBITA margin but also come back to that in the next slide. The Building Technology segment revenue came down from €932 million to the €873 million in the first half which was the 6.7% organic decline versus the minus 1.5% decline we faced in the first half of ’23. The added value improved, thanks to robust pricing also mentioned by Stephane, sales initiatives and purchasing actions and we believe that our teams also in this difficult market circumstances did a great job to protect their added value. And that at the end helped a lot to sustain the EBITA margin to the 13.0% that we reported versus the 14.0% last year. And let's say also here we see that the capital expenditure we continue to invest despite difficult market circumstances. So that's also, yeah we are we are still investing for the long term of course because we believe that the long term perspective also for building is still positive. Last but not least, America and APAC we saw better activity than in Europe. Then the Industrial Technology segment, also a slight decrease of revenues from €785 million to €746 million which organically was let's say only minus 0.4% because also here of course we faced the disposal of Disptek. And don't forget that last year the first half of ’23 we really had a very strong organic growth performance in Industrial Technology of plus 16%. Then the EBITA margin, despite the lower volume we managed to improve our EBITA margin and there the teams really did a great job to flex their costs also with slightly lower volumes to even be able to improve EBITA margin to this good performance of 17.8% in the first half. Also here we continue to invest although the CapEx is slightly lower, that is related to the timing because also in Industrial Technology segment we will continue to invest for the long term. And again, continued growth in semicon efficiency, a stable activity in sustainable transportation, and a lower activity in the industrial niches that is the takeaway from the three end markets. Then the two segments divided geographically from their revenues, we see 54% Western European building technology which is a little bit higher in the total than the full year and for the rest, I would say there's not so much change. Also in the Industrial Technology segment it's only slight changes Eastern Europe but for the rest -- Eastern Europe is a little bit lower than last year, for the rest it's more or less the same. Stephane, back to you.\nStephane Simonetta : Thank you, Arno. So when we talk about strategy deployment, as you know we have our six KPIs where we made a great progress last year and we continue to work on this one. And as you know in 2023 we were at the ’26 target on SDG, on innovation rate, on leverage ratio, getting close on EBITA margin and continuing the improvement on ROCE and then with some way to go still on organic growth. So we continue to work on this six KPI in ’24 and let me report now some progress on our four strategic actions and the first one is our portfolio optimization. Like we mentioned also in our full year results presentation, it's both acquisition and divestment. So on the acquisition side no change, we continue to prioritize three areas where we want to grow inorganically. In hydronic flow control which is still a mix between new technologies that we want to add in our portfolio, but also in the USA. In advanced mechatronics, which is also a mix between new technologies in our portfolio, but also looking at the Southeast Asia footprint and USA, as I mentioned before, but also looking at some of the bolt-on acquisition on surface technologies. In divestments, we continue to look at our portfolio and we will divest when we believe we are not the best owner on some of our businesses, as we have done in the past. The organic growth, really, and trying to continue the growth in the US, in Asia, to have also a more geographical balance overall and growing, thanks to our innovation. And we see that this is where we have been able in the first half to have some growth in some niche, thanks to innovative solutions in our eco-friendly building, thanks to the, of course, semicon efficiency trend, but also in aerospace. And that's also what we want to continue to increase our innovation power. And we continue, and because it's also geographical expansion, in Mexico for surface technology and in the Netherlands, also for semicon efficiency and some eco-friendly building, where we have also had some extra capacity to support the sustainability agenda in Europe. Operational excellence, I think the first half is a good example of what it means, right? Thanks to the great job of our pricing excellence, that's what also always means, right? When there is more stable volume, how can you do better? And so that's what we have been doing in the first half. Pricing excellence, structural cost reduction, and footprint optimization, we continue, and of course, we will make some progress in ’24 towards our ’26 goal. And we are accelerating, continuing the continuous improvement, especially in the business and where we have more operational challenge, not only to reduce costs, but also to improve service level and reduce our inventories, right? That’s operational excellence. And you can imagine that we have a lot of prioritization in our Building Technology segment to address these challenges. But let's not forget something also very important to us, that we continue to drive our sustainability initiative, improving our health and safety for all our employees. We make some good progress in the first half, and we continue, and also preparing next year annual report as per the CSRD regulation, and we are preparing everything, working on circular economy together with our customers. So overall, continuing to make progress on the whole ESG agenda with all the KPI and the initiative we are working on. So we expect to report some good progress also next year in our next annual report. So when you look at the outlook, all more especially the second half, right? So what do we expect for the second half? First of all, we expect the soft market in eco-friendly buildings to continue, especially in Europe, and we continue to see opportunity to grow, to do better in the US and in Asia. On the other hand, on Industrial Technology, we still remain confident for the long term with a semicon growth agenda and industry more a mixed picture, as I mentioned, between aerospace, automotive, more stable, so different by technology, by regions, and also by end market. Portfolio optimization, we continue to stay disciplined in our capital allocation, so doing CapEx, but also ready to make some bolt-on acquisition and optimize our portfolio. So we continue to make good progress here. And as I mentioned, we will continue to provide more transparency, especially on our scope 3 emission, more upstream in our value chain to also make progress in this area. So overall, we remain very well positioned for the rebound of the activity, thanks to the deployment of our initiative, thanks to the restructuring costs we took, and thanks to the market trend, as we have been doing in the first half. The outlook is not changing and we are still in deployment mode in 2024 with our four strategic actions, that's what I mentioned at the beginning, so organic growth, operational excellence, portfolio optimization, and sustainable entrepreneurship. But what we are planning at the end of the year is a new Capital Market Day that we will do on the 10th December, and because I think it's after three years, it is time to give an update on our strategy, and also because 2026 is getting closer, so we have decided to give to all of you and to all our stakeholders an update on our strategy at the end of 2024. That's all I wanted to share with you, and let me back and hand it over to Rutger. Thank you very much.\nA - Rutger Relker: Thank you, Arno and Stephane. As we are starting the Q&A session, I’d like to remind everyone how to participate. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to give the word to David Kerstens from Jefferies for the first questions.\nDavid Kerstens : Yes, good morning. Thank you very much, Rutger. I've got three questions, please. First of all, can you explain the deterioration in organic revenues in the months May and June? I think minus 5% in industrial tech and 8% in building tech, particularly in industrial tech, notably weaker than in the first four months of the year. And then maybe the second question, what is the impact of weakening incentives to move towards heat pumps? I think the new Dutch government wants to abolish the mandatory change towards heat pumps. Maybe we can keep gas boilers from 2026. I think previously you talked about the positive impact from replacing 65 million gas boilers in Europe. What will be the impact if we can still keep gas boilers? And then maybe finally, do you see some signs of inventory restocking already in the second half of the year ahead of the expected recovery in demand later this year? Thank you very much.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you. Good and great question. So the industrial technology, it's very tactical and short term, like you mentioned, because I think many of our customers, especially in the German market and in our surface treatment, have been managing their half-year results and basically stopping and postponing a lot of their services from June to the second half. So that's why the June months, so it's a very short term issue, they have been optimizing and postponing things to the second half. That's why the June months have been more challenging on industrial technologies. The second point is, you are right, I think we see it, the stock remains very high at our customers on heat pumps and they are really struggling to get that out of their doors because they are less and less incentive by the government. But for us, it's actually, I would say, more neutral because we are still using expansion vessels when you need gas boilers and actually we see a unique growth. You may have seen in our operational update that we are winning shares and we are doing better than the market trend on expansion vessels because you need more units on gas boilers than on heat pumps and then the installer can do more jobs to install gas boilers than to do heat pumps. So I would say it's a neutral but if you look at the unit, it's slightly positive for us when you see this trend. And the third point, I think here also talking to our customers I’ve been visiting, we are more cautious that the stock will continue to remain very low, right? Because that's what we see from our customers, so we expect and continue to see soft demand in the second half and we are not expecting a huge restocking before next year.\nDavid Kerstens : Okay, that’s clear, thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, David. Martijn, are you there?\nStephane Simonetta: I think he's not there.\nRutger Relker: No, apparently not.\nMartijn den Drijver: No, no, I am.\nRutger Relker: Ah, you are. Okay, sorry. Good morning.\nMartijn den Drijver: I am. Can you hear me now, guys?\nRutger Relker: Yes. I can hear you.\nMartijn den Drijver: Good. I apologize, I couldn't hear you. Okay, everything's fine, at least in terms of audio. My first question would be about building technology. You mentioned that the value add was up also for building technology, but your EBITA margin is down. Normally, I would expect if your value add goes up, that your EBITA would go up. So what's driving, despite that better value add, that decline in EBITA margin for building tech? That's question one and I'll do them one by one.\nArno Monincx: Okay, let me take that question, Martijn. Yes, we are quite, let's say, happy with the added value developments that we realized in building technology, given our strategy to protect that constantly in the market. But also, of course, we need a better added value to also compensate for higher OpEx on one side, so that is why we also need a higher added value. On the other side, let's say the negative volumes have impact in the flex of costs. And therefore, let's say, although the teams did whatever they could to flex the cost at the maximum with a falling decline of minus 6.7% organically, we face, of course, also some drop down and that is resulting in the EBITA reduction of, let's say, 14% to 13%. But it would have been --\nMartijn den Drijver: Or translating that?\nArno Monincx: -- maybe even lower if we would not have had such a good added value, of course.\nStephane Simonetta: Then there is a timing issue to see the effect of our structural cost saving action that will come more in second half than in the first half.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay, that is good to know. Moving on to semicon, growth was substantially higher than I had anticipated at 10%. I think the guidance from Aalberts was roughly for the whole of 2024 mid-single digit. Is this guidance of mid-single digit still applicable for semicon for the whole of 2024, given the strong performance in the first half? And related to that, did the margin, the EBITA margin for semicon go up?\nStephane Simonetta: No change with our guidance, right? Because as we wrote and I think we mentioned, we continue to see a lot of volatile, up and down, especially in the short term. So long term, high confidence, still a growth agenda. There is a slight chance we may do better than our guidance, but the guidance is still the same because we have seen also some short term movement from our customers, so that's exactly what we were anticipating actually. Then on the margin?\nArno Monincx: The margin, I think also for semicon we were able to slightly improve margin also in the first six months versus last year.\nMartijn den Drijver: Got it. Got it. Then on the announcement of Capital Markets Day, 2024 is a difficult year. Is it a year that we could probably qualify as a transitional year? Why would you go for a Capital Markets Day, even though you're not even close to your strategic targets for 2026 and the agenda in terms of M&A and capital allocation is pretty clear as well? So what made you decide to go for Capital Markets Day?\nStephane Simonetta: Two reasons, like I mentioned, because the last one we did, it's now three years ago and a lot of things have changed in the last three years. And it's because also at the end of the year, before we enter ’25, we will be one year away for ’26. So we believe it's time to give an update of our strategy to all our stakeholders. That's the two main reasons.\nMartijn den Drijver: So it's only about strategy?\nStephane Simonetta: It's a strategic update that we plan to give.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay, but targets remain the same then?\nStephane Simonetta: We will share the update of our strategy and you understand that the strategy includes a lot of points. That's what we plan to do. I think I can only comment on what I said. As you know, in 2023, we were already on target with three of our indicators, getting close to the number four. And then we had two where we still have some work to do. So we will share the update in December of our strategy and the strategy includes the initiative and the target.\nMartijn den Drijver: Clear. Two final questions for Arno, if I may? There's €18 million in other income. What's included in that €18 million given that there is no gain on the divestments?\nArno Monincx: Now, first of all, what's actually the main difference with last year is an insurance income that we had because of the damage that we faced. So that is in the other operating income, the main difference versus last year. And as you may have seen also in the holding/eliminations line, we are still quite stable versus last year. So that also means that this, let's say, additional income, we have also allocated for more extraordinary spend. And like Stephane already mentioned, we have already started also a restructuring program and that is also where we allocated the cost to.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. So that's part for the course as to how Aalberts does it with these types of incidentals. I get it.\nArno Monincx: Yeah.\nMartijn den Drijver: And my final question on networking capital. Arno, what should we or what can we expect in terms of networking capital and specifically inventory towards the end of the year?\nArno Monincx: Yeah, let's say because what I believe is that maybe some have overseen the effect that we had, the positive income effect that we had in 2023, that there was not a normal because of the normal seasonality trend that you built up your stocks in the first half and you reduce your stocks in the second half. And I can tell you that although in days we are only slightly above last year, for the full year we still remain confident that we are able to improve our days working, and days in inventory outstanding also to the objective that we have set. We have a lot of initiatives ongoing and I'm still confident that we will do. And of course with a decreasing top line as we face it in the first half year, the days are a challenge but the trend is still good and maybe you have seen it, but we are lower than June last year. We are €16 million lower than June last year. So we will continue to optimize it also in the second half year.\nMartijn den Drijver: All right. Those were my questions. Thank you very much gentlemen.\nArno Monincx: Okay.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. I'd like to give the word now to Chase, no excuse me, to Elliot Robinson from Bank of America. Elliot, your line is open.\nElliott Robinson : Hi guys. Just three questions from me if that's okay and I'll try and take them one at a time. The first one is just, I was wondering if you could run us through any potential impact on yourselves if there were tariffs implemented in the US. So for example, what does your production versus sales footprint look like? That's my first one. Thank you.\nArno Monincx: Now let's say as you know, we have always the approach that we produce where we are also selling it. So we have a local approach. So I think Aalberts is especially in an area where we face tariffs by importing from other continents of the world. Yeah, I think Aalberts is well prepared for such trends because of the local footprints that we have and that we service.\nElliott Robinson : Okay. Nice one, thank you for that. The second bit was just on the net working capital. I suppose going back to that again. I suppose in H1, I suppose you would have thought with the organic decline, it could have come down maybe a little bit more than it did. I was just wondering what was kind of the moving parts within that on the net working capital and what gives you confidence on the fact that you think that you can reduce it further in H2. Obviously, there's the seasonality in that.\nArno Monincx: Let's say that's actually the biggest reason because the move in net working capital was negative versus a positive movement in the first half year of last year. And it clearly has to do with that in the first half of ’23, we reduced our stocks with €30 million coming from an extremely high DIO of 101 days. And now we increased our inventories for the season during the first half year. And in DIO, we are still very close to where we would like to be, although we are two days higher because of the also the lower top line, of course. But again, we remain confident that we will continue to reduce that further towards the end of the year.\nElliott Robinson : Sure. Just this one extra bit on that point. Is there any sort of split that you give on inventory by the business unit or anything like that? Or should we think almost higher capital intensity within certain parts of the business, for example?\nArno Monincx: Now, of course, the building is a big part, but also in our semicon business, we have also substantial inventories. The only area where we have less inventories is in surface technology business because there we perform a service to our customers. So there the inventories level are the lowest from the group.\nElliott Robinson : Right. Perfect. Thank you. And then my last one, if that's okay. And thank you for all the questions and for taking the time. You mentioned about data centers. I mean, could you just expand a little bit on maybe what your exposure is there and what you've kind of seen, I guess? Thank you.\nStephane Simonetta : Yeah, we see really an opportunity with our offering in our hydronic flow control portfolio to offer more prefab and skid systems to handle that also with our IPS portfolio. So the opportunity for us is to offer a complete system to address the heating and the cooling challenging of the data center, right? And the key is to offer a turnkey solution to our customers and also be able to help them in the design of the system before they do the building. So that also allows us to not only selling one of our components or products, but offer more services. So we are really investing a lot in terms of capabilities because we believe it will be a long-term growth driver. So a lot of things are done in the back end. Now the sales and the revenue, it's still very, very small, but we are preparing for the growth of this market over the coming years.\nElliott Robinson : Perfect. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Cheers.\nStephane Simonetta : Cheers.\nRutger Relker: Thanks. I think it's time for the next person. This is Christoph Greulich from Berenberg. Christoph, your line is open now.\nChristoph Greulich: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Three from my side, please. Firstly, on the added value margin, it looks to me like you've reached a record level here, at least what I can see in recent history. So just checking if this level will be sustainable going forward or if there have been any one-off effects in H1, like very fortunate timing of raw materials purchases or things like that, which have added to the added value margin in H1? Then the second one on the structural cost savings, which you have already mentioned, could you just give us a bit more color on the magnitude of savings in OpEx that we can expect going forward here? And then just the last one on the outlook for H2. So I hear in your statement that you expect construction marks in Europe to remain soft in H2 but just wondering if you compare it to what you've seen in H1, do you think it's going to get any worse or will it be more or less stable? Just asking because the comparable base in H2 will be a quite different one? And yeah, if you were to deliver the same revenue number as in H1, that would imply a return to growth in H2. So just checking what you're expecting here?\nArno Monincx: Yeah, let me first take the added value margin, where we faced improvements both in building and in industrial, although building was slightly higher improvement than in industrial. And in industrial, the added value margin is on a higher level because also with the previous question about stocks, we perform a service in surface technology, so there we have a reasonably high added value. And in advanced mechatronics, of course, we also have a material component, so there the added value is more at a normal level like we also perform in building. So let's say, yes, we are happy with the improvements and yes, that has also to do with, I think relatively, let's say the covered material that we have in our coverage of raw materials and then going forward with the pricing trends. And we believe it's sustainable, although improvement potential, of course, there is a limit to added value. There comes a moment that you cannot further improve anymore. But let's see how? I think also the mix says, so it's also depending on the mix of these two segments, how the development of added value will be going forward because, as I said, in the Industrial Technology segment, we have a relatively higher added value than in the Building Technology segment. And then maybe about the structural costs, you want to take that?\nStephane Simonetta : Yeah, yeah, I think just on added value, I would add that fantastic job by our teams in such a challenging market, because we never compromise on price. But and we, of course, in some product lines, there is more competition with the price pressure, but that's where we don't go at all costs just for volume, and that's why we are able to sustain such a good performance. On the structural costs, you can imagine, actually, we are taking action. First of all, executing what we plan, because we were expecting a soft market in buildings, so a lot of it is already in progress. And that's why we expect some impact already in the second half, especially in building technology. And this [indiscernible]. So really, reducing fixed costs, like I always say, we need now to do more of the same with less. But and then in 2025, we will have a better fixed cost to the building technology. And it's a mix of footprint of fixed costs that we are doing, mostly in our building technology. We are still adjusting in industrial technology, but most of the restructuring costs and OpEx are on the building technology side.\nChristoph Greulich: And the outlook?\nStephane Simonetta : And the outlook, we see actually a flat compared to first half, because as I mentioned, the stocks are already very low on building technology, and we believe they will stay there. So we don't expect an increase in building regarding the inventory. And then in the industry, we follow our customers, so that's not where it's a major challenge. So that's why second half, with a flat volume and additional cost-saving impact, that's a bit what we expect in the second half.\nChristoph Greulich: Yes, very clear, thank you.\nRutger Relker: Okay, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Yes, it's Luuk van Beek from Degroof Petercam. Good morning, Luuk, your line is open now.\nLuuk van Beek: Yes, good morning. I have two remaining questions. One is on the US commercial valves. Can you elaborate on the actions that you've taken to improve your service levels and what's happening there? And the second is if you can give an indication of how you see the impact of raw materials going forward. We saw a strong spike in the copper price, for example, in recent months then it came down. Do you expect any significant impact from that in H2?\nStephane Simonetta : Thank you, Luuk. So yes, commercial valves, it's all about service levels based on some operational challenges we have internally, so we are improving, we had a very strong June and that's what we expect to continue. So the growth is there, the order book is there, we just need to do even a better job and continue the improvement to get more product out of the door. So one hand is to get back to the service level we need for our customers, and we believe. When we will get there, there are more growth opportunities for 2025. So ’24 is to get back on track and to the service level for our customers. And then let's see in ’25 if we can actually start to win. So exciting opportunity, but the market is there and it's up to us to get it.\nArno Monincx: Yeah, then for the raw material, as you know Luuk, we are covered with our material for four to seven months ahead. So that gives us always the view how we should anticipate with pricing towards the trends of raw materials. And it looks like, as it looks right now, because the trend is also upward in raw material pricing, that probably in the beginning of next year, we will do some pricing initiatives again to compensate for that. But that is to be seen, of course, in the remainder of this year. But that is how it looks like today. And we will see how the trends will be affected in the second half of the year. But we are always ahead of the game there, because we are covering our materials ahead. So that is just a positive thing.\nLuuk van Beek: Okay, thank you.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Luuk. I think there's another person. It's Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen. Good morning, Chase. Your line is open.\nChase Coughlan: Good morning, all. Thank you for taking my questions. Apologies, I had some technical difficulties earlier. So I'm not sure if I've -- I missed the question already. But we've obviously spoken quite a lot today about the raw material price inflation and how you pass that on successfully improving the added value margin. I'm just curious on if you look for that building technology space, what exactly are your competitors doing actually? Is there a risk that some players are not raising prices and could potentially undercut you? And effectively gaining market share and having you lose market share? Is that a risk that you see happening at the moment?\nStephane Simonetta : There is always a risk that people will sacrifice their price to get volume and get deals, right? But that's not our strategy. And that's what we have been doing very well. And of course, that's where innovation matters. And I'm super pleased to see on some product line, we have been doing better than the market on building technology because our offering is unique, because we have better product and better availability also. And that's the best way and where we see the biggest pressure on price is where there is less innovative solution, right? And this is some time where we are not afraid to just let it go. And because also it's where we have also lower margin, so where there is the highest pressure on cost is actually not a risk for us.\nChase Coughlan: Okay, that's very clear. And then just one final question from my side, you also spoke quite a lot in the presentation about acquisitions, potentially some bolt-ons in the US. Could you potentially give us sort of a more indication on size here or even on a timeline in terms of when we should expect a deal to come through? Is that something that we could expect in the second half of ’24 or even going more into 2025? Any more color there, please?\nStephane Simonetta : We have a strong funnel that we are working on, on our three priorities, like I mentioned. So we expect to make progress in the short mid-term on this. And the bolt-on is as per our current strategy when we reported in the last Capital Market Day in 2021.\nChase Coughlan: Yeah.\nStephane Simonetta : With the areas of America, hydrolic flow control and advanced mechatronics or in the US and maybe also in Southeast Asia for advanced mechatronics.\nChase Coughlan: Yeah. Okay, very clear. Thank you, gentlemen.\nStephane Simonetta : Thank you.\nRutger Relker: Thank you all. We have received some questions which have been submitted via the Q&A form. And I'd like to start with this one. Yeah, this is a question whether we could repeat or give perhaps even a bit more clarity about what we said about cost reductions being more visible in the second half versus the first half. And as a result, follow-up question, can we also see margin evolving even better?\nArno Monincx: What we can say about that is that we have, as Stephane I think also explained, we have already started a lot of, let's say, structural reduction actions. So reduction of structural cost actions. We have started a lot of that. I just explained some of these costs are already taken in the first half year, which also, let's say, was for the holding/eliminations cost to be more or less flat versus last year because the income from the insurers we also allocated to that part of improving the business. And we expect more to come in the second half year. And that will also then give the benefits in the second half of the year of these structural cost improvements.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Arno. There's another question.\nArno Monincx: And even more important is that it's also really improving our basis for [2015] because then we have the full year benefit.\nStephane Simonetta : I think we have seen that we are able to flex all our variable costs and actually improve. So most of the action we are taking now is to address, of course, some short-term volatile demand but also prepare for the long term, having a lower fixed cost base. So when the rebound of activity will come, we'll be even better prepared to continue our margin expansions.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. There's another question which probably has been answered already, but let's repeat it because apparently it's an important question. Again, about what growth trends could we expect building tech and industrial tech in the second half of this year?\nStephane Simonetta : I think we can repeat. So soft demand we expect will continue, so more second half similar to the first half on the building tech. And a bit the same on the industrial tech because we see mixed demand. So that's what we expect.\nArno Monincx: But just to remind you that last year the second half also was weaker than the first half organically. So from a comparison base it might be a little bit easier.\nRutger Relker: Yeah, okay, thank you. Stephane, there's another question for you. Specifically, how do you make progress on your observations after your onboarding?\nStephane Simonetta : Yes, thank you for asking. I'm pleased to say that we are making good progress and actually now we are more in action mode based on some of my first observations, right? So continuing to invest and accelerating on all our people and culture agenda as we just welcome also a new member in our executive team. So it's also preparing for the future, having the right leadership, talent development, diversity. So this is well in progress. The second point was operational excellence. So we continue what we have been doing but now we are even investing more to become leaner and faster, to improve our service level, reduce our inventory and also optimize our CapEx. So a lot is put on the machine utilization, better maintenance and we are adding a lot of capabilities to drive that, also preparing for the long term. And on technology and innovation also, especially in building technology, we are working also on some initiatives to prepare and work on some innovative solutions to offer more than product and offer solutions to our customers in both residential and commercial buildings. So that's some of the things we accelerated in the second half, preparing for the long term, so no short term impact but preparing the long term.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, there's another question also for you Stephane. Can you explain again, what do you mean with portfolio optimization?\nStephane Simonetta : Yeah, I think it's a good one. It's one of our four strategic actions. So portfolio acquisition is to, and that's something which we will always do, right? Internally or externally, right? I think we always need to optimize our portfolio to make sure it's a portfolio where the market is growing, where we can have a good position, where we can be in the leading position and where we can make good margin in a sustainable way. That go back to Aalbert's DNA, sustainable and profitable. So what it means now on one hand is to do acquisitions, so that's what we are working on. And then what it means is divestment, based on an internal portfolio where we believe we are not the best owner. If there is lack of synergies or we believe there is a better owner than us that can invest in this business, we will simply divest it. And so that's what I mean for portfolio optimization.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Stephane. I think I have no further questions now coming in. So I think that we can conclude today's webcast. So, first of all, I would like to thank each of you for your participation. I hope today's presentation has provided you with a clear understanding of our achievements, our financial health and once again confirmed our strategic direction going forward. Thank you once again for joining us today. Good day.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you.\nA - Arno Monincx: Thank you.",

      "transcript": "Rutger Relker: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. It is my pleasure to welcome you to Aalberts First Half 2024. My name is Rutger Relker, Director, Investor Relations. This morning we published our interim results. We delivered a 15% EBITA margin in challenging markets. Together with our CEO, Stephane Simonetta and our CFO, Arno Monincx, we will look back to the first half of 2024 and we will look forward to the second half 2024. Stephane will kick off the presentation with some key highlights. This will be followed by Arno who will give a financial update. Stephane will then share our strategic priorities and outlook. After the presentation we will give you the opportunity to engage directly with us in the Q&A session. Your questions and feedback are very important to us and we encourage you to participate. Later today we will make both the presentation and the recording of this webcast available on our website. Please welcome Stephane Simonetta to begin our presentation.\nStephane Simonetta : Thank you, Rutger. Good morning, everyone. So the first six months of the year have been challenging as we saw lower activity at our customers, especially at wins in building technology. But we have improved, thanks to the work of our teams, to improve our added value margins and we improve our profitability in our Industrial Technology segment. As a whole, we are delivering 15% EBITA margin, thanks to our cost saving and robust price level. And as you see on this slide, that are the key highlights about our first half performance with an organic growth at minus 3.9%, with an EBITA at 15% of €242 million, and an added value at 63.8%, which has improved as Arno will explain later, in both actually of segment compared to last year. As we always do, we are adjusting our costs, especially fixed costs thanks to our structural cost saving. And you can imagine that most of the cost savings are on our Building Technology segment and we are deploying and executing our inventory reduction plan to be back on track at the end of the year. Despite the short-term challenges, we continue to invest for the long term and that's why our CapEx is in plan with last year. We deliver an EPS at €1.61 and we continue to deploy our four strategic actions. I'll give you more color later on. So overall, we continue to execute our strategy. We have delivered 15% EBITA and we are well positioned for the rebound of the activity. When you look at the operational development, let me give you a bit of color for each of our end markets. And starting with building technology, our eco-friendly buildings, this is where we see lower activity in Europe, especially in Germany. But despite all these challenges, our added value margin has improved in our eco-friendly building, thanks to our robust pricing, our sales initiative and our purchasing actions. We continue to see a decreasing lower end-user demand in new builds and softer demand in renovation. As expected, the stock level at our wholesaler were still low, but we continue to see better activity in Americas, in Asia and in some product lines, we are actually doing better than the market. As an example, our grooved technologies, our water treatment offering, our pressurization and storage tank, our safety and efficiency valve are actually doing better than the market, which means we are winning some shares compared to the market trends. In the US, we are still working to improve our service level and this is where we are expecting a better second half on our commercial valve. And we see the positive trend on some new verticals, especially the data center, where we are also working on offering an innovative solution for our customers. Despite this short-term volatile demand, long-term it remains a growth agenda because the energy, the resource efficiency, in both residential and commercial buildings, they remain long-term growth drivers. But as you have seen, this is mostly in this vertical that we see the biggest challenge. Because on the other hand, everything linked to our industrial technology is actually doing much better and semiconductor efficiency continues to grow. Despite some short-term volatile demand, we are improving our service and our order book remains at a high level. And we continue to see very strong demand on our advanced mechatronics module with more and more system integration, especially as you all know for our lithography and inspection application. We see more and more, which is good news for our sustainability agenda, need for refurbishment from our customers. And this is a growth enabler on top of the technology trend. And we are continuing to invest for the long-term, because we need more capacity to serve and deliver the growth from our customers. So very confident and we expect a much stronger ’25 in this industry because there is positive technology trend like AI technology that will bring additional demand. In sustainable transportation, we have once again, this just shows our resilience, a very solid performance, and because also here we see a mixed demand with lower in automotive but continued growth in aerospace. So we are, I think, delivering as usual and flexing our costs to sustain some solid margins. And that's why we are able to follow the trend, especially in automotive. And we continue to see high growth for the high precision manufacturing parts, especially also some good opportunity on surface technology, because there is more and more need for lightweight material. And we are also continuing here to support the e-mobility agenda, sustainability and all the reshoring continue to be growth driver in this end market. Industrial niche, a bit more challenge because of course here it's following the overall economy and we see some lower demand, especially in West Europe. Once again, also the Germany is more challenging with overall industrial need going down. Also US, and we continue to see growth in Asia. So we are adjusting our costs, but the order intake continue to be very strong on the other hand in the US for industrial value and that's why we expect also a second half to be better and we still see growth opportunity. That's what we are working on, to capture a growth and win share in North America on our industrial value. So in a nutshell, that's where we have been doing on the first half with very strong picture on industrial where we are able to continue the growth on semicon, more stability on sustainable transportation and more challenging on industry. And then we are taking all the measure to secure our margins on eco-friendly buildings. Let me now hand you over to Arno. Arno?\nArno Monincx : Yeah, thank you, Stephane. Good morning everybody also from my side. I would like to take you through the financial development of Aalberts, over the first half of 2024. Starting with the revenue where you see the decline of 3.9% organically over the first six months versus last year and where we see the headwind in building, as Stephane also explained, ending up in 6.7% organic decline for building technology; and then industrial, a reasonably flat situation, minus 0.4% which is actually given the market circumstances also in industrial, quite a strong performance. In total it's minus 3.9%. And the EBITA margin, there we sustained a good added value. We even improved our added value as Stephane said, with 1.5%, which is a great result and a great performance of the teams and that is clearly always our strategy that we really protect our added value margin because there it all begins with the earnings of course. So there we are still with 63.8% at a very good level and that is also one of the reasons that we could at least keep our profitability to the level of 50.0% although it's a decline of 0.4% but still 50.0% in challenging market situations. The earnings per share before the amortization, let's say the net profit before the amortization ended up at €178 million and also there we see that the net finance costs were clearly lower than last year but that is also a positive thing and that also helps to at least have €1.61 per share as an EPS versus the €1.71 last year. Then the cash flow from operations where we decreased from €221 million in the first half of ’23 to €182 million in the first half of ’24 and we have also put here the two main reasons for that. First of all, of course a lower EBITA level, a €16 million effect to this operational cash flow and the other one is the network capital move of, let's say, which was €27 million lower than the move last year. And that clearly has to do with the normal seasonality trend that you build up stock in the first half year and you reduce your stocks in the second half year. Also because of the seasonality and where we had the situation in the first half of ’23 as we came from a very high stock level in ’22, at the end of ’22 due to all the supply chain issues as you may remember. So that was clearly let's say a positive situation for the cash flow in the first half of ’23. But this gives more or less the normal seasonality. Then the revenue per end market, where we see eco-friendly builds with 51% actually quite stable, semicon efficiency continued to increase in the share of the total towards 15%, sustainable transportation also slight increase to 17% and here we see the industrial niches are really reducing towards the 17%, coming from 19%, full year ’23. The revenue per region, I must say quite stable, actually there's not a lot of change. The only thing is that APAC, Middle East, Africa is 1% lower than full year ’23 and Western Europe is 1% higher than full year ’23. The revenue bridge, coming from the first half of ’23, €1.717 billion, then we have no effect from acquisitions in the first half of ’24. The net effect of the disposals, the divestments versus 2023 was €37.3 million with the loss of revenues that had to do of course with the divestment of Disptek. Currency effect, the small plus €3.8 million mainly impacted by Great British pound and Polish zloty and then it results in the organic revenue decline of €64.8 million, again the 3.9% as explained earlier and that is totalizing towards the €1.618 billion we realized over the first half of ’24. The same for the EBITA bridge where we started from €264.2 million over the first half of ’23, no effects from acquisitions, we lost €4.9 million versus last year due to the divestment of Disptek we did in ’23, and then we had a slight positive translation impact mainly again Great British pounds and Polish zloty of €0.4 million. And that results in the organic EBITA decline of €17.5 million of EBITA lost and that is as said earlier, mainly realized in building technology driven by lower volume where we saw the margins going down from 14.0% to 13.0%. I will explain in the next slides also and where we still see that Industrial Technology improved the EBITA margin but also come back to that in the next slide. The Building Technology segment revenue came down from €932 million to the €873 million in the first half which was the 6.7% organic decline versus the minus 1.5% decline we faced in the first half of ’23. The added value improved, thanks to robust pricing also mentioned by Stephane, sales initiatives and purchasing actions and we believe that our teams also in this difficult market circumstances did a great job to protect their added value. And that at the end helped a lot to sustain the EBITA margin to the 13.0% that we reported versus the 14.0% last year. And let's say also here we see that the capital expenditure we continue to invest despite difficult market circumstances. So that's also, yeah we are we are still investing for the long term of course because we believe that the long term perspective also for building is still positive. Last but not least, America and APAC we saw better activity than in Europe. Then the Industrial Technology segment, also a slight decrease of revenues from €785 million to €746 million which organically was let's say only minus 0.4% because also here of course we faced the disposal of Disptek. And don't forget that last year the first half of ’23 we really had a very strong organic growth performance in Industrial Technology of plus 16%. Then the EBITA margin, despite the lower volume we managed to improve our EBITA margin and there the teams really did a great job to flex their costs also with slightly lower volumes to even be able to improve EBITA margin to this good performance of 17.8% in the first half. Also here we continue to invest although the CapEx is slightly lower, that is related to the timing because also in Industrial Technology segment we will continue to invest for the long term. And again, continued growth in semicon efficiency, a stable activity in sustainable transportation, and a lower activity in the industrial niches that is the takeaway from the three end markets. Then the two segments divided geographically from their revenues, we see 54% Western European building technology which is a little bit higher in the total than the full year and for the rest, I would say there's not so much change. Also in the Industrial Technology segment it's only slight changes Eastern Europe but for the rest -- Eastern Europe is a little bit lower than last year, for the rest it's more or less the same. Stephane, back to you.\nStephane Simonetta : Thank you, Arno. So when we talk about strategy deployment, as you know we have our six KPIs where we made a great progress last year and we continue to work on this one. And as you know in 2023 we were at the ’26 target on SDG, on innovation rate, on leverage ratio, getting close on EBITA margin and continuing the improvement on ROCE and then with some way to go still on organic growth. So we continue to work on this six KPI in ’24 and let me report now some progress on our four strategic actions and the first one is our portfolio optimization. Like we mentioned also in our full year results presentation, it's both acquisition and divestment. So on the acquisition side no change, we continue to prioritize three areas where we want to grow inorganically. In hydronic flow control which is still a mix between new technologies that we want to add in our portfolio, but also in the USA. In advanced mechatronics, which is also a mix between new technologies in our portfolio, but also looking at the Southeast Asia footprint and USA, as I mentioned before, but also looking at some of the bolt-on acquisition on surface technologies. In divestments, we continue to look at our portfolio and we will divest when we believe we are not the best owner on some of our businesses, as we have done in the past. The organic growth, really, and trying to continue the growth in the US, in Asia, to have also a more geographical balance overall and growing, thanks to our innovation. And we see that this is where we have been able in the first half to have some growth in some niche, thanks to innovative solutions in our eco-friendly building, thanks to the, of course, semicon efficiency trend, but also in aerospace. And that's also what we want to continue to increase our innovation power. And we continue, and because it's also geographical expansion, in Mexico for surface technology and in the Netherlands, also for semicon efficiency and some eco-friendly building, where we have also had some extra capacity to support the sustainability agenda in Europe. Operational excellence, I think the first half is a good example of what it means, right? Thanks to the great job of our pricing excellence, that's what also always means, right? When there is more stable volume, how can you do better? And so that's what we have been doing in the first half. Pricing excellence, structural cost reduction, and footprint optimization, we continue, and of course, we will make some progress in ’24 towards our ’26 goal. And we are accelerating, continuing the continuous improvement, especially in the business and where we have more operational challenge, not only to reduce costs, but also to improve service level and reduce our inventories, right? That’s operational excellence. And you can imagine that we have a lot of prioritization in our Building Technology segment to address these challenges. But let's not forget something also very important to us, that we continue to drive our sustainability initiative, improving our health and safety for all our employees. We make some good progress in the first half, and we continue, and also preparing next year annual report as per the CSRD regulation, and we are preparing everything, working on circular economy together with our customers. So overall, continuing to make progress on the whole ESG agenda with all the KPI and the initiative we are working on. So we expect to report some good progress also next year in our next annual report. So when you look at the outlook, all more especially the second half, right? So what do we expect for the second half? First of all, we expect the soft market in eco-friendly buildings to continue, especially in Europe, and we continue to see opportunity to grow, to do better in the US and in Asia. On the other hand, on Industrial Technology, we still remain confident for the long term with a semicon growth agenda and industry more a mixed picture, as I mentioned, between aerospace, automotive, more stable, so different by technology, by regions, and also by end market. Portfolio optimization, we continue to stay disciplined in our capital allocation, so doing CapEx, but also ready to make some bolt-on acquisition and optimize our portfolio. So we continue to make good progress here. And as I mentioned, we will continue to provide more transparency, especially on our scope 3 emission, more upstream in our value chain to also make progress in this area. So overall, we remain very well positioned for the rebound of the activity, thanks to the deployment of our initiative, thanks to the restructuring costs we took, and thanks to the market trend, as we have been doing in the first half. The outlook is not changing and we are still in deployment mode in 2024 with our four strategic actions, that's what I mentioned at the beginning, so organic growth, operational excellence, portfolio optimization, and sustainable entrepreneurship. But what we are planning at the end of the year is a new Capital Market Day that we will do on the 10th December, and because I think it's after three years, it is time to give an update on our strategy, and also because 2026 is getting closer, so we have decided to give to all of you and to all our stakeholders an update on our strategy at the end of 2024. That's all I wanted to share with you, and let me back and hand it over to Rutger. Thank you very much.\nA - Rutger Relker: Thank you, Arno and Stephane. As we are starting the Q&A session, I’d like to remind everyone how to participate. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to give the word to David Kerstens from Jefferies for the first questions.\nDavid Kerstens : Yes, good morning. Thank you very much, Rutger. I've got three questions, please. First of all, can you explain the deterioration in organic revenues in the months May and June? I think minus 5% in industrial tech and 8% in building tech, particularly in industrial tech, notably weaker than in the first four months of the year. And then maybe the second question, what is the impact of weakening incentives to move towards heat pumps? I think the new Dutch government wants to abolish the mandatory change towards heat pumps. Maybe we can keep gas boilers from 2026. I think previously you talked about the positive impact from replacing 65 million gas boilers in Europe. What will be the impact if we can still keep gas boilers? And then maybe finally, do you see some signs of inventory restocking already in the second half of the year ahead of the expected recovery in demand later this year? Thank you very much.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you. Good and great question. So the industrial technology, it's very tactical and short term, like you mentioned, because I think many of our customers, especially in the German market and in our surface treatment, have been managing their half-year results and basically stopping and postponing a lot of their services from June to the second half. So that's why the June months, so it's a very short term issue, they have been optimizing and postponing things to the second half. That's why the June months have been more challenging on industrial technologies. The second point is, you are right, I think we see it, the stock remains very high at our customers on heat pumps and they are really struggling to get that out of their doors because they are less and less incentive by the government. But for us, it's actually, I would say, more neutral because we are still using expansion vessels when you need gas boilers and actually we see a unique growth. You may have seen in our operational update that we are winning shares and we are doing better than the market trend on expansion vessels because you need more units on gas boilers than on heat pumps and then the installer can do more jobs to install gas boilers than to do heat pumps. So I would say it's a neutral but if you look at the unit, it's slightly positive for us when you see this trend. And the third point, I think here also talking to our customers I’ve been visiting, we are more cautious that the stock will continue to remain very low, right? Because that's what we see from our customers, so we expect and continue to see soft demand in the second half and we are not expecting a huge restocking before next year.\nDavid Kerstens : Okay, that’s clear, thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, David. Martijn, are you there?\nStephane Simonetta: I think he's not there.\nRutger Relker: No, apparently not.\nMartijn den Drijver: No, no, I am.\nRutger Relker: Ah, you are. Okay, sorry. Good morning.\nMartijn den Drijver: I am. Can you hear me now, guys?\nRutger Relker: Yes. I can hear you.\nMartijn den Drijver: Good. I apologize, I couldn't hear you. Okay, everything's fine, at least in terms of audio. My first question would be about building technology. You mentioned that the value add was up also for building technology, but your EBITA margin is down. Normally, I would expect if your value add goes up, that your EBITA would go up. So what's driving, despite that better value add, that decline in EBITA margin for building tech? That's question one and I'll do them one by one.\nArno Monincx: Okay, let me take that question, Martijn. Yes, we are quite, let's say, happy with the added value developments that we realized in building technology, given our strategy to protect that constantly in the market. But also, of course, we need a better added value to also compensate for higher OpEx on one side, so that is why we also need a higher added value. On the other side, let's say the negative volumes have impact in the flex of costs. And therefore, let's say, although the teams did whatever they could to flex the cost at the maximum with a falling decline of minus 6.7% organically, we face, of course, also some drop down and that is resulting in the EBITA reduction of, let's say, 14% to 13%. But it would have been --\nMartijn den Drijver: Or translating that?\nArno Monincx: -- maybe even lower if we would not have had such a good added value, of course.\nStephane Simonetta: Then there is a timing issue to see the effect of our structural cost saving action that will come more in second half than in the first half.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay, that is good to know. Moving on to semicon, growth was substantially higher than I had anticipated at 10%. I think the guidance from Aalberts was roughly for the whole of 2024 mid-single digit. Is this guidance of mid-single digit still applicable for semicon for the whole of 2024, given the strong performance in the first half? And related to that, did the margin, the EBITA margin for semicon go up?\nStephane Simonetta: No change with our guidance, right? Because as we wrote and I think we mentioned, we continue to see a lot of volatile, up and down, especially in the short term. So long term, high confidence, still a growth agenda. There is a slight chance we may do better than our guidance, but the guidance is still the same because we have seen also some short term movement from our customers, so that's exactly what we were anticipating actually. Then on the margin?\nArno Monincx: The margin, I think also for semicon we were able to slightly improve margin also in the first six months versus last year.\nMartijn den Drijver: Got it. Got it. Then on the announcement of Capital Markets Day, 2024 is a difficult year. Is it a year that we could probably qualify as a transitional year? Why would you go for a Capital Markets Day, even though you're not even close to your strategic targets for 2026 and the agenda in terms of M&A and capital allocation is pretty clear as well? So what made you decide to go for Capital Markets Day?\nStephane Simonetta: Two reasons, like I mentioned, because the last one we did, it's now three years ago and a lot of things have changed in the last three years. And it's because also at the end of the year, before we enter ’25, we will be one year away for ’26. So we believe it's time to give an update of our strategy to all our stakeholders. That's the two main reasons.\nMartijn den Drijver: So it's only about strategy?\nStephane Simonetta: It's a strategic update that we plan to give.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay, but targets remain the same then?\nStephane Simonetta: We will share the update of our strategy and you understand that the strategy includes a lot of points. That's what we plan to do. I think I can only comment on what I said. As you know, in 2023, we were already on target with three of our indicators, getting close to the number four. And then we had two where we still have some work to do. So we will share the update in December of our strategy and the strategy includes the initiative and the target.\nMartijn den Drijver: Clear. Two final questions for Arno, if I may? There's €18 million in other income. What's included in that €18 million given that there is no gain on the divestments?\nArno Monincx: Now, first of all, what's actually the main difference with last year is an insurance income that we had because of the damage that we faced. So that is in the other operating income, the main difference versus last year. And as you may have seen also in the holding/eliminations line, we are still quite stable versus last year. So that also means that this, let's say, additional income, we have also allocated for more extraordinary spend. And like Stephane already mentioned, we have already started also a restructuring program and that is also where we allocated the cost to.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. So that's part for the course as to how Aalberts does it with these types of incidentals. I get it.\nArno Monincx: Yeah.\nMartijn den Drijver: And my final question on networking capital. Arno, what should we or what can we expect in terms of networking capital and specifically inventory towards the end of the year?\nArno Monincx: Yeah, let's say because what I believe is that maybe some have overseen the effect that we had, the positive income effect that we had in 2023, that there was not a normal because of the normal seasonality trend that you built up your stocks in the first half and you reduce your stocks in the second half. And I can tell you that although in days we are only slightly above last year, for the full year we still remain confident that we are able to improve our days working, and days in inventory outstanding also to the objective that we have set. We have a lot of initiatives ongoing and I'm still confident that we will do. And of course with a decreasing top line as we face it in the first half year, the days are a challenge but the trend is still good and maybe you have seen it, but we are lower than June last year. We are €16 million lower than June last year. So we will continue to optimize it also in the second half year.\nMartijn den Drijver: All right. Those were my questions. Thank you very much gentlemen.\nArno Monincx: Okay.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. I'd like to give the word now to Chase, no excuse me, to Elliot Robinson from Bank of America. Elliot, your line is open.\nElliott Robinson : Hi guys. Just three questions from me if that's okay and I'll try and take them one at a time. The first one is just, I was wondering if you could run us through any potential impact on yourselves if there were tariffs implemented in the US. So for example, what does your production versus sales footprint look like? That's my first one. Thank you.\nArno Monincx: Now let's say as you know, we have always the approach that we produce where we are also selling it. So we have a local approach. So I think Aalberts is especially in an area where we face tariffs by importing from other continents of the world. Yeah, I think Aalberts is well prepared for such trends because of the local footprints that we have and that we service.\nElliott Robinson : Okay. Nice one, thank you for that. The second bit was just on the net working capital. I suppose going back to that again. I suppose in H1, I suppose you would have thought with the organic decline, it could have come down maybe a little bit more than it did. I was just wondering what was kind of the moving parts within that on the net working capital and what gives you confidence on the fact that you think that you can reduce it further in H2. Obviously, there's the seasonality in that.\nArno Monincx: Let's say that's actually the biggest reason because the move in net working capital was negative versus a positive movement in the first half year of last year. And it clearly has to do with that in the first half of ’23, we reduced our stocks with €30 million coming from an extremely high DIO of 101 days. And now we increased our inventories for the season during the first half year. And in DIO, we are still very close to where we would like to be, although we are two days higher because of the also the lower top line, of course. But again, we remain confident that we will continue to reduce that further towards the end of the year.\nElliott Robinson : Sure. Just this one extra bit on that point. Is there any sort of split that you give on inventory by the business unit or anything like that? Or should we think almost higher capital intensity within certain parts of the business, for example?\nArno Monincx: Now, of course, the building is a big part, but also in our semicon business, we have also substantial inventories. The only area where we have less inventories is in surface technology business because there we perform a service to our customers. So there the inventories level are the lowest from the group.\nElliott Robinson : Right. Perfect. Thank you. And then my last one, if that's okay. And thank you for all the questions and for taking the time. You mentioned about data centers. I mean, could you just expand a little bit on maybe what your exposure is there and what you've kind of seen, I guess? Thank you.\nStephane Simonetta : Yeah, we see really an opportunity with our offering in our hydronic flow control portfolio to offer more prefab and skid systems to handle that also with our IPS portfolio. So the opportunity for us is to offer a complete system to address the heating and the cooling challenging of the data center, right? And the key is to offer a turnkey solution to our customers and also be able to help them in the design of the system before they do the building. So that also allows us to not only selling one of our components or products, but offer more services. So we are really investing a lot in terms of capabilities because we believe it will be a long-term growth driver. So a lot of things are done in the back end. Now the sales and the revenue, it's still very, very small, but we are preparing for the growth of this market over the coming years.\nElliott Robinson : Perfect. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Cheers.\nStephane Simonetta : Cheers.\nRutger Relker: Thanks. I think it's time for the next person. This is Christoph Greulich from Berenberg. Christoph, your line is open now.\nChristoph Greulich: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Three from my side, please. Firstly, on the added value margin, it looks to me like you've reached a record level here, at least what I can see in recent history. So just checking if this level will be sustainable going forward or if there have been any one-off effects in H1, like very fortunate timing of raw materials purchases or things like that, which have added to the added value margin in H1? Then the second one on the structural cost savings, which you have already mentioned, could you just give us a bit more color on the magnitude of savings in OpEx that we can expect going forward here? And then just the last one on the outlook for H2. So I hear in your statement that you expect construction marks in Europe to remain soft in H2 but just wondering if you compare it to what you've seen in H1, do you think it's going to get any worse or will it be more or less stable? Just asking because the comparable base in H2 will be a quite different one? And yeah, if you were to deliver the same revenue number as in H1, that would imply a return to growth in H2. So just checking what you're expecting here?\nArno Monincx: Yeah, let me first take the added value margin, where we faced improvements both in building and in industrial, although building was slightly higher improvement than in industrial. And in industrial, the added value margin is on a higher level because also with the previous question about stocks, we perform a service in surface technology, so there we have a reasonably high added value. And in advanced mechatronics, of course, we also have a material component, so there the added value is more at a normal level like we also perform in building. So let's say, yes, we are happy with the improvements and yes, that has also to do with, I think relatively, let's say the covered material that we have in our coverage of raw materials and then going forward with the pricing trends. And we believe it's sustainable, although improvement potential, of course, there is a limit to added value. There comes a moment that you cannot further improve anymore. But let's see how? I think also the mix says, so it's also depending on the mix of these two segments, how the development of added value will be going forward because, as I said, in the Industrial Technology segment, we have a relatively higher added value than in the Building Technology segment. And then maybe about the structural costs, you want to take that?\nStephane Simonetta : Yeah, yeah, I think just on added value, I would add that fantastic job by our teams in such a challenging market, because we never compromise on price. But and we, of course, in some product lines, there is more competition with the price pressure, but that's where we don't go at all costs just for volume, and that's why we are able to sustain such a good performance. On the structural costs, you can imagine, actually, we are taking action. First of all, executing what we plan, because we were expecting a soft market in buildings, so a lot of it is already in progress. And that's why we expect some impact already in the second half, especially in building technology. And this [indiscernible]. So really, reducing fixed costs, like I always say, we need now to do more of the same with less. But and then in 2025, we will have a better fixed cost to the building technology. And it's a mix of footprint of fixed costs that we are doing, mostly in our building technology. We are still adjusting in industrial technology, but most of the restructuring costs and OpEx are on the building technology side.\nChristoph Greulich: And the outlook?\nStephane Simonetta : And the outlook, we see actually a flat compared to first half, because as I mentioned, the stocks are already very low on building technology, and we believe they will stay there. So we don't expect an increase in building regarding the inventory. And then in the industry, we follow our customers, so that's not where it's a major challenge. So that's why second half, with a flat volume and additional cost-saving impact, that's a bit what we expect in the second half.\nChristoph Greulich: Yes, very clear, thank you.\nRutger Relker: Okay, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Yes, it's Luuk van Beek from Degroof Petercam. Good morning, Luuk, your line is open now.\nLuuk van Beek: Yes, good morning. I have two remaining questions. One is on the US commercial valves. Can you elaborate on the actions that you've taken to improve your service levels and what's happening there? And the second is if you can give an indication of how you see the impact of raw materials going forward. We saw a strong spike in the copper price, for example, in recent months then it came down. Do you expect any significant impact from that in H2?\nStephane Simonetta : Thank you, Luuk. So yes, commercial valves, it's all about service levels based on some operational challenges we have internally, so we are improving, we had a very strong June and that's what we expect to continue. So the growth is there, the order book is there, we just need to do even a better job and continue the improvement to get more product out of the door. So one hand is to get back to the service level we need for our customers, and we believe. When we will get there, there are more growth opportunities for 2025. So ’24 is to get back on track and to the service level for our customers. And then let's see in ’25 if we can actually start to win. So exciting opportunity, but the market is there and it's up to us to get it.\nArno Monincx: Yeah, then for the raw material, as you know Luuk, we are covered with our material for four to seven months ahead. So that gives us always the view how we should anticipate with pricing towards the trends of raw materials. And it looks like, as it looks right now, because the trend is also upward in raw material pricing, that probably in the beginning of next year, we will do some pricing initiatives again to compensate for that. But that is to be seen, of course, in the remainder of this year. But that is how it looks like today. And we will see how the trends will be affected in the second half of the year. But we are always ahead of the game there, because we are covering our materials ahead. So that is just a positive thing.\nLuuk van Beek: Okay, thank you.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Luuk. I think there's another person. It's Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen. Good morning, Chase. Your line is open.\nChase Coughlan: Good morning, all. Thank you for taking my questions. Apologies, I had some technical difficulties earlier. So I'm not sure if I've -- I missed the question already. But we've obviously spoken quite a lot today about the raw material price inflation and how you pass that on successfully improving the added value margin. I'm just curious on if you look for that building technology space, what exactly are your competitors doing actually? Is there a risk that some players are not raising prices and could potentially undercut you? And effectively gaining market share and having you lose market share? Is that a risk that you see happening at the moment?\nStephane Simonetta : There is always a risk that people will sacrifice their price to get volume and get deals, right? But that's not our strategy. And that's what we have been doing very well. And of course, that's where innovation matters. And I'm super pleased to see on some product line, we have been doing better than the market on building technology because our offering is unique, because we have better product and better availability also. And that's the best way and where we see the biggest pressure on price is where there is less innovative solution, right? And this is some time where we are not afraid to just let it go. And because also it's where we have also lower margin, so where there is the highest pressure on cost is actually not a risk for us.\nChase Coughlan: Okay, that's very clear. And then just one final question from my side, you also spoke quite a lot in the presentation about acquisitions, potentially some bolt-ons in the US. Could you potentially give us sort of a more indication on size here or even on a timeline in terms of when we should expect a deal to come through? Is that something that we could expect in the second half of ’24 or even going more into 2025? Any more color there, please?\nStephane Simonetta : We have a strong funnel that we are working on, on our three priorities, like I mentioned. So we expect to make progress in the short mid-term on this. And the bolt-on is as per our current strategy when we reported in the last Capital Market Day in 2021.\nChase Coughlan: Yeah.\nStephane Simonetta : With the areas of America, hydrolic flow control and advanced mechatronics or in the US and maybe also in Southeast Asia for advanced mechatronics.\nChase Coughlan: Yeah. Okay, very clear. Thank you, gentlemen.\nStephane Simonetta : Thank you.\nRutger Relker: Thank you all. We have received some questions which have been submitted via the Q&A form. And I'd like to start with this one. Yeah, this is a question whether we could repeat or give perhaps even a bit more clarity about what we said about cost reductions being more visible in the second half versus the first half. And as a result, follow-up question, can we also see margin evolving even better?\nArno Monincx: What we can say about that is that we have, as Stephane I think also explained, we have already started a lot of, let's say, structural reduction actions. So reduction of structural cost actions. We have started a lot of that. I just explained some of these costs are already taken in the first half year, which also, let's say, was for the holding/eliminations cost to be more or less flat versus last year because the income from the insurers we also allocated to that part of improving the business. And we expect more to come in the second half year. And that will also then give the benefits in the second half of the year of these structural cost improvements.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Arno. There's another question.\nArno Monincx: And even more important is that it's also really improving our basis for [2015] because then we have the full year benefit.\nStephane Simonetta : I think we have seen that we are able to flex all our variable costs and actually improve. So most of the action we are taking now is to address, of course, some short-term volatile demand but also prepare for the long term, having a lower fixed cost base. So when the rebound of activity will come, we'll be even better prepared to continue our margin expansions.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. There's another question which probably has been answered already, but let's repeat it because apparently it's an important question. Again, about what growth trends could we expect building tech and industrial tech in the second half of this year?\nStephane Simonetta : I think we can repeat. So soft demand we expect will continue, so more second half similar to the first half on the building tech. And a bit the same on the industrial tech because we see mixed demand. So that's what we expect.\nArno Monincx: But just to remind you that last year the second half also was weaker than the first half organically. So from a comparison base it might be a little bit easier.\nRutger Relker: Yeah, okay, thank you. Stephane, there's another question for you. Specifically, how do you make progress on your observations after your onboarding?\nStephane Simonetta : Yes, thank you for asking. I'm pleased to say that we are making good progress and actually now we are more in action mode based on some of my first observations, right? So continuing to invest and accelerating on all our people and culture agenda as we just welcome also a new member in our executive team. So it's also preparing for the future, having the right leadership, talent development, diversity. So this is well in progress. The second point was operational excellence. So we continue what we have been doing but now we are even investing more to become leaner and faster, to improve our service level, reduce our inventory and also optimize our CapEx. So a lot is put on the machine utilization, better maintenance and we are adding a lot of capabilities to drive that, also preparing for the long term. And on technology and innovation also, especially in building technology, we are working also on some initiatives to prepare and work on some innovative solutions to offer more than product and offer solutions to our customers in both residential and commercial buildings. So that's some of the things we accelerated in the second half, preparing for the long term, so no short term impact but preparing the long term.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, there's another question also for you Stephane. Can you explain again, what do you mean with portfolio optimization?\nStephane Simonetta : Yeah, I think it's a good one. It's one of our four strategic actions. So portfolio acquisition is to, and that's something which we will always do, right? Internally or externally, right? I think we always need to optimize our portfolio to make sure it's a portfolio where the market is growing, where we can have a good position, where we can be in the leading position and where we can make good margin in a sustainable way. That go back to Aalbert's DNA, sustainable and profitable. So what it means now on one hand is to do acquisitions, so that's what we are working on. And then what it means is divestment, based on an internal portfolio where we believe we are not the best owner. If there is lack of synergies or we believe there is a better owner than us that can invest in this business, we will simply divest it. And so that's what I mean for portfolio optimization.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Stephane. I think I have no further questions now coming in. So I think that we can conclude today's webcast. So, first of all, I would like to thank each of you for your participation. I hope today's presentation has provided you with a clear understanding of our achievements, our financial health and once again confirmed our strategic direction going forward. Thank you once again for joining us today. Good day.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you.\nA - Arno Monincx: Thank you.",

    "fullTranscript": "Rutger Relker: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. It is my pleasure to welcome you to Aalberts Full Year Presentation for the year 2023. Live in our headquarter in Utrecht. My name is Rutger Relker, Director, Investor Relations. This past year, we welcomed Stephane Simonetta as our new CEO. Together with our CFO, Arno Monincx, we look forward to share our progress made with you today. Stephane will kick off the presentation with our strategy and objectives and give an update on our operational developments. This will be followed by Arno who will share our financial development, highlighting how our strategy has translated into a solid financial performance. Then, Stephane will give some color on 2024. After the presentation, we will give you the opportunity to engage directly with us in the Q&A session. Your questions and feedback are very important to us. And so we encourage you to participate. Later today, we will make the presentation and the recording of this webcast available on the website. Please welcome Stephane Simonetta to begin our presentation.\nStephane Simonetta: Welcome to all of you. It’s a true pleasure for me to be here today in our headquarter for the first time to present our full year result. But before going into the business update, let me pass two personal messages. First of all, I would like to say thank you, Wim, because the great performance we are delivering in 2023 has been also under the leadership of Wim until September when I took over. And the second personal note is to say thank you to all our employees for the great welcome I receive. So now I’ll be giving you three update. First of all, our strategy deployment. Second, it will be about our operational update. And third, it will be about our end market dynamics. But before going into the business update, let me start that there are still three macro trends that are impacting our future where we in Aalberts with our mission-critical technologies can help. It’s about urbanization, energy and resource scarcity, Internet of Things. And all of these three drivers are actually growth drivers for us. So, long-term growth agenda is still relevant for us. And you may wonder, what is the impact that we are making? And as I like to say, Aalberts is actually everywhere. We are in buildings, where we are helping installers save time and helping the building owner save energies. We are in microchips, where we are helping our customers with great innovation to ensure the world will have more and more chips as the world is getting more and more connected. And then we are in sustainable transportation, where we are helping our customers in automotive, in aerospace, in marine, reaching their decarbonization target, but also improving safety, reducing fuel consumption, and reducing manufacturing costs. When we talk about strategy, I just would like to come back to what actually we shared in the last Capital Markets Day. And we still have the same four strategic actions. So I will give you an update right now, one by one, where we are in our deployment, because for us, it’s all about strategy execution. And as you know, first of all, it’s about to continue to optimize our portfolio. Second, it’s about delivering revenue organic growth. Third, it’s about our operational excellence. And fourth, what we call in Aalberts, sustainable entrepreneurship. So let me share with all of you now an update on these four points. Regarding our portfolio optimization, as you know, over the last 2 years, we have been doing some acquisition and some divestment. Some great acquisitions around advanced mechatronic, around water treatment for heating systems, and some divestment where we believe we were not the best owner. And my promise to all of you is that we will continue this journey to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions, and at the same time to divest when we believe we are not the best owner of the companies. Secondly, when we talk about organic growth, the way we want to do it with more and more innovation. And I just would like to share with you on this slide, four good examples of innovations, where we are helping to distribute water, where we are helping to save energies, where we are helping to innovate with breakthrough technologies of improving the material lifetime or the material characteristic of the components. This is a great enabler to continue to sustain organic growth, thanks to our innovation of business development. But organic growth, it’s also the way we continue to focus on our four end market. And I’m pleased to share with you an update that you can see on this slide. First of all, the split according to our 4 end markets. And you may see that we are continuing to be strong on eco-friendly building with roughly half of our revenue. But you may notice that the semicon efficiency is now 14%. And we have moved from 6% to 14% over a few years, just showing the portfolio transformation that has been happening over the years. And now we have a much more balanced portfolio between our industrial part and our building part. Now looking at the regional split, we continue to be very strong in West Europe, being also growing in Americas. But for me, the takeaway is that we can still do much more in the Americas, and this is where we will continue also to invest. But you may wonder that on the geographical side what are the differences between building and industry. So let me give you an update now by business segment. What you can see on this slide is actually that on building, we are also well balanced from a geographical point of view. We are still very strong in West Europe. But as you see, we have also good position in Americas and East Europe. And this is actually important to us because we see different markets dynamics. Sometimes West Europe, it’s more slowing down. We see now some challenge on the new construction build. Renovation is still a question mark, but we see growth opportunity in the U.S. and in East Europe. So more balanced portfolio. Now, on the industrial side, you will see that we are really with a major share on the, in Europe. But this is simply because we follow our customers, and our footprint is always close to our customers. You can imagine that in service, in surface technologies, you need to be close to our customers. That’s why we are so much present in Europe, and that in our semicon efficiency, we are also delivering our customers who are mostly present in Europe. And we continue, wherever our customer goes, we will continue to move our footprint in Europe or in Asia, should they decide to move there. And talking about footprint, you know we have increased our CapEx, our investment to support organic growth, to support demand increase. And I would like to show you some great examples of some of the world-class operations that we are building. Some of these buildings, some of these factories, have been recognized as the most sustainable buildings in the world. We are investing in semicon efficiency. We are investing in buildings in Europe, and also in North America to also support geographical expansions. And we will continue to invest in additional capacity because this is about the long-term, not about short-term dynamic. And we remain confident for the long-term. The last point about the strategy update, as you know, is what we call sustainable entrepreneurship. And I’m really pleased to report to all of you that we have already reached our 70% target in 2023. And now the challenge is on us to sustain this performance year-after-year. As you know, our business is closely linked to 4 of the sustainable development goals. It’s about moving and distributing water, saving energy, innovating breakthrough technologies, and also improving the lifetime of the materials. And you see the breakdown by sustainable development goals. As I said, we will continue to reach 70% or even do higher. And when we talk about the long-term, no change with our ambition. Once again, we want to be carbon neutral by 2050 or earlier. But let me point you on this slide, the key highlight is our 2023 improvement. We are already at minus 33% in our CO2 intensity compared to 2018. But I think the most important message is that in the coming year, in 2024, we will not only measure our Scope 3, we will start to disclose our progress on our Scope 3 emissions. So more to come in our annual report. And the good news is that it’s not only about us measuring ourselves. We are really pleased that the progress we have made over the years is actually recognized externally by some of these global standards or indexes, just showing that our improvements are also working and are being recognized. So great job by all our teams around the world. At the end, strategy actions need to be measured. And you know that we have six key objectives that we are shared in the last Capital Markets Day. So let me share with all of you where we are regarding our 2026 target. It’s all about organic growth. You have seen in our press release earlier today, we deliver 4.5%, so on track with our 4% to 6% 2026 target. We are now at 15.7% in EBITA, getting close to our target, 16% to 18%. Still some work to do, but improving slowly but surely. Regarding our ROSE, also improving. And this is also where we have still have some work to do to deliver the 18% to 20% range in the coming 2 years. And our innovation rate lacks the sustainability, actually. We already reached 20%. But now the goal is to sustain that year-after-year, because as you know, our innovation rate is based on the last 4 years’ revenue, all the innovation we have been doing. So this is why we will continue to invest in innovation for the coming years. Our SDG rate, as I mentioned, we are now on track, so we’ll continue to ensure we sustain that level. And our leverage ratio is actually quite good. We are much better than our long-term target, but I will let Arno say a few words about that in the financial update. So now, let’s talk about the operational development. How has been 2023? And I will be starting, of course, to talk about organic growth because we have actually managed well the headwinds in the building technology with an organic growth of minus 1.2%. But on the other hand, we continue to grow double digit in industry, in semiconductors, in transportation, and in all our industrial niches. The supply chain situation has improved in 2023. Of course, we see now new challenges in ‘24, but we have improved our service level and we have continued to drive operational excellence, to sustain our high-level margin and continue to improve our profitability. Fantastic job, once again, done by our teams in all our businesses. When you look at innovation, we are at 20%, but when we think about the long-term, we will continue to invest, to ensure we innovate, to differentiate, to continue to help some of our customer challenges, either in product, either in solutions, or either in services. And on sustainability, you will see in our annual report that we are making great progress on CO2 intensity, but also on waste management and also on circularity, together with our suppliers or sometimes with our customers. And you can count on us to continue to make an impact for the environment. So our Aalbert people did a fantastic job in 2023. And talking about people, as you know, in Aalberts, we say the Aalberts way, it’s about winning with people. But when we look at safety, when we look at last time injuries, we are improving, but this is not good enough. So we will continue to invest, to improve the safety of all our employees in our businesses. We will continue to focus on diversity, because focusing on diversity is also an enabler to improve performance, to drive innovation. We are pleased to have 32% of women in our leadership team, but we want to go even further. And investing in people, it’s about, of course, ensuring all our employees are motivated and satisfied. It’s also ensuring that we continue to develop all our employees. So we take feedback seriously. We got some good insights about what we are doing. And as you see, we have developed and trained more than 950 colleagues around the world. So count on us to continue to invest in all our people to ensure the long-term growth of the company. So the last part of my update before going to the financials, it’s our focus on end market. And when we talk about buildings, let me first start to say long-term, we still see growth driver. Because of buildings need simply to be more eco-friendly because all the buildings need actually to save energy. And this is where we have great solutions, either with our integrating piping solution or with our hydronic solutions. And in 2023, we have done actually quite a good job because all the lower demand, all the inventory reduction of our employees, all the new construction bill going down. We have been able to manage that thanks to our business development initiative, thanks to our sales growth, thanks to our also geographical expansion. So managing the headwinds has been done, I think, very well by our teams. And long-term, it’s still a growth agenda. Even if the new build is going down, renovation is more stable. And once again, as I shared earlier, the geographical dynamics are quite different between Europe or West Europe, which will likely more plateau, but still growth opportunity in the U.S. and in Poland. On the semicon efficiency, it’s still a growth agenda. Let’s make it very short and let’s make it very clear because the world will need more and more chips because our customers are asking us to ramp-up capacity. We have done a great job to improve our service level, more on-time delivery to our customers. And we still see positive trend on the transportation side with a decarbonization coming up from the automotive, from aerospace, also from the marine, where we are supplying some of the biggest other car maker, plane makers, or ship builders. So at the end, different dynamic where we are I think doing a good job thanks to our mission-critical technology or thanks to our unique innovation and business development plan. Talking about sustainable transportation, as I just mentioned, the industry is going through a major transformation. And this is where we see also mix picture. Maybe sometimes some industries are going down but there is always opportunity for us. And even if sometimes there are some change, right, between electrification and more combustible engine, we are actually quite resilient because we can support both and we have the technology and the services to support actually any mix of change even of course we all hope that the decarbonization will accelerate in order to get moving all the things around the world. And in the industrial niche, we actually see a growth in all the region. This is, of course, sometimes very small business, but this is where sometimes also we are the only one to be able to provide this unique technology in some of the industrial place, in some of the agriculture. Sometimes it’s also about defense. So this is actually doing quite well. And our team did a great job in 2023. So let me wrap it up before I hand it over now to Arno about the financials. You have seen that we are still in strategy deployment mode and are well on track for 2026. You have seen that on the operational side, we have managed some of the headwind quite well, but we are still growing in industry. And that regarding the end market, we still see also a more balanced agenda. Thank you very much. Now let’s go to the financials with Arno.\nArno Monincx: Thank you, Stephane, and also welcome from my side, of course, to this webcast where I will take you through the financial development of Aalberts over 2023. And we start with the highlights where we see that our revenue grew with 3%, which was organically 4.5%. And as Stephane already mentioned, there was a clear organic growth in industrial technology, but also a small decline in building technology still facing headwinds. Nevertheless, we sustained our added value. And I think that is a great performance because first of all, as you may remember, in 2022, we build up our inventories because all the supply chain issues we face at that moment to secure our deliveries to the customers. But this year, 2023, we really reduced our inventories again. So nevertheless, with a solid pricing and also purchase saving initiatives, we managed to sustain our added value, a very good performance of our teams. EBITA, we increased 4%, €521 million towards a margin of 15.7%. Free cash flow, of course, record level when we reduced our inventories, I will come back to that later. But that resulted also in a very strong free cash flow performance. But also, CapEx increased again. Actually, also a record level, €224 million of CapEx spent, which is constantly investing in the future, in the business development programs, in the expansions of our company. And then last but not least, despite all these numbers, we also improved our ROCE again from 16.1% last year towards 16.8% this year. And last but not least, innovation rate increased towards 20%. And SDG rate, as also Stephane already mentioned, improved to 70%. So Albert’s delivered in 2023 a record EBITA and a record free cash flow. Then the revenue bridge about the revenue development in 2023, from the basis of 2022, we added €39.8 million from our acquisitions that we did. At the same time, we also lost €46.1 million from the divestments that we did. Then the currency impact versus the positive impact we had in 2022, we now face a negative impact of €36.7 million in 2023, mainly caused by the U.S. dollar. And that results then in organic revenue growth, as mentioned, 4.5% of €137 million towards the €3.324 billion revenue in 2023. EBITA bridge, the same, started from the €500.3 million of 2022. We added from our acquisitions €7.1 million, almost flatting out with the divestments, where we lost €6.7 million. And then the currency impact also in the EBITA, negative €5.5 million versus a positive effect loss in 2022. And then last but not least, the organic increase of EBITA €25.8 million totalizing towards the €521 million in 2023, being 15.7%. Then the EPS bridge. We started with the €3.37 of 2022, where we added from our acquisitions €0.06, but also the same we lost with our divestments, so that is a neutral effect. And then you also see the organic increase of €0.24, but also that also our company, even with a very strong balance sheet, is facing higher finance costs with an increased interest rate, and that is costing €0.17. Then besides that, also some high effective tax rate of €0.02 and of course also here the currency impact. So at the end, we managed to increase our EPS, but only with €0.01. The consolidated income statement, clearly, you see here the 2 years next to each other. EBITDA finished at 19.9% in 2023, which was also 30 basis points better than last year. You see also the increase of depreciation, which is of course logic with the increased CapEx programs that we are executing already for quite some time now. Then the EBITA improvements, and here also the net finance cost being €18.6 million higher than last year, despite a very good cash flow, despite, I come to that later, a very good net debt position. Income tax expense more or less the same, and at the end, that results in €3.38 versus €3.37 last year. A strong and resilient performance. The balance sheet, equity position over 60%, 60.8% solvability, very strong. But also, here you see that the net debt decreased from almost €800 million in 2022 towards €583 million in 2023, which brings the leverage ratio down from 1.3 in 2022 to 0.9 in 2023. Working capital improvement, one of the drives, of course, also for the strong cash flow. And at the end, the return on capital employed increased towards 16.8%. It’s a strong financial position, and we are ready with this balance sheet also to accelerate our growth agenda. Free cash flow. EBITDA, €29 million higher than last year. Good performance. Also, here you see the gain on disposal of subsidiaries, where we are a little bit lower than last year, €4.4 million. On the other side, we had some sale of equipment where we were a little bit higher than last year. These 2 years, quite comparable as you can see. And what we do, as always, and I also wrote it in our financial development in press release, we are investing these disposal gains towards improvement of our company in operational excellence initiatives, which we also did this year. And again, the net effect of these 2 years is more or less the same. Then change in provisions and changes in provision exceptional. That’s an important line. Also, as you may remember, in 2021, we took an exceptional cost for our operational excellence program at that time, and we finished the year 2021 with a provision on the balance sheet of €12.5 million, which were the costs that we already booked in our profit and loss account, but on the same time did not yet spend as cash out. Now you can see here over the 2 years, 2022 and 2023, how this €12.5 million was going into the cash flow statement. And at the end of 2023, also deadline is at zero in our balance sheet. So no exceptional costs anymore provided for in the balance sheet. Then change in working capital, there you see really the big improvement in free cash flow versus the negative €243 million last year, we managed even to realize a positive change in working capital of about €10 million. That gives the strong cash flow from ops, of yes, €276 million higher than 2022. And then we still also spent a record number of cash out for our investments, for our CapEx, €30 million higher than last year. Some purchases of intangibles a little bit higher and the proceeds from the sales equipment resulting in our free cash flow of €423 million versus €168 million last year, a very good performance. Our segment reporting, here we are reporting our financials in two segments, but you also see how our technology clusters are representing these two segments. So hydronic flow control, integrated piping systems are representing the building technology part, and advanced mechatronics and surface technologies are representing the industrial technology part. And here you see also the reporting per business segment. Building, we faced headwinds. We faced headwinds. And also, what you see here is the organic revenue growth finished negative at 1.2%. It’s also very clear that the volume reduction that we faced in the first half year was less in the second half year. And that’s also why you see that the EBITA margin full year of 14.3% is better than the 14.0% that we report in the first half year of 2023. So clearly, we see also the trend that the volume reduction has reduced. Still, of course, lower than what we would like and therefore still we believe in the long-term perspective of this business with all the renovations that are ongoing in the future. Industrial technology, very solid performance. We made an organic revenue growth of 12.4% and an EBITA improvement even versus the very good year 2022 of 17.7% in 2023. Also from a CapEx perspective, you see that we are investing heavily also in this segment with a lot of, yes, footprint expansion, but also business development and innovation plans to be executed. The dividend, we are proposing a cash dividend of €1.13 per share, which is €0.02 higher than last year. And also over the last 10 years, you see our CAGR of over 11%, which we believe is a very good value contribution for our shareholders. A proven sustainable business model, that is what Aalberts is about. And that is what you also see here during our history. We constantly manage with headwinds, with good markets, with slower markets. We are always able to perform in a good way. And that is what you see in this result. At the end, we finished higher, better than last year in a difficult year again. The shareholder value creation, our track record, earnings per share over the last 10 years, a CAGR of more than 9%, €1.38 in 2013, €3.38 in 2023. At the same time, the dividend per share is increasing even more, more than 11%, so that means also, as you may know, over the last 5 years, we increased also our pay ratio from 30% to 33%. Return on incremental capital employed, a very important indicator, how we are allocating our capital and how successful we are with that. Now, over the last 10 years, we managed to increase our EBITA with €294 million against an increase of capital employed, and this is including CapEx, of course, but also goodwill of acquisitions. €1.409 billion extra capital employed, which means over the last 10 years, 20.9% return on incremental capital employed. And this is an important indicator also for our ROCE on a yearly basis, of course. So as long as this percentage is above 20%, we are moving towards this 18% to 20% objective that we have in 2026. And yes, we are happy with our stable long-term shareholders who believe that we are creating value for them. A proven sustainable business model. And that brings me to Stephane again, who will give his perspective towards 2024. Thank you.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you, Arno. I’m sure you have seen our strong financial performance. But of course, this was 2023. Let me now share a few of my perspective looking forward for 2024. First of all, starting by the market. We see different markets dynamic by geography, by end markets. And when we start at the buildings, we see most likely that Europe, West Europe, will plateau. But on the other hand, we still see growth opportunity in the U.S. and in East Europe. So more balanced pictures. On the industrial side, it’s always, and the growth agenda will continue, short-term and long-term. Of course, the question is, are we going to see the same double-digit growth in 2024 and 2023? But let’s not forget that long-term we need to invest. We have a very strong order book in our semicon efficiency, and we still see opportunity also with geographical expansion in our surface technology business. In capital allocation, you have seen our strong balance sheet, you have seen our strong cash position. So we are ready to do bolt-on acquisitions, but also potentially to do more divestments according to our four end markets and according to our strategies. And we will continue to improve on sustainable entrepreneurship. And the key highlight of 2024 is that we will start to disclose our Scope 3 emission, but continue also to improve our waste management and also do even more on circularity. More to come in our next annual result in our annual report, where we’ll disclose some of the progress and what we plan to do in 2024. So when I look at 2024, our portfolio is actually quite balanced and we are ready to manage some of the headwinds and still having some growth opportunity to manage these headwinds. And the outlook, I have only two key message to pass to you. We will continue to deploy our strategy. We still have some work to do to reach all our objective in 2026, but we will continue with our four key strategic action. Continue to optimize our portfolio, focus on organic growth with great innovation, with additional investment and with geographical footprint, drive operational excellence, continue to optimize our footprint, but do even more on internal efficiencies and productivities. And we still have some opportunity also on inventory management to go even below and have a better mix in our inventories. And we will not stop on sustainable entrepreneurship. Because at the end, I think what is important for me, and I know for all our colleagues, is that Aalberts has a key role to play. Aalberts is everywhere. We are where technology matters. And since 1975, we have been engineering mission-critical technologies to enable clean, smart, and responsible future. And we will not stop here. You can count on us to do all we can to make not only a positive impact, but also a lasting impact. So before going to the Q&A session, I just would like to say thank you for watching, but also a huge thank you to all our shareholders for their trust and their loyalties. Also, a thank you to all our customers for their business and sometimes for their patience as we have still have some delivery or service challenges. But fantastic, thank you, and congratulations to all our Aalberts colleagues, we did an outstanding job to deliver a strong and resilient year in 2023. Thank you very much.\nA - Rutger Relker: [Operator Instructions] I would now like to give the word to David Kerstens from Jefferies for the first questions. Good morning. David.\nDavid Kerstens: Good morning, Rutger. Thank you very much for taking my questions. And well done on the resilient performance. I will ask – I’ve got three questions. I will ask them one by one. First of all, can you please explain the volume and pricing dynamics in the second half of the year? As it seems, pricing got a bit weaker towards the end of the year, while volume momentum picked up. And what are the implications of that for 2024, please?\nArno Monincx: Yes. Let’s say, as you know, David, thank you for your question. Yes. We managed, especially in the Q4 2022, we made our bigger price increases. And in 2023, the pricing initiatives were rather limited. So the pricing effect is really going down automatically during the year. So as we have said in the first half year, we still assume the pricing impact of 7% for Aalberts in total. And in the full year, we are assuming a 4.5% pricing effect for Aalberts in total, which makes automatically if you calculate that to your – in your numbers that the volume impact in the second half of the year was more positive than in the first half of the year. Especially also in the building side. So the building technology segment reduced quite a bit volume in the first 6 months. And in the second 6 months, we saw clearly there that the reduction was slowing down.\nDavid Kerstens: Yes, understood. And based on that, resilient performance in volume, your margins were relatively more stable. Is that the key driver in building technology in the second half of the year, while you managed to keep margins at 14.5%? And can you please also elaborate on the outlook for building technology in a bit more detail with regards to new builds and renovation? When do you expect markets will be strong enough for a return to positive volume growth supported by easy comps after last year’s destocking and a recovery of margins?\nStephane Simonetta: Maybe I can take this one, right? And Arno...\nArno Monincx: Of course.\nStephane Simonetta: You can add, of course, I know, right. You are right to say 2024 will definitely be more challenging because there are still many uncertainties and the dynamics are quite different by geography but also by end market. If we take West Europe, we all see the new construction bills going down our plateau while renovation is still a question mark. So that could be some of the headwinds. But on the other hand, I think I mentioned it earlier, we still see organic growth opportunities in the U.S. and in East Europe, where also on buildings, talking to our customers, talking to our partners, there is more confidence. So it will be a challenging year, but with a different, I think, dynamic based on the geographical split on the building technology side.\nArno Monincx: And let’s say again, David, what we saw in 2023 is that the reduction of volume decline of building also had some positive impact in the EBITA performance of building technology as such. So from 14.0% in the first 6 months, we increased to 14.5% in the second 6 months. And as you may always count on also on our teams, they did a great job also to, of course, take all kinds of actions in cost. And when your top-line is under pressure, you have to anticipate to that. So everybody did a great job there to protect as much as possible their margin, which was at the end resulting even in an improvement in the second half year.\nStephane Simonetta: And I think on when it will get up, it’s a very good question, David, because we, as you know, our customers have reduced a lot their inventories, right. So the inventories are at a very low level. And I think we cannot imagine that it will go even lower, right. We do not know, of course, what our customers are planning, but now it’s more what is going in is getting out. And the question mark is when the wholesaler or customers are going to get back on their stocking profile. And that’s a big question mark. It could happen in the second half, but today, we don’t know enough. So we just know the inventory are lows and we cannot imagine that they will go even lower.\nDavid Kerstens: Thank you. That’s great. And maybe a final question on semicon efficiency has now increased to 14% of revenue. Can you elaborate on the growth drivers going forward? And do you see any impact from the hype around artificial intelligence driving ASML and NVIDIA currently?\nStephane Simonetta: I think like I mentioned, David, long-term is just a growth agenda, right. And there may be, of course, different growth dynamics year-over-year. But we are now building factories. We are investing capacity for 2027, ‘28 and beyond. Our order book is at a very strong level on semicon efficiency. And we still get, of course, a lot of pressure for our customers to ensure ability and supply. That’s what is I think the top priority right now. But at the same time, we are looking also at new business opportunity with new innovation. And let’s not forget that when we talk about bolt-on acquisition, there are still also potentially opportunities to increase our portfolio and continue to add mission-critical technology to serve our customers in the semicon industries.\nDavid Kerstens: Great. Thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, David. I would now like to give the word to Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen, who is in the line. So Chase? Chase has left. So Luuk Van Beek from the Degroof Petercam. Please welcome this morning.\nLuuk Van Beek: Yes. Good morning. I have two questions. The first one is on acquisition plans you mentioned that you have a very strong balance sheet which you obviously do. And that you wouldn’t want to use it for a bolt-on acquisition, but if I look at the diversification opportunities and the growth opportunities especially, [Technical Difficulty] would you also consider to do bigger acquisitions to really make a step forward there in terms of your offering in those areas?\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question. I’m not sure I got the beginning of your question about divestment, but I think I understood the question on big acquisition. We – as I mentioned, we are in strategy deployment mode. Our current strategy is to do bolt-on acquisition. I think in our Capital Markets Day, we even put some amount about the size we are ready, so today to make huge acquisition is not part of our current strategy, right, so we will continue to do bolt-on acquisition mostly around our advanced mechatronics like we have been doing, mostly around our hydronic flow control business, and also around the USA, this is where we will be looking at, but not major and still bolt-on acquisition. According to the, I think frame, we disclosed in the last Capital Markets Day.\nArno Monincx: We remain very disciplined in our capital allocation, Luuk.\nLuuk Van Beek: You have some – such a strong balance sheet, if it continues like this, it could become under leveraged. So that’s, I was wondering what you want to do then, if that happens?\nArno Monincx: Let’s say what we said, we are ready again to make acquisitions. As you know, last year, with the transition of leadership, clearly there we took a break in acquisitions, which I think makes sense. And now, with Stephane being on board again, we are ready to do so. So you may expect acquisitions in 2024.\nLuuk Van Beek: And I have a question on the industrial markets. If you can give a bit more color on the various parts because take for example, sustainable transportation. There are quite some things moving like, on the one hand, automotive manufacturers are becoming more hesitant on growing in electric vehicles. On the other hand, I think Airbus is growing at the expense of Boeing, which could be favorable for you. So can you give a bit more color of all the developments that you see there, the main ones?\nStephane Simonetta: Yes. I think it’s a great question. And you are right that automotive could be more challenging, right, as we see different dynamics. But we see actually super strong growth on aerospace, on marine, and some other industry segments. Because we have some technologies which are unique. And this is helping some of our customers. And we do not always supply directly the airplane manufacturer, while sometimes we are more the Tier 2. So we supply Tier 1 that are supplying Airbus or Boeing. And here it’s about growth agenda. We have also strong order book. We are expanding our capacity to continue to deliver some unique components. Because we are helping our customers to reduce fuel, to reduce cost, to improve safety. And on automotive, we are actually quite agnostic about the technology. Of course, we all hope that the automotive will continue the transformation on decarbonization. But either it’s more EV or more combustion engine. For us, that does not have a significant impact regarding our growth trajectory. Right. Of course, if the economy and there is less car being produced, that will have an impact on us. But the switch is actually less critical for us in the way we do all our surface treatment, all our material and characteristics.\nLuuk Van Beek: Okay, that’s clear. Thank you. \nRutger Relker: [Operator Instructions] Well, we are waiting for possible more live questions. I also see already some questions coming in. I think now, let me see. Yes, Martijn den Drijver, ABN AMRO. Good morning, Martijn.\nMartijn den Drijver: Good morning, gentlemen. From the snowy slopes of Tignes Val d'Isère.\nStephane Simonetta: Good place.\nMartijn den Drijver: I have a question and it continues to build on one that my colleague from Jeffries also asked. You previously mentioned in, when talking about semicon 2024, perhaps low to mid-single digit organic growth. But since then, we’ve had ASML with very strong order intake and indeed there’s the AI hype. So is that still slightly cautious remark about growth? Has that now been – has that changed basically? Are you now probably, are you perhaps now sensing that there could be an acceleration in the second half based on that improvement in the front end? That would be question one.\nStephane Simonetta: I can only say we don’t want to change what we said last time. We are still very cautious, right. We still see a growth agenda, but I think it’s too soon to change what we shared with you last time regarding the outlook for 2024. I think that will be my short and simple answer. So not yet.\nMartijn den Drijver: Got it. And then secondly, you mentioned in the press release that the savings from, excuse me, that the Disptek gain will be used for operational excellence. Can you elaborate a little bit on what you mean by that? Is that an acceleration of the operational excellence program? And if so, what kind of savings can or should we expect from that investment between brackets?\nArno Monincx: Let’s say like we always do, as you know, Martijn, we are investing our disposal gains towards operational excellence initiatives. And also, let’s say in 2023, we did between €15 million and €20 million of operational access initiatives with a payback of 2 years to 3 years. So that will for sure help also in ‘24 and onwards to improve our profitability. Besides, of course, we always have one offs as we have always. So the total net effect. And that is also important to understand our numbers. As you can see in the holding eliminations there, you see that the total costs have increased of holding eliminations. And that is really the – let’s say effect of higher holding and holding costs, not of higher or lower disposal benefits, because they are yes, spot on equal last year and this year.\nMartijn den Drijver: Thanks, Arno for getting feedbacks element. Because I was indeed wondering how that works, because we have a €30 million on Disptek, which means you have €90 million of other income, insurance payouts, subsidies, grants to get to €49 million of other income you reported for the year. You have maybe €9 million to €10 million of regular holding corporate costs, and you reported €5 million negatives. That leaves an unexplained delta of roughly €45 million. Should I see that €45 million as the investment in these cost savings or in this operational excellence program? Is that the way I should look at it?\nArno Monincx: On the other operating income is €49 million, as you say. And that is including, of course, let’s say the disposal benefits and the and of course, also the operational excellence initiatives that takes OpEx. So that is then causing the higher OpEx lines, which you cannot identify on the P&L. So therefore, we always explain, as we did also in previous years, the real incidental effect in our holding/elimination line, because as we have always been doing, the operational results in our segments are operational and clean, and we take all the exceptional benefits and costs in our holding/elimination line. So, let’s say the other operating income is in line, I would say a little bit lower than last year, it’s €5 million lower, but it’s also depending on the extra cost that we make, how the impact will be for the profitability, so there is no difference with last year.\nMartijn den Drijver: Now, the key one is that there is no one-off in the operational EBITA per division. Okay, clear. And then…\nArno Monincx: There as a one-off effect, but it’s par with last year, so it’s approximately €5 million last year and this year.\nMartijn den Drijver: Yes, but you mentioned that’s on the holding line. None of that impacts the divisional EBITA.\nArno Monincx: No.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. Moving on, you mentioned quite a number of elements that have supported the value-add and specifically in building tech, the EBITA margins. What you don’t talk about is the procurement savings, is there anything that you are willing to share of what that might contribute in 2024, because that was…?\nStephane Simonetta: I think I can take this one. Thanks for asking. And of course, this is where I think we are more positive regarding material costs management because we see the price of material getting down, more and more availability from our suppliers. So, our purchasing team are working on a very aggressive plan to sustain our margin. So, this is where, and it can be sometimes single or even double digit material cost saving that we see in 2024. So, more opportunities definitely compared to 2023.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. That’s clear. And one final question, basically on the same subject. So, raw mats probably moving in a favorable direction. How about energy, is that also coming your way in 2024 relative to 2023?\nArno Monincx: A little bit more difficult to predict, of course. But as it looks right now, it is also going down a bit, the effect. But we don’t know how that looks like in two months, three months, as you know.\nMartijn den Drijver: Yes. We know them, but looking at it. Okay. Those are my question so far. Thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Martijn. I would now like to give the word to Maarten Verbeek from The IDEA. Good morning Maarten.\nMaarten Verbeek: Good morning all and thank you. A couple of questions from my end, please. As you stated, you made some good progress with your working capital, but you are still not within your targeted range. Do you believe you could be in that range at year end, or do you believe it will take a bit longer before you will be in that range, so that would be in 2025?\nArno Monincx: Now, what I explained at the end of 2022 is that we of course, made a steep increase in inventories to secure our delivery performance towards the customers with all these supply chain issues, and that we were aiming to go back to the normal level of, let’s say, before 2022, which is ‘21, in about 2 years. Now, I think we made a big step forward in that direction. It’s only a few days away from where we were at 2021. But of course, we will continue to further improve and optimize also our inventories to even a better level, so that is work in progress.\nMaarten Verbeek: Okay. Thank you. In the first half, you were facing some underutilization, particularly in that building. Do you still expect that to occur in this fiscal year?\nArno Monincx: Let’s say for as long as the volumes remain on the level where it is today, you could expect that is the same. But we don’t know exactly how this will look like. But as you can see in 2023, we managed well the headwinds. But of course, underutilizing a bit leading to a lower EBITA performance as the year before, that’s clear. So, yes, we will do our utmost to protect our margin also going forward. That’s just how we are doing the business.\nStephane Simonetta: That’s also one of the key priority going forward and there are operational excellence, strategic initiative, to focus more on higher utilization of our assets, doing leaner investments, continue to support the growth, but with better footprint optimization and better capacity utilization. Especially on the building side, I think this is where we have challenges, but also opportunities.\nMaarten Verbeek: And lastly, could you share with us what you expect to spend on capital expenditure this year?\nArno Monincx: Yes. Let’s say, as we also have guided, I think already in the Capital Markets Day in ‘21, it will be some higher years of CapEx. Now, like we said last year, €200 million, €250 million, I think we were quite spot on and that we expect at least the same also for 2024. So, there is a lot of projects, yes, also with a longer lead time than only 1 year, so we are continuing to invest also in 2024. So, €200 million, €250 million, you should take into account.\nMaarten Verbeek: Okay. Thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Maarten. I think now Ruben Devos from Kepler Cheuvreux. Good morning Ruben.\nRuben Devos: Yes. Good morning everyone. Thanks for letting me on. I actually have a first question related to semicon. I believe you talked about investing for capacity for ‘27, ‘28. You already realized €460 million in the semicom division. So, if you are preparing already for ‘27, ‘28, could you give some degree of how much capacity you are actually planning for, rough order of magnitude? Are you looking for maybe a high €100 million range, what should we be thinking of?\nStephane Simonetta: Yes, that’s – it’s difficult to, I think to predict. The order book is high. We are investing, and I think we have a good view on the coming 2 years, 3 years, but I will hate to give you numbers at this period of time, because I think it’s still more a range. We still see growth long-term. I will say, if you look at long-term, it’s high-single digit or low-double digit. That’s what we see long-term on the semicon industry, right. But to give you a number, I think that will be a bit premature at this point of time.\nArno Monincx: And as Stephane said, we also have an acquisition focus in this area. So, you may assume the increase of share in the total, that will continue, so.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And then thinking about, like obviously, we have seen a very positive news flake coming out from the semi-equipment space and also from AI, etcetera. How, like if you look at your major buying customers, ASML, ASM, KLA, and so on, is there any like other end markets that you are paying more attention to in terms of your systems are thinking, the vibration isolation systems, the high purity fluid systems, are they more penetrated in some specific segments, like logical memory, where you are more penetrated with your subsystems?\nStephane Simonetta: I think it’s a great question and that’s also very high in our agenda for the next strategy period. So, in the current strategy period, it’s still around the same, I think go-to-market or service to our customers. So, doing a few bolt-on acquisitions to increase our portfolio to deliver our current customers in this highly sophisticated equipment. Maybe also looking more at services, that’s what we are looking at, helping our customers also on their circular request. And then for the next strategy period, that will be something we will need to decide, do we want to expand, and be more front-end or more downstream in the value chain of the semiconductor industry, or do we want to stay here more upstream. So, good question, but I think very relevant for the next strategy period. So, count on us to be back when we will have made the decision, because then it will be the time for a new Capital Markets Day, sharing what we want to do beyond our current scope.\nRuben Devos: Alright. Thank you. And then just a final question on let’s say the margins, I think you sort of have that target objective of 25% drop through rate. I think it was 21%, 22% in ‘23 and up, but obviously you have had a bit more of challenges in the Building segment. I think you are also talking about a bit of a challenge here in ‘24, but you also talked about potentially strong savings in terms of raw material procurement. Is it fair to say maybe in ‘24 you would still be trending below that, let’s say, objective of 25%, but then once, obviously, you get higher utilization in the Building segment, then you see, renovation activity, new build activity that you would be turning ahead of that?\nArno Monincx: Now, let’s say that is really depending from the fact if we can really make volume growth again in building, because as you have calculated probably yourself, we made 19% drop-through in 2023 in total, clearly with a very good drop-through performance of industrial business and yes, even a negative drop of building with a volume decline that is logic. So, yes, let’s say, I expect because we saw already the improvements in the second half of the year, that that is also clearly what you can see in the EBITA performance. I expect that we can grow also drop-through again for building if we are able to make volume growth again. And that is clearly, of course, what is not yet so clear at this moment.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And the idea is still that maybe within industrial that it’s more straightforward to have that higher drop through for the surface treatment business as opposed to the semicon, or is it rather the same level?\nArno Monincx: Let’s say, clearly, the service technology business has a higher EBITA performance than the semicon business at this moment. But the semicon is still growing, also that has all impact on the EBITA performance. But at the end, they both do a very good performance, but semicon is even on the higher side.\nRuben Devos: Alright. Thank you very much.\nArno Monincx: Sorry, semicon. I said semicon, but I mean service technologies, yes.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Ruben. Now, I would like to give the word to Aurelio Calderon from Morgan Stanley. Good morning Aurelio.\nAurelio Calderon: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have got two, please. The first one is around what we talked about, the building blocks for pricing this year, ‘23, or sorry, last year in ‘23. Can we talk about what happens in ‘24, how you see, because you have talked about raw materials coming down, you talked about energy prices probably coming down. So, I am just wondering if you are seeing more pressure from your customers to take prices down, or you will do whatever it takes to at least protect prices. And that will be the first one, please.\nStephane Simonetta: I think, thank you, Aurelio for the great question. You are absolutely right. We – of course, we see many of our peers or other companies going massively on price reduction to get more volumes. But that’s not our strategy, right. There will be always someone cheaper than us, and we don’t want to go to this trend. So, we believe in our innovation, we believe in our differentiation, and we believe in our unique offering, right. So, now, of course it will be more challenging to push price increase in ‘24 than in 2023. But we still want to continue. And the price increase may be lower than in ‘23. But we are determined and I know our team are working very hard to manage because it’s, we still have sometimes some commodities on some part of our business, where we still see price increase also in our own value chain. So, we can’t also on this to pass to our customers. So, back to your question, yes, we see the pressure, right. But yes also, we will do all we can to continue to pass even modest price increase on our Building Technology segment.\nArno Monincx: And purchase saving initiatives, there is also now the supply chain, let’s say, availability has normalized again. We put much more focus again on our purchase saving initiatives. And I think also there we make progress.\nAurelio Calderon: That’s great. Thank you. And the second question is around market share. You talked about, I think it’s for the Building segment, but you talked about market share gains. And I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on how you are gaining market share? Is it because of innovation? Is it because of availability? And what are the drivers between market share gains? And if you can also touch on what you have seen in terms of market share developments in the other verticals would be helpful as well.\nStephane Simonetta: Yes, that’s a very good question. And sometimes it’s very painful, but sometimes it’s also, it’s a great opportunity because you are absolutely right. First of all, it’s about availability, right. And now, I think with the supply chain improvement, if I look at West Europe, even at the beginning of the year, we are doing quite a great job because we have super good availabilities. Our factories are delivering. We have our distribution center full, and we can offer short lead time. And now, many of our customers and wholesalers actually want our product, based on the best-in-class quality, based on the best services, and the long-term and reliability of our offerings. But of course, when we are not able to deliver, this is also becoming a challenge. And if I look at the Americas, this is where we have some opportunities to improve our service level for our customers and gain market share. So, it’s I would say availability in ‘24 could help us to manage some of the headwind, even if there is a global market demand. But I know in the U.S., we could gain market share with better service.\nAurelio Calderon: Yes. That’s great. Thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: If that’s your last question, Aurelio, thank you so much. Then I think it’s now time to go to some of the questions submitted via the webcast. And I will start with the first one here. Perhaps that’s a good one for Arno. It’s a question about the CapEx level after 2024, would it be more normative, would it go down?\nArno Monincx: Let’s say we have guided, of course, in the Capital Markets Day of 2021, that we increase our CapEx towards €200 million, €250 million. So, that will take until the end of this period. Nevertheless, of course, we expect in the short-term that we are on the high side of that because of all the big projects that are running. And besides late – perhaps later on, it will go down a bit, but we still see lots of growth potential opportunities to which we allocate our CapEx. And at the end, CapEx do have a very good return. So, it’s always accretive to our ROCE performance, which is also an important target for us to realize. So, yes, we see as far as long as we see allocate, as we see opportunities to make returns from our CapEx, we will continue to do so. And I think the guidance has been quite clear until 2026.\nStephane Simonetta: I will add, on top of what Arno said that, what you will see also is a change in mix of our CapEx. Less in buildings, because you are right, when the capacity will be there, we will be ready to grab the growth. And more in R&D, more in innovation, because we are quite good for the next 4 years, as on the business development we did, without 20%, but there are still many opportunities to innovate solutions for our customers. We still have some room with also the digitalization agenda. And this is where, within our frames, as we will be spending less in buildings in the coming years, we can spend more on R&D for the long-term growth agenda that we have.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Stephane. There is another question about M&A. What would be your key priorities in M&A?\nStephane Simonetta: Yes, that’s – thank you. I think first of all, you know very well, right, I think better than me, that we have a very successful M&A playbook in Aalberts. We have been doing that for many years and we have been great at doing bolt-on acquisition of strategic agenda. We will continue to do that focusing on our four key end markets, right. That’s the strategic compass, right. And you can count on us to be very disciplined in this allocation. And I will just mention, like I have been sharing I think to some of our investors and shareholders over the last weeks, we have three key priorities in our M&A agenda, right. It’s about first of all, hydronic flow controls, because we see opportunities to continue to expand our portfolio. When you go in the boiler rooms, you see what we are doing with our expansion vessel, with our air-dirt separators. Now, we have also heat treatment for heating solutions, but we could also do more to do full solution package for the commercial buildings. So, that’s one element, but hydronic flow control is also in the U.S. where we are quite small. This is where also we believe, we will be much faster by doing some great acquisition to also enter the residential side in the U.S. So, number one, hydronic flow control. The second one, advanced mechatronics to continue what we started also with our semicon efficiency agenda. As you have seen over the last 2 years, we did some great add in our portfolio and we will continue to do that. But advanced mechatronics could be also a geographical expansion. I think I explained it that in this business, you need to be close to your customers. So, if our customers are also moving the assembly equipment in other part of the world, we will be following it. And then we may do also some acquisition in other parts of the world outside Europe for the semicon efficiency business. The last priority, in the U.S., because for me, it’s important that in the long-term, we have also an even more balanced portfolio between Europe and USA. And we also have a good recipe. We have done, I think a great job in surface technologies with all the acquisitions we have been doing. But I still see many growth opportunities in terms of acquisition for the North America market. So, I would say these are key priorities for the coming years.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. There is another question about inventory level. Perhaps that’s a good one for you, Arno. You have reduced – we have reduced the inventory position in 2023, could we expect some further reduction in 2024?\nArno Monincx: Yes, as I already explained, we made a big increase in 2022. And we said at that time that we will probably need more than 1 year to come back to the normal level again. I think in 2023, we improved 11 days, which is a good, yes, let’s say a big step forward towards the direction of before the spike in 2022. We are not there yet, still have a few days to improve. But you can count on us that we will constantly try to further optimize our inventory, because at the end its capital employed and we have to be sure that we are most efficient in our – also in our inventory allocation. So, we will continue to improve that also in the years to go.\nStephane Simonetta: And this is also, as Arno mentioned, through our operational excellence agenda, we can also improve the way we manage our flows in our supply chain, and this as a result could optimize the days on hand that we have in our value chain on inventories. So, maybe having even better availabilities for our customers especially in the building, but maybe more streamlining our work in progress and our raw materials on the inbound from our former suppliers, so definitely the answer is yes, we will improve.\nRutger Relker: Yes, thank you. And this is a perhaps a nice bridge to another question which came in, whether you could perhaps share some more details on operational excellence. Is this just footprint reduction, optimization, or what’s your view on that?\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you. I think also what we share, right, it’s definitely more than footprint, right. So, we – don’t get me wrong, we will execute the plan and deliver on the objective we shared in the last Capital Markets Day because we can have a more simple footprint and continue to reduce number of sites. But like I have said, it’s not about the number of sites, right. It’s about the efficiency you drive. It’s about higher CapEx utilization. Higher I think also, health and safety for our employees, and better flows in our supply chain. So, all of that, through technologies, I think we can still do more and reduce our cost to produce, as an example, especially in the buildings, because this is I think, where we have the hydronic and the repetitive. Then in semicon is to also continue even it’s more a project business. And then on the service, I think this is more a footprint because also here we need to ensure we have the right utilization of our big furnaces, a huge oven that we have in some part of the world. So, that’s for me, what I call the end-to-end operational excellence.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. Quite clear. I think that we can conclude the Q&A session. And as we conclude today’s webcast, I want to thank each of you for your participation. I hope today’s presentation has provided you with a clear understanding of our achievements, our financial health, and confirmed our strategy direction going forward. Thank you once again for joining us today.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you.\nArno Monincx: Thank you.",

      "transcript": "Rutger Relker: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. It is my pleasure to welcome you to Aalberts Full Year Presentation for the year 2023. Live in our headquarter in Utrecht. My name is Rutger Relker, Director, Investor Relations. This past year, we welcomed Stephane Simonetta as our new CEO. Together with our CFO, Arno Monincx, we look forward to share our progress made with you today. Stephane will kick off the presentation with our strategy and objectives and give an update on our operational developments. This will be followed by Arno who will share our financial development, highlighting how our strategy has translated into a solid financial performance. Then, Stephane will give some color on 2024. After the presentation, we will give you the opportunity to engage directly with us in the Q&A session. Your questions and feedback are very important to us. And so we encourage you to participate. Later today, we will make the presentation and the recording of this webcast available on the website. Please welcome Stephane Simonetta to begin our presentation.\nStephane Simonetta: Welcome to all of you. It’s a true pleasure for me to be here today in our headquarter for the first time to present our full year result. But before going into the business update, let me pass two personal messages. First of all, I would like to say thank you, Wim, because the great performance we are delivering in 2023 has been also under the leadership of Wim until September when I took over. And the second personal note is to say thank you to all our employees for the great welcome I receive. So now I’ll be giving you three update. First of all, our strategy deployment. Second, it will be about our operational update. And third, it will be about our end market dynamics. But before going into the business update, let me start that there are still three macro trends that are impacting our future where we in Aalberts with our mission-critical technologies can help. It’s about urbanization, energy and resource scarcity, Internet of Things. And all of these three drivers are actually growth drivers for us. So, long-term growth agenda is still relevant for us. And you may wonder, what is the impact that we are making? And as I like to say, Aalberts is actually everywhere. We are in buildings, where we are helping installers save time and helping the building owner save energies. We are in microchips, where we are helping our customers with great innovation to ensure the world will have more and more chips as the world is getting more and more connected. And then we are in sustainable transportation, where we are helping our customers in automotive, in aerospace, in marine, reaching their decarbonization target, but also improving safety, reducing fuel consumption, and reducing manufacturing costs. When we talk about strategy, I just would like to come back to what actually we shared in the last Capital Markets Day. And we still have the same four strategic actions. So I will give you an update right now, one by one, where we are in our deployment, because for us, it’s all about strategy execution. And as you know, first of all, it’s about to continue to optimize our portfolio. Second, it’s about delivering revenue organic growth. Third, it’s about our operational excellence. And fourth, what we call in Aalberts, sustainable entrepreneurship. So let me share with all of you now an update on these four points. Regarding our portfolio optimization, as you know, over the last 2 years, we have been doing some acquisition and some divestment. Some great acquisitions around advanced mechatronic, around water treatment for heating systems, and some divestment where we believe we were not the best owner. And my promise to all of you is that we will continue this journey to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions, and at the same time to divest when we believe we are not the best owner of the companies. Secondly, when we talk about organic growth, the way we want to do it with more and more innovation. And I just would like to share with you on this slide, four good examples of innovations, where we are helping to distribute water, where we are helping to save energies, where we are helping to innovate with breakthrough technologies of improving the material lifetime or the material characteristic of the components. This is a great enabler to continue to sustain organic growth, thanks to our innovation of business development. But organic growth, it’s also the way we continue to focus on our four end market. And I’m pleased to share with you an update that you can see on this slide. First of all, the split according to our 4 end markets. And you may see that we are continuing to be strong on eco-friendly building with roughly half of our revenue. But you may notice that the semicon efficiency is now 14%. And we have moved from 6% to 14% over a few years, just showing the portfolio transformation that has been happening over the years. And now we have a much more balanced portfolio between our industrial part and our building part. Now looking at the regional split, we continue to be very strong in West Europe, being also growing in Americas. But for me, the takeaway is that we can still do much more in the Americas, and this is where we will continue also to invest. But you may wonder that on the geographical side what are the differences between building and industry. So let me give you an update now by business segment. What you can see on this slide is actually that on building, we are also well balanced from a geographical point of view. We are still very strong in West Europe. But as you see, we have also good position in Americas and East Europe. And this is actually important to us because we see different markets dynamics. Sometimes West Europe, it’s more slowing down. We see now some challenge on the new construction build. Renovation is still a question mark, but we see growth opportunity in the U.S. and in East Europe. So more balanced portfolio. Now, on the industrial side, you will see that we are really with a major share on the, in Europe. But this is simply because we follow our customers, and our footprint is always close to our customers. You can imagine that in service, in surface technologies, you need to be close to our customers. That’s why we are so much present in Europe, and that in our semicon efficiency, we are also delivering our customers who are mostly present in Europe. And we continue, wherever our customer goes, we will continue to move our footprint in Europe or in Asia, should they decide to move there. And talking about footprint, you know we have increased our CapEx, our investment to support organic growth, to support demand increase. And I would like to show you some great examples of some of the world-class operations that we are building. Some of these buildings, some of these factories, have been recognized as the most sustainable buildings in the world. We are investing in semicon efficiency. We are investing in buildings in Europe, and also in North America to also support geographical expansions. And we will continue to invest in additional capacity because this is about the long-term, not about short-term dynamic. And we remain confident for the long-term. The last point about the strategy update, as you know, is what we call sustainable entrepreneurship. And I’m really pleased to report to all of you that we have already reached our 70% target in 2023. And now the challenge is on us to sustain this performance year-after-year. As you know, our business is closely linked to 4 of the sustainable development goals. It’s about moving and distributing water, saving energy, innovating breakthrough technologies, and also improving the lifetime of the materials. And you see the breakdown by sustainable development goals. As I said, we will continue to reach 70% or even do higher. And when we talk about the long-term, no change with our ambition. Once again, we want to be carbon neutral by 2050 or earlier. But let me point you on this slide, the key highlight is our 2023 improvement. We are already at minus 33% in our CO2 intensity compared to 2018. But I think the most important message is that in the coming year, in 2024, we will not only measure our Scope 3, we will start to disclose our progress on our Scope 3 emissions. So more to come in our annual report. And the good news is that it’s not only about us measuring ourselves. We are really pleased that the progress we have made over the years is actually recognized externally by some of these global standards or indexes, just showing that our improvements are also working and are being recognized. So great job by all our teams around the world. At the end, strategy actions need to be measured. And you know that we have six key objectives that we are shared in the last Capital Markets Day. So let me share with all of you where we are regarding our 2026 target. It’s all about organic growth. You have seen in our press release earlier today, we deliver 4.5%, so on track with our 4% to 6% 2026 target. We are now at 15.7% in EBITA, getting close to our target, 16% to 18%. Still some work to do, but improving slowly but surely. Regarding our ROSE, also improving. And this is also where we have still have some work to do to deliver the 18% to 20% range in the coming 2 years. And our innovation rate lacks the sustainability, actually. We already reached 20%. But now the goal is to sustain that year-after-year, because as you know, our innovation rate is based on the last 4 years’ revenue, all the innovation we have been doing. So this is why we will continue to invest in innovation for the coming years. Our SDG rate, as I mentioned, we are now on track, so we’ll continue to ensure we sustain that level. And our leverage ratio is actually quite good. We are much better than our long-term target, but I will let Arno say a few words about that in the financial update. So now, let’s talk about the operational development. How has been 2023? And I will be starting, of course, to talk about organic growth because we have actually managed well the headwinds in the building technology with an organic growth of minus 1.2%. But on the other hand, we continue to grow double digit in industry, in semiconductors, in transportation, and in all our industrial niches. The supply chain situation has improved in 2023. Of course, we see now new challenges in ‘24, but we have improved our service level and we have continued to drive operational excellence, to sustain our high-level margin and continue to improve our profitability. Fantastic job, once again, done by our teams in all our businesses. When you look at innovation, we are at 20%, but when we think about the long-term, we will continue to invest, to ensure we innovate, to differentiate, to continue to help some of our customer challenges, either in product, either in solutions, or either in services. And on sustainability, you will see in our annual report that we are making great progress on CO2 intensity, but also on waste management and also on circularity, together with our suppliers or sometimes with our customers. And you can count on us to continue to make an impact for the environment. So our Aalbert people did a fantastic job in 2023. And talking about people, as you know, in Aalberts, we say the Aalberts way, it’s about winning with people. But when we look at safety, when we look at last time injuries, we are improving, but this is not good enough. So we will continue to invest, to improve the safety of all our employees in our businesses. We will continue to focus on diversity, because focusing on diversity is also an enabler to improve performance, to drive innovation. We are pleased to have 32% of women in our leadership team, but we want to go even further. And investing in people, it’s about, of course, ensuring all our employees are motivated and satisfied. It’s also ensuring that we continue to develop all our employees. So we take feedback seriously. We got some good insights about what we are doing. And as you see, we have developed and trained more than 950 colleagues around the world. So count on us to continue to invest in all our people to ensure the long-term growth of the company. So the last part of my update before going to the financials, it’s our focus on end market. And when we talk about buildings, let me first start to say long-term, we still see growth driver. Because of buildings need simply to be more eco-friendly because all the buildings need actually to save energy. And this is where we have great solutions, either with our integrating piping solution or with our hydronic solutions. And in 2023, we have done actually quite a good job because all the lower demand, all the inventory reduction of our employees, all the new construction bill going down. We have been able to manage that thanks to our business development initiative, thanks to our sales growth, thanks to our also geographical expansion. So managing the headwinds has been done, I think, very well by our teams. And long-term, it’s still a growth agenda. Even if the new build is going down, renovation is more stable. And once again, as I shared earlier, the geographical dynamics are quite different between Europe or West Europe, which will likely more plateau, but still growth opportunity in the U.S. and in Poland. On the semicon efficiency, it’s still a growth agenda. Let’s make it very short and let’s make it very clear because the world will need more and more chips because our customers are asking us to ramp-up capacity. We have done a great job to improve our service level, more on-time delivery to our customers. And we still see positive trend on the transportation side with a decarbonization coming up from the automotive, from aerospace, also from the marine, where we are supplying some of the biggest other car maker, plane makers, or ship builders. So at the end, different dynamic where we are I think doing a good job thanks to our mission-critical technology or thanks to our unique innovation and business development plan. Talking about sustainable transportation, as I just mentioned, the industry is going through a major transformation. And this is where we see also mix picture. Maybe sometimes some industries are going down but there is always opportunity for us. And even if sometimes there are some change, right, between electrification and more combustible engine, we are actually quite resilient because we can support both and we have the technology and the services to support actually any mix of change even of course we all hope that the decarbonization will accelerate in order to get moving all the things around the world. And in the industrial niche, we actually see a growth in all the region. This is, of course, sometimes very small business, but this is where sometimes also we are the only one to be able to provide this unique technology in some of the industrial place, in some of the agriculture. Sometimes it’s also about defense. So this is actually doing quite well. And our team did a great job in 2023. So let me wrap it up before I hand it over now to Arno about the financials. You have seen that we are still in strategy deployment mode and are well on track for 2026. You have seen that on the operational side, we have managed some of the headwind quite well, but we are still growing in industry. And that regarding the end market, we still see also a more balanced agenda. Thank you very much. Now let’s go to the financials with Arno.\nArno Monincx: Thank you, Stephane, and also welcome from my side, of course, to this webcast where I will take you through the financial development of Aalberts over 2023. And we start with the highlights where we see that our revenue grew with 3%, which was organically 4.5%. And as Stephane already mentioned, there was a clear organic growth in industrial technology, but also a small decline in building technology still facing headwinds. Nevertheless, we sustained our added value. And I think that is a great performance because first of all, as you may remember, in 2022, we build up our inventories because all the supply chain issues we face at that moment to secure our deliveries to the customers. But this year, 2023, we really reduced our inventories again. So nevertheless, with a solid pricing and also purchase saving initiatives, we managed to sustain our added value, a very good performance of our teams. EBITA, we increased 4%, €521 million towards a margin of 15.7%. Free cash flow, of course, record level when we reduced our inventories, I will come back to that later. But that resulted also in a very strong free cash flow performance. But also, CapEx increased again. Actually, also a record level, €224 million of CapEx spent, which is constantly investing in the future, in the business development programs, in the expansions of our company. And then last but not least, despite all these numbers, we also improved our ROCE again from 16.1% last year towards 16.8% this year. And last but not least, innovation rate increased towards 20%. And SDG rate, as also Stephane already mentioned, improved to 70%. So Albert’s delivered in 2023 a record EBITA and a record free cash flow. Then the revenue bridge about the revenue development in 2023, from the basis of 2022, we added €39.8 million from our acquisitions that we did. At the same time, we also lost €46.1 million from the divestments that we did. Then the currency impact versus the positive impact we had in 2022, we now face a negative impact of €36.7 million in 2023, mainly caused by the U.S. dollar. And that results then in organic revenue growth, as mentioned, 4.5% of €137 million towards the €3.324 billion revenue in 2023. EBITA bridge, the same, started from the €500.3 million of 2022. We added from our acquisitions €7.1 million, almost flatting out with the divestments, where we lost €6.7 million. And then the currency impact also in the EBITA, negative €5.5 million versus a positive effect loss in 2022. And then last but not least, the organic increase of EBITA €25.8 million totalizing towards the €521 million in 2023, being 15.7%. Then the EPS bridge. We started with the €3.37 of 2022, where we added from our acquisitions €0.06, but also the same we lost with our divestments, so that is a neutral effect. And then you also see the organic increase of €0.24, but also that also our company, even with a very strong balance sheet, is facing higher finance costs with an increased interest rate, and that is costing €0.17. Then besides that, also some high effective tax rate of €0.02 and of course also here the currency impact. So at the end, we managed to increase our EPS, but only with €0.01. The consolidated income statement, clearly, you see here the 2 years next to each other. EBITDA finished at 19.9% in 2023, which was also 30 basis points better than last year. You see also the increase of depreciation, which is of course logic with the increased CapEx programs that we are executing already for quite some time now. Then the EBITA improvements, and here also the net finance cost being €18.6 million higher than last year, despite a very good cash flow, despite, I come to that later, a very good net debt position. Income tax expense more or less the same, and at the end, that results in €3.38 versus €3.37 last year. A strong and resilient performance. The balance sheet, equity position over 60%, 60.8% solvability, very strong. But also, here you see that the net debt decreased from almost €800 million in 2022 towards €583 million in 2023, which brings the leverage ratio down from 1.3 in 2022 to 0.9 in 2023. Working capital improvement, one of the drives, of course, also for the strong cash flow. And at the end, the return on capital employed increased towards 16.8%. It’s a strong financial position, and we are ready with this balance sheet also to accelerate our growth agenda. Free cash flow. EBITDA, €29 million higher than last year. Good performance. Also, here you see the gain on disposal of subsidiaries, where we are a little bit lower than last year, €4.4 million. On the other side, we had some sale of equipment where we were a little bit higher than last year. These 2 years, quite comparable as you can see. And what we do, as always, and I also wrote it in our financial development in press release, we are investing these disposal gains towards improvement of our company in operational excellence initiatives, which we also did this year. And again, the net effect of these 2 years is more or less the same. Then change in provisions and changes in provision exceptional. That’s an important line. Also, as you may remember, in 2021, we took an exceptional cost for our operational excellence program at that time, and we finished the year 2021 with a provision on the balance sheet of €12.5 million, which were the costs that we already booked in our profit and loss account, but on the same time did not yet spend as cash out. Now you can see here over the 2 years, 2022 and 2023, how this €12.5 million was going into the cash flow statement. And at the end of 2023, also deadline is at zero in our balance sheet. So no exceptional costs anymore provided for in the balance sheet. Then change in working capital, there you see really the big improvement in free cash flow versus the negative €243 million last year, we managed even to realize a positive change in working capital of about €10 million. That gives the strong cash flow from ops, of yes, €276 million higher than 2022. And then we still also spent a record number of cash out for our investments, for our CapEx, €30 million higher than last year. Some purchases of intangibles a little bit higher and the proceeds from the sales equipment resulting in our free cash flow of €423 million versus €168 million last year, a very good performance. Our segment reporting, here we are reporting our financials in two segments, but you also see how our technology clusters are representing these two segments. So hydronic flow control, integrated piping systems are representing the building technology part, and advanced mechatronics and surface technologies are representing the industrial technology part. And here you see also the reporting per business segment. Building, we faced headwinds. We faced headwinds. And also, what you see here is the organic revenue growth finished negative at 1.2%. It’s also very clear that the volume reduction that we faced in the first half year was less in the second half year. And that’s also why you see that the EBITA margin full year of 14.3% is better than the 14.0% that we report in the first half year of 2023. So clearly, we see also the trend that the volume reduction has reduced. Still, of course, lower than what we would like and therefore still we believe in the long-term perspective of this business with all the renovations that are ongoing in the future. Industrial technology, very solid performance. We made an organic revenue growth of 12.4% and an EBITA improvement even versus the very good year 2022 of 17.7% in 2023. Also from a CapEx perspective, you see that we are investing heavily also in this segment with a lot of, yes, footprint expansion, but also business development and innovation plans to be executed. The dividend, we are proposing a cash dividend of €1.13 per share, which is €0.02 higher than last year. And also over the last 10 years, you see our CAGR of over 11%, which we believe is a very good value contribution for our shareholders. A proven sustainable business model, that is what Aalberts is about. And that is what you also see here during our history. We constantly manage with headwinds, with good markets, with slower markets. We are always able to perform in a good way. And that is what you see in this result. At the end, we finished higher, better than last year in a difficult year again. The shareholder value creation, our track record, earnings per share over the last 10 years, a CAGR of more than 9%, €1.38 in 2013, €3.38 in 2023. At the same time, the dividend per share is increasing even more, more than 11%, so that means also, as you may know, over the last 5 years, we increased also our pay ratio from 30% to 33%. Return on incremental capital employed, a very important indicator, how we are allocating our capital and how successful we are with that. Now, over the last 10 years, we managed to increase our EBITA with €294 million against an increase of capital employed, and this is including CapEx, of course, but also goodwill of acquisitions. €1.409 billion extra capital employed, which means over the last 10 years, 20.9% return on incremental capital employed. And this is an important indicator also for our ROCE on a yearly basis, of course. So as long as this percentage is above 20%, we are moving towards this 18% to 20% objective that we have in 2026. And yes, we are happy with our stable long-term shareholders who believe that we are creating value for them. A proven sustainable business model. And that brings me to Stephane again, who will give his perspective towards 2024. Thank you.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you, Arno. I’m sure you have seen our strong financial performance. But of course, this was 2023. Let me now share a few of my perspective looking forward for 2024. First of all, starting by the market. We see different markets dynamic by geography, by end markets. And when we start at the buildings, we see most likely that Europe, West Europe, will plateau. But on the other hand, we still see growth opportunity in the U.S. and in East Europe. So more balanced pictures. On the industrial side, it’s always, and the growth agenda will continue, short-term and long-term. Of course, the question is, are we going to see the same double-digit growth in 2024 and 2023? But let’s not forget that long-term we need to invest. We have a very strong order book in our semicon efficiency, and we still see opportunity also with geographical expansion in our surface technology business. In capital allocation, you have seen our strong balance sheet, you have seen our strong cash position. So we are ready to do bolt-on acquisitions, but also potentially to do more divestments according to our four end markets and according to our strategies. And we will continue to improve on sustainable entrepreneurship. And the key highlight of 2024 is that we will start to disclose our Scope 3 emission, but continue also to improve our waste management and also do even more on circularity. More to come in our next annual result in our annual report, where we’ll disclose some of the progress and what we plan to do in 2024. So when I look at 2024, our portfolio is actually quite balanced and we are ready to manage some of the headwinds and still having some growth opportunity to manage these headwinds. And the outlook, I have only two key message to pass to you. We will continue to deploy our strategy. We still have some work to do to reach all our objective in 2026, but we will continue with our four key strategic action. Continue to optimize our portfolio, focus on organic growth with great innovation, with additional investment and with geographical footprint, drive operational excellence, continue to optimize our footprint, but do even more on internal efficiencies and productivities. And we still have some opportunity also on inventory management to go even below and have a better mix in our inventories. And we will not stop on sustainable entrepreneurship. Because at the end, I think what is important for me, and I know for all our colleagues, is that Aalberts has a key role to play. Aalberts is everywhere. We are where technology matters. And since 1975, we have been engineering mission-critical technologies to enable clean, smart, and responsible future. And we will not stop here. You can count on us to do all we can to make not only a positive impact, but also a lasting impact. So before going to the Q&A session, I just would like to say thank you for watching, but also a huge thank you to all our shareholders for their trust and their loyalties. Also, a thank you to all our customers for their business and sometimes for their patience as we have still have some delivery or service challenges. But fantastic, thank you, and congratulations to all our Aalberts colleagues, we did an outstanding job to deliver a strong and resilient year in 2023. Thank you very much.\nA - Rutger Relker: [Operator Instructions] I would now like to give the word to David Kerstens from Jefferies for the first questions. Good morning. David.\nDavid Kerstens: Good morning, Rutger. Thank you very much for taking my questions. And well done on the resilient performance. I will ask – I’ve got three questions. I will ask them one by one. First of all, can you please explain the volume and pricing dynamics in the second half of the year? As it seems, pricing got a bit weaker towards the end of the year, while volume momentum picked up. And what are the implications of that for 2024, please?\nArno Monincx: Yes. Let’s say, as you know, David, thank you for your question. Yes. We managed, especially in the Q4 2022, we made our bigger price increases. And in 2023, the pricing initiatives were rather limited. So the pricing effect is really going down automatically during the year. So as we have said in the first half year, we still assume the pricing impact of 7% for Aalberts in total. And in the full year, we are assuming a 4.5% pricing effect for Aalberts in total, which makes automatically if you calculate that to your – in your numbers that the volume impact in the second half of the year was more positive than in the first half of the year. Especially also in the building side. So the building technology segment reduced quite a bit volume in the first 6 months. And in the second 6 months, we saw clearly there that the reduction was slowing down.\nDavid Kerstens: Yes, understood. And based on that, resilient performance in volume, your margins were relatively more stable. Is that the key driver in building technology in the second half of the year, while you managed to keep margins at 14.5%? And can you please also elaborate on the outlook for building technology in a bit more detail with regards to new builds and renovation? When do you expect markets will be strong enough for a return to positive volume growth supported by easy comps after last year’s destocking and a recovery of margins?\nStephane Simonetta: Maybe I can take this one, right? And Arno...\nArno Monincx: Of course.\nStephane Simonetta: You can add, of course, I know, right. You are right to say 2024 will definitely be more challenging because there are still many uncertainties and the dynamics are quite different by geography but also by end market. If we take West Europe, we all see the new construction bills going down our plateau while renovation is still a question mark. So that could be some of the headwinds. But on the other hand, I think I mentioned it earlier, we still see organic growth opportunities in the U.S. and in East Europe, where also on buildings, talking to our customers, talking to our partners, there is more confidence. So it will be a challenging year, but with a different, I think, dynamic based on the geographical split on the building technology side.\nArno Monincx: And let’s say again, David, what we saw in 2023 is that the reduction of volume decline of building also had some positive impact in the EBITA performance of building technology as such. So from 14.0% in the first 6 months, we increased to 14.5% in the second 6 months. And as you may always count on also on our teams, they did a great job also to, of course, take all kinds of actions in cost. And when your top-line is under pressure, you have to anticipate to that. So everybody did a great job there to protect as much as possible their margin, which was at the end resulting even in an improvement in the second half year.\nStephane Simonetta: And I think on when it will get up, it’s a very good question, David, because we, as you know, our customers have reduced a lot their inventories, right. So the inventories are at a very low level. And I think we cannot imagine that it will go even lower, right. We do not know, of course, what our customers are planning, but now it’s more what is going in is getting out. And the question mark is when the wholesaler or customers are going to get back on their stocking profile. And that’s a big question mark. It could happen in the second half, but today, we don’t know enough. So we just know the inventory are lows and we cannot imagine that they will go even lower.\nDavid Kerstens: Thank you. That’s great. And maybe a final question on semicon efficiency has now increased to 14% of revenue. Can you elaborate on the growth drivers going forward? And do you see any impact from the hype around artificial intelligence driving ASML and NVIDIA currently?\nStephane Simonetta: I think like I mentioned, David, long-term is just a growth agenda, right. And there may be, of course, different growth dynamics year-over-year. But we are now building factories. We are investing capacity for 2027, ‘28 and beyond. Our order book is at a very strong level on semicon efficiency. And we still get, of course, a lot of pressure for our customers to ensure ability and supply. That’s what is I think the top priority right now. But at the same time, we are looking also at new business opportunity with new innovation. And let’s not forget that when we talk about bolt-on acquisition, there are still also potentially opportunities to increase our portfolio and continue to add mission-critical technology to serve our customers in the semicon industries.\nDavid Kerstens: Great. Thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, David. I would now like to give the word to Chase Coughlan from Van Lanschot Kempen, who is in the line. So Chase? Chase has left. So Luuk Van Beek from the Degroof Petercam. Please welcome this morning.\nLuuk Van Beek: Yes. Good morning. I have two questions. The first one is on acquisition plans you mentioned that you have a very strong balance sheet which you obviously do. And that you wouldn’t want to use it for a bolt-on acquisition, but if I look at the diversification opportunities and the growth opportunities especially, [Technical Difficulty] would you also consider to do bigger acquisitions to really make a step forward there in terms of your offering in those areas?\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you for the question. I’m not sure I got the beginning of your question about divestment, but I think I understood the question on big acquisition. We – as I mentioned, we are in strategy deployment mode. Our current strategy is to do bolt-on acquisition. I think in our Capital Markets Day, we even put some amount about the size we are ready, so today to make huge acquisition is not part of our current strategy, right, so we will continue to do bolt-on acquisition mostly around our advanced mechatronics like we have been doing, mostly around our hydronic flow control business, and also around the USA, this is where we will be looking at, but not major and still bolt-on acquisition. According to the, I think frame, we disclosed in the last Capital Markets Day.\nArno Monincx: We remain very disciplined in our capital allocation, Luuk.\nLuuk Van Beek: You have some – such a strong balance sheet, if it continues like this, it could become under leveraged. So that’s, I was wondering what you want to do then, if that happens?\nArno Monincx: Let’s say what we said, we are ready again to make acquisitions. As you know, last year, with the transition of leadership, clearly there we took a break in acquisitions, which I think makes sense. And now, with Stephane being on board again, we are ready to do so. So you may expect acquisitions in 2024.\nLuuk Van Beek: And I have a question on the industrial markets. If you can give a bit more color on the various parts because take for example, sustainable transportation. There are quite some things moving like, on the one hand, automotive manufacturers are becoming more hesitant on growing in electric vehicles. On the other hand, I think Airbus is growing at the expense of Boeing, which could be favorable for you. So can you give a bit more color of all the developments that you see there, the main ones?\nStephane Simonetta: Yes. I think it’s a great question. And you are right that automotive could be more challenging, right, as we see different dynamics. But we see actually super strong growth on aerospace, on marine, and some other industry segments. Because we have some technologies which are unique. And this is helping some of our customers. And we do not always supply directly the airplane manufacturer, while sometimes we are more the Tier 2. So we supply Tier 1 that are supplying Airbus or Boeing. And here it’s about growth agenda. We have also strong order book. We are expanding our capacity to continue to deliver some unique components. Because we are helping our customers to reduce fuel, to reduce cost, to improve safety. And on automotive, we are actually quite agnostic about the technology. Of course, we all hope that the automotive will continue the transformation on decarbonization. But either it’s more EV or more combustion engine. For us, that does not have a significant impact regarding our growth trajectory. Right. Of course, if the economy and there is less car being produced, that will have an impact on us. But the switch is actually less critical for us in the way we do all our surface treatment, all our material and characteristics.\nLuuk Van Beek: Okay, that’s clear. Thank you. \nRutger Relker: [Operator Instructions] Well, we are waiting for possible more live questions. I also see already some questions coming in. I think now, let me see. Yes, Martijn den Drijver, ABN AMRO. Good morning, Martijn.\nMartijn den Drijver: Good morning, gentlemen. From the snowy slopes of Tignes Val d'Isère.\nStephane Simonetta: Good place.\nMartijn den Drijver: I have a question and it continues to build on one that my colleague from Jeffries also asked. You previously mentioned in, when talking about semicon 2024, perhaps low to mid-single digit organic growth. But since then, we’ve had ASML with very strong order intake and indeed there’s the AI hype. So is that still slightly cautious remark about growth? Has that now been – has that changed basically? Are you now probably, are you perhaps now sensing that there could be an acceleration in the second half based on that improvement in the front end? That would be question one.\nStephane Simonetta: I can only say we don’t want to change what we said last time. We are still very cautious, right. We still see a growth agenda, but I think it’s too soon to change what we shared with you last time regarding the outlook for 2024. I think that will be my short and simple answer. So not yet.\nMartijn den Drijver: Got it. And then secondly, you mentioned in the press release that the savings from, excuse me, that the Disptek gain will be used for operational excellence. Can you elaborate a little bit on what you mean by that? Is that an acceleration of the operational excellence program? And if so, what kind of savings can or should we expect from that investment between brackets?\nArno Monincx: Let’s say like we always do, as you know, Martijn, we are investing our disposal gains towards operational excellence initiatives. And also, let’s say in 2023, we did between €15 million and €20 million of operational access initiatives with a payback of 2 years to 3 years. So that will for sure help also in ‘24 and onwards to improve our profitability. Besides, of course, we always have one offs as we have always. So the total net effect. And that is also important to understand our numbers. As you can see in the holding eliminations there, you see that the total costs have increased of holding eliminations. And that is really the – let’s say effect of higher holding and holding costs, not of higher or lower disposal benefits, because they are yes, spot on equal last year and this year.\nMartijn den Drijver: Thanks, Arno for getting feedbacks element. Because I was indeed wondering how that works, because we have a €30 million on Disptek, which means you have €90 million of other income, insurance payouts, subsidies, grants to get to €49 million of other income you reported for the year. You have maybe €9 million to €10 million of regular holding corporate costs, and you reported €5 million negatives. That leaves an unexplained delta of roughly €45 million. Should I see that €45 million as the investment in these cost savings or in this operational excellence program? Is that the way I should look at it?\nArno Monincx: On the other operating income is €49 million, as you say. And that is including, of course, let’s say the disposal benefits and the and of course, also the operational excellence initiatives that takes OpEx. So that is then causing the higher OpEx lines, which you cannot identify on the P&L. So therefore, we always explain, as we did also in previous years, the real incidental effect in our holding/elimination line, because as we have always been doing, the operational results in our segments are operational and clean, and we take all the exceptional benefits and costs in our holding/elimination line. So, let’s say the other operating income is in line, I would say a little bit lower than last year, it’s €5 million lower, but it’s also depending on the extra cost that we make, how the impact will be for the profitability, so there is no difference with last year.\nMartijn den Drijver: Now, the key one is that there is no one-off in the operational EBITA per division. Okay, clear. And then…\nArno Monincx: There as a one-off effect, but it’s par with last year, so it’s approximately €5 million last year and this year.\nMartijn den Drijver: Yes, but you mentioned that’s on the holding line. None of that impacts the divisional EBITA.\nArno Monincx: No.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. Moving on, you mentioned quite a number of elements that have supported the value-add and specifically in building tech, the EBITA margins. What you don’t talk about is the procurement savings, is there anything that you are willing to share of what that might contribute in 2024, because that was…?\nStephane Simonetta: I think I can take this one. Thanks for asking. And of course, this is where I think we are more positive regarding material costs management because we see the price of material getting down, more and more availability from our suppliers. So, our purchasing team are working on a very aggressive plan to sustain our margin. So, this is where, and it can be sometimes single or even double digit material cost saving that we see in 2024. So, more opportunities definitely compared to 2023.\nMartijn den Drijver: Okay. That’s clear. And one final question, basically on the same subject. So, raw mats probably moving in a favorable direction. How about energy, is that also coming your way in 2024 relative to 2023?\nArno Monincx: A little bit more difficult to predict, of course. But as it looks right now, it is also going down a bit, the effect. But we don’t know how that looks like in two months, three months, as you know.\nMartijn den Drijver: Yes. We know them, but looking at it. Okay. Those are my question so far. Thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Martijn. I would now like to give the word to Maarten Verbeek from The IDEA. Good morning Maarten.\nMaarten Verbeek: Good morning all and thank you. A couple of questions from my end, please. As you stated, you made some good progress with your working capital, but you are still not within your targeted range. Do you believe you could be in that range at year end, or do you believe it will take a bit longer before you will be in that range, so that would be in 2025?\nArno Monincx: Now, what I explained at the end of 2022 is that we of course, made a steep increase in inventories to secure our delivery performance towards the customers with all these supply chain issues, and that we were aiming to go back to the normal level of, let’s say, before 2022, which is ‘21, in about 2 years. Now, I think we made a big step forward in that direction. It’s only a few days away from where we were at 2021. But of course, we will continue to further improve and optimize also our inventories to even a better level, so that is work in progress.\nMaarten Verbeek: Okay. Thank you. In the first half, you were facing some underutilization, particularly in that building. Do you still expect that to occur in this fiscal year?\nArno Monincx: Let’s say for as long as the volumes remain on the level where it is today, you could expect that is the same. But we don’t know exactly how this will look like. But as you can see in 2023, we managed well the headwinds. But of course, underutilizing a bit leading to a lower EBITA performance as the year before, that’s clear. So, yes, we will do our utmost to protect our margin also going forward. That’s just how we are doing the business.\nStephane Simonetta: That’s also one of the key priority going forward and there are operational excellence, strategic initiative, to focus more on higher utilization of our assets, doing leaner investments, continue to support the growth, but with better footprint optimization and better capacity utilization. Especially on the building side, I think this is where we have challenges, but also opportunities.\nMaarten Verbeek: And lastly, could you share with us what you expect to spend on capital expenditure this year?\nArno Monincx: Yes. Let’s say, as we also have guided, I think already in the Capital Markets Day in ‘21, it will be some higher years of CapEx. Now, like we said last year, €200 million, €250 million, I think we were quite spot on and that we expect at least the same also for 2024. So, there is a lot of projects, yes, also with a longer lead time than only 1 year, so we are continuing to invest also in 2024. So, €200 million, €250 million, you should take into account.\nMaarten Verbeek: Okay. Thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Maarten. I think now Ruben Devos from Kepler Cheuvreux. Good morning Ruben.\nRuben Devos: Yes. Good morning everyone. Thanks for letting me on. I actually have a first question related to semicon. I believe you talked about investing for capacity for ‘27, ‘28. You already realized €460 million in the semicom division. So, if you are preparing already for ‘27, ‘28, could you give some degree of how much capacity you are actually planning for, rough order of magnitude? Are you looking for maybe a high €100 million range, what should we be thinking of?\nStephane Simonetta: Yes, that’s – it’s difficult to, I think to predict. The order book is high. We are investing, and I think we have a good view on the coming 2 years, 3 years, but I will hate to give you numbers at this period of time, because I think it’s still more a range. We still see growth long-term. I will say, if you look at long-term, it’s high-single digit or low-double digit. That’s what we see long-term on the semicon industry, right. But to give you a number, I think that will be a bit premature at this point of time.\nArno Monincx: And as Stephane said, we also have an acquisition focus in this area. So, you may assume the increase of share in the total, that will continue, so.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And then thinking about, like obviously, we have seen a very positive news flake coming out from the semi-equipment space and also from AI, etcetera. How, like if you look at your major buying customers, ASML, ASM, KLA, and so on, is there any like other end markets that you are paying more attention to in terms of your systems are thinking, the vibration isolation systems, the high purity fluid systems, are they more penetrated in some specific segments, like logical memory, where you are more penetrated with your subsystems?\nStephane Simonetta: I think it’s a great question and that’s also very high in our agenda for the next strategy period. So, in the current strategy period, it’s still around the same, I think go-to-market or service to our customers. So, doing a few bolt-on acquisitions to increase our portfolio to deliver our current customers in this highly sophisticated equipment. Maybe also looking more at services, that’s what we are looking at, helping our customers also on their circular request. And then for the next strategy period, that will be something we will need to decide, do we want to expand, and be more front-end or more downstream in the value chain of the semiconductor industry, or do we want to stay here more upstream. So, good question, but I think very relevant for the next strategy period. So, count on us to be back when we will have made the decision, because then it will be the time for a new Capital Markets Day, sharing what we want to do beyond our current scope.\nRuben Devos: Alright. Thank you. And then just a final question on let’s say the margins, I think you sort of have that target objective of 25% drop through rate. I think it was 21%, 22% in ‘23 and up, but obviously you have had a bit more of challenges in the Building segment. I think you are also talking about a bit of a challenge here in ‘24, but you also talked about potentially strong savings in terms of raw material procurement. Is it fair to say maybe in ‘24 you would still be trending below that, let’s say, objective of 25%, but then once, obviously, you get higher utilization in the Building segment, then you see, renovation activity, new build activity that you would be turning ahead of that?\nArno Monincx: Now, let’s say that is really depending from the fact if we can really make volume growth again in building, because as you have calculated probably yourself, we made 19% drop-through in 2023 in total, clearly with a very good drop-through performance of industrial business and yes, even a negative drop of building with a volume decline that is logic. So, yes, let’s say, I expect because we saw already the improvements in the second half of the year, that that is also clearly what you can see in the EBITA performance. I expect that we can grow also drop-through again for building if we are able to make volume growth again. And that is clearly, of course, what is not yet so clear at this moment.\nRuben Devos: Okay. And the idea is still that maybe within industrial that it’s more straightforward to have that higher drop through for the surface treatment business as opposed to the semicon, or is it rather the same level?\nArno Monincx: Let’s say, clearly, the service technology business has a higher EBITA performance than the semicon business at this moment. But the semicon is still growing, also that has all impact on the EBITA performance. But at the end, they both do a very good performance, but semicon is even on the higher side.\nRuben Devos: Alright. Thank you very much.\nArno Monincx: Sorry, semicon. I said semicon, but I mean service technologies, yes.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Ruben. Now, I would like to give the word to Aurelio Calderon from Morgan Stanley. Good morning Aurelio.\nAurelio Calderon: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have got two, please. The first one is around what we talked about, the building blocks for pricing this year, ‘23, or sorry, last year in ‘23. Can we talk about what happens in ‘24, how you see, because you have talked about raw materials coming down, you talked about energy prices probably coming down. So, I am just wondering if you are seeing more pressure from your customers to take prices down, or you will do whatever it takes to at least protect prices. And that will be the first one, please.\nStephane Simonetta: I think, thank you, Aurelio for the great question. You are absolutely right. We – of course, we see many of our peers or other companies going massively on price reduction to get more volumes. But that’s not our strategy, right. There will be always someone cheaper than us, and we don’t want to go to this trend. So, we believe in our innovation, we believe in our differentiation, and we believe in our unique offering, right. So, now, of course it will be more challenging to push price increase in ‘24 than in 2023. But we still want to continue. And the price increase may be lower than in ‘23. But we are determined and I know our team are working very hard to manage because it’s, we still have sometimes some commodities on some part of our business, where we still see price increase also in our own value chain. So, we can’t also on this to pass to our customers. So, back to your question, yes, we see the pressure, right. But yes also, we will do all we can to continue to pass even modest price increase on our Building Technology segment.\nArno Monincx: And purchase saving initiatives, there is also now the supply chain, let’s say, availability has normalized again. We put much more focus again on our purchase saving initiatives. And I think also there we make progress.\nAurelio Calderon: That’s great. Thank you. And the second question is around market share. You talked about, I think it’s for the Building segment, but you talked about market share gains. And I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on how you are gaining market share? Is it because of innovation? Is it because of availability? And what are the drivers between market share gains? And if you can also touch on what you have seen in terms of market share developments in the other verticals would be helpful as well.\nStephane Simonetta: Yes, that’s a very good question. And sometimes it’s very painful, but sometimes it’s also, it’s a great opportunity because you are absolutely right. First of all, it’s about availability, right. And now, I think with the supply chain improvement, if I look at West Europe, even at the beginning of the year, we are doing quite a great job because we have super good availabilities. Our factories are delivering. We have our distribution center full, and we can offer short lead time. And now, many of our customers and wholesalers actually want our product, based on the best-in-class quality, based on the best services, and the long-term and reliability of our offerings. But of course, when we are not able to deliver, this is also becoming a challenge. And if I look at the Americas, this is where we have some opportunities to improve our service level for our customers and gain market share. So, it’s I would say availability in ‘24 could help us to manage some of the headwind, even if there is a global market demand. But I know in the U.S., we could gain market share with better service.\nAurelio Calderon: Yes. That’s great. Thank you very much.\nRutger Relker: If that’s your last question, Aurelio, thank you so much. Then I think it’s now time to go to some of the questions submitted via the webcast. And I will start with the first one here. Perhaps that’s a good one for Arno. It’s a question about the CapEx level after 2024, would it be more normative, would it go down?\nArno Monincx: Let’s say we have guided, of course, in the Capital Markets Day of 2021, that we increase our CapEx towards €200 million, €250 million. So, that will take until the end of this period. Nevertheless, of course, we expect in the short-term that we are on the high side of that because of all the big projects that are running. And besides late – perhaps later on, it will go down a bit, but we still see lots of growth potential opportunities to which we allocate our CapEx. And at the end, CapEx do have a very good return. So, it’s always accretive to our ROCE performance, which is also an important target for us to realize. So, yes, we see as far as long as we see allocate, as we see opportunities to make returns from our CapEx, we will continue to do so. And I think the guidance has been quite clear until 2026.\nStephane Simonetta: I will add, on top of what Arno said that, what you will see also is a change in mix of our CapEx. Less in buildings, because you are right, when the capacity will be there, we will be ready to grab the growth. And more in R&D, more in innovation, because we are quite good for the next 4 years, as on the business development we did, without 20%, but there are still many opportunities to innovate solutions for our customers. We still have some room with also the digitalization agenda. And this is where, within our frames, as we will be spending less in buildings in the coming years, we can spend more on R&D for the long-term growth agenda that we have.\nRutger Relker: Thank you, Stephane. There is another question about M&A. What would be your key priorities in M&A?\nStephane Simonetta: Yes, that’s – thank you. I think first of all, you know very well, right, I think better than me, that we have a very successful M&A playbook in Aalberts. We have been doing that for many years and we have been great at doing bolt-on acquisition of strategic agenda. We will continue to do that focusing on our four key end markets, right. That’s the strategic compass, right. And you can count on us to be very disciplined in this allocation. And I will just mention, like I have been sharing I think to some of our investors and shareholders over the last weeks, we have three key priorities in our M&A agenda, right. It’s about first of all, hydronic flow controls, because we see opportunities to continue to expand our portfolio. When you go in the boiler rooms, you see what we are doing with our expansion vessel, with our air-dirt separators. Now, we have also heat treatment for heating solutions, but we could also do more to do full solution package for the commercial buildings. So, that’s one element, but hydronic flow control is also in the U.S. where we are quite small. This is where also we believe, we will be much faster by doing some great acquisition to also enter the residential side in the U.S. So, number one, hydronic flow control. The second one, advanced mechatronics to continue what we started also with our semicon efficiency agenda. As you have seen over the last 2 years, we did some great add in our portfolio and we will continue to do that. But advanced mechatronics could be also a geographical expansion. I think I explained it that in this business, you need to be close to your customers. So, if our customers are also moving the assembly equipment in other part of the world, we will be following it. And then we may do also some acquisition in other parts of the world outside Europe for the semicon efficiency business. The last priority, in the U.S., because for me, it’s important that in the long-term, we have also an even more balanced portfolio between Europe and USA. And we also have a good recipe. We have done, I think a great job in surface technologies with all the acquisitions we have been doing. But I still see many growth opportunities in terms of acquisition for the North America market. So, I would say these are key priorities for the coming years.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. There is another question about inventory level. Perhaps that’s a good one for you, Arno. You have reduced – we have reduced the inventory position in 2023, could we expect some further reduction in 2024?\nArno Monincx: Yes, as I already explained, we made a big increase in 2022. And we said at that time that we will probably need more than 1 year to come back to the normal level again. I think in 2023, we improved 11 days, which is a good, yes, let’s say a big step forward towards the direction of before the spike in 2022. We are not there yet, still have a few days to improve. But you can count on us that we will constantly try to further optimize our inventory, because at the end its capital employed and we have to be sure that we are most efficient in our – also in our inventory allocation. So, we will continue to improve that also in the years to go.\nStephane Simonetta: And this is also, as Arno mentioned, through our operational excellence agenda, we can also improve the way we manage our flows in our supply chain, and this as a result could optimize the days on hand that we have in our value chain on inventories. So, maybe having even better availabilities for our customers especially in the building, but maybe more streamlining our work in progress and our raw materials on the inbound from our former suppliers, so definitely the answer is yes, we will improve.\nRutger Relker: Yes, thank you. And this is a perhaps a nice bridge to another question which came in, whether you could perhaps share some more details on operational excellence. Is this just footprint reduction, optimization, or what’s your view on that?\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you. I think also what we share, right, it’s definitely more than footprint, right. So, we – don’t get me wrong, we will execute the plan and deliver on the objective we shared in the last Capital Markets Day because we can have a more simple footprint and continue to reduce number of sites. But like I have said, it’s not about the number of sites, right. It’s about the efficiency you drive. It’s about higher CapEx utilization. Higher I think also, health and safety for our employees, and better flows in our supply chain. So, all of that, through technologies, I think we can still do more and reduce our cost to produce, as an example, especially in the buildings, because this is I think, where we have the hydronic and the repetitive. Then in semicon is to also continue even it’s more a project business. And then on the service, I think this is more a footprint because also here we need to ensure we have the right utilization of our big furnaces, a huge oven that we have in some part of the world. So, that’s for me, what I call the end-to-end operational excellence.\nRutger Relker: Thank you. Quite clear. I think that we can conclude the Q&A session. And as we conclude today’s webcast, I want to thank each of you for your participation. I hope today’s presentation has provided you with a clear understanding of our achievements, our financial health, and confirmed our strategy direction going forward. Thank you once again for joining us today.\nStephane Simonetta: Thank you.\nArno Monincx: Thank you.",

    "fullTranscript": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the AAMC Investor Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Danya Sawyer. Please go ahead.\nDanya Sawyer: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AAMC's Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Danya Sawyer, the Chief Operating Officer of Lending Operations at AAMC. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements made during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical in nature. As described under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K, forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ from its beliefs, expectations, estimates and projections. Consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Statements made during this conference call are made as of today's date, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. As previously mentioned, today's call is being recorded, and a link to this webcast will be posted to our website later today.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Charlie Frischer, member of our Board of Directors. Charlie?\nCharles Frischer: Thank you, Danya, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I will report on positive developments in our significant legal matters, provide an update on our Lending Operations and talk about a potential new investment opportunity we are considering for the company. In the preferred shareholder case in New York, in June, the Appellate Division ruled in AAMC's favor and held that we did not breach any contractual obligation to redeem Luxor's preferred shares. Luxor now seeks to take a second appeal, which we have opposed. We have also opposed a motion to dismiss our separate action in USVI Federal Court against Luxor Partner and former AAMC Director, Nathaniel Redleaf, alleging breach of fiduciary duty to AAMC. In a lawsuit against Blackrock and PIMCO in USVI Superior Court, AAMC status has been converted to party plaintiff. Last month, a Staff Master assigned by the court to review pending motions issued his recommendations. He concluded that the court should exercise jurisdiction over 4 of the 5 Blackrock entity defendants and both of the PIMCO defendants. The Staff Master also recommended that all of AAMC tort and CICO claims -- damage claims be permitted to proceed. The party's responses to the Staff Master's recommendations are due to be filed later this month. For detailed information regarding these matters, please refer to litigation disclosures contained in our second quarter 10-Q and prior public filings. Let me now turn to the company's Lending Operations. The Board of Directors is undertaking a comprehensive assessment to determine what can be done to improve the performance of this business to bring it in line with the expectations of the Board and our shareholders. Our fix and flip, construction and other lending programs have not achieved profitability as fast as initially anticipated. We are reviewing multiple initiatives to address operational capacity issues, reduce costs, improve liquidity and enhance overall performance. During the pendency of this review, which is ongoing, we are taking steps to move loans more quickly off our lines of credit. As we review our Lending business and as we continue our search for additional capital-light asset management businesses that could be accretive to our business and shareholder value, we want to report an interesting opportunity. We recently received a proposal regarding a new technology developed by an R&D venture led by AAMC shareholder, William Erbey. We invited Bill to join the call today to present this opportunity. As he will explain, this patented breakthrough technology is designed to substantially reduce energy loss and heat generation in electric vehicles, thereby increasing their range and efficiency. Given the enormous addressable EV market, these technology advances have significant upside potential. The opportunity is a pure intellectual property licensing play with low capital requirements. Structure and other details are still under discussion, but we have agreed in principle that the company's upfront cash commitment would be 0. The company's primary out-of-pocket expenses would be approximately $7 million to $8 million in working capital over the next 18 to 24 months. These amounts would be extended as the technology is positioned for full commercialization. There would be a stock-based earn-out and increments of 10% of company stock earned when our share price exceeds $100 and as the share climbs above each $100 threshold thereafter adjusted for appreciation attributed to lending. Any transactions would, of course, be subject to definitive contract documents and the presentation that Bill is going to give is also going to be placed upon onto our website. At this time, I invite Bill to present this technology. Bill?\nWilliam Erbey: Thank you, Charlie. Good afternoon. First, let me caveat this presentation by saying there are no guarantees that the [Alpha] Control System will be technologically or commercially successful and that all elements of the presentation represent our understanding at the present time. The principal challenge of electromotive vehicles is their lack of range, which is caused by electric motors having an eye of high efficiency or over a narrow range of torque and speed. Outside the eye of high efficiency, efficiency and range rapidly declined. Beginning in 2017, my concept is to utilize multiple motors with unique peak efficiencies at various torque and speed combinations throughout the drive cycle and engage those motors through our standard optimization algorithm, such as the most efficient motor or motors are always being utilized. We're using mathematics to solve a physical problem. Our test results indicate a 50% reduction in energy loss and heat generation and -- resulting in an 8% increase in range. The market for electromotive vehicles, cars, trucks, construction and mining equipment is large and rapidly growing. To penetrate the market, we are engaged with a world-class engineering team with outstanding industry contacts with the next steps being prototype development and commercialization. The two greatest challenges of electric vehicles are range and heat dissipation as corroborated by both Elon Musk and Peter Rawlinson, the CEO of Lucid Motors. The graph is one representation of the efficiency curve of an electric motor. There is a very narrow range of torque and speed where given electric motor is highly efficient. Outside that range, efficiency and hence range declined rapidly. The opportunity lies in selecting multiple electric motors having peak efficiencies at various combinations of torque and speed, combining multiple motors with a control system which optimizes motor selection, significantly enhances efficiency and range. The key point is the greater the variability in torque and speed, the greater the opportunity to increase efficiency with our patent. Alpha Controls owns 2 U.S. patents and 1 U.K. patent with additional patents pending. Our patents cover not only optimized motor selection under driving conditions for a given set of motors but also can be utilized to select the optimal combination of motors to be installed in a particular electromotive vehicle. We've completed the technical and commercial assessment with our partner, which covered patent evaluation, simulation, modeling and testing and commercial feasibility and value assessment. Simulation occurred at the University of Bath in England at the world renounced IAAPS Advanced Propulsion Center. The simulation concluded that for a Tesla Model 3, the patent technology will increase range by 8.4%. This can also have the significant impact on the environment, not only will the vehicle generate far less heat but to the extent fossil fuels are used to generate the electricity, less pollution, and again, less heat generated. Please keep in mind that these results are simulations granted with actual motors. However, ultimately results in terms of performance enhancement and value created may vary widely in commercial application. The commercial assessment by our partner concluded that for the Tesla Model 3, which represents 19% of Tesla sales that the value created under 3 business cases was between $105 million and $393 million per year. There is upside potential and range improvement. Current motor design is focused on single motor automotive use. The existing motors are very inefficient in low torque and speed conditions. Our partner is evaluating motors developed for other applications, which can be utilized as well as speaking with motor manufacturers to develop a motor specifically for this application. Our partner's preliminary evaluation of the IP is the total available market of $49.5 billion and a serviceable available market of $9.2 billion annually. Of course, these are any projections and should not be relied upon. Keep in mind, however, Alpha is a licensed model in a highly tax advantaged location. At scale, most revenue should translate into after-tax earnings. Early on, I recognized that I had neither the expertise nor the industry contacts to develop and commercialize the patent. Therefore, I sought out and was able to reach an agreement with one of the leading firms in the electromotive vehicles. It is the Alejandro Agag group of companies at the Formula E, the electric equivalent of Formula 1; the Extreme E, which is electric off-road racing; and E1, which is electric boat racing, along with SeaBird Technologies, which is responsible for motor development. Many of the same constructors have participated in Formula 1 participated in Formula E, Jaguar, McLaren, Maserati, Nissan and Porsche. Supporting SeaBird is purple sector led by Mark Mathieson and his team. Mark is a former Chief Engineer of Powertrain Research at McLaren Engineering. The next phase of the project is prototype development and commercialization, both Richard and Mark believe that developing a protocol will significantly increase our commercial returns. The prototype in commercialization are projected across between $7 million and $8 million and will require up to 18 months. The partner development contract demonstrates conviction in technology and commercial application by a world-class partner. SeaBird receives a 10% ownership in Alpha when revenues attributable to partner's efforts exceeds $500 million per year. Again, this is a licensing model. SeaBird is our exclusive worldwide distributor for 2 years, and we'll receive 10% of revenue up to $250 million and 20% of revenue over $250 million per annum. Thank you for your time.\nCharles Frischer: Thanks. That was really helpful, Bill. I hope people appreciated the presentation. At this time, we'd be happy to take questions on the Alpha technology presentation and also at the end of this, I'll have a few special comments for the folks on the call. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jeff Moore with [Borough] Capital.\nUnidentified Analyst: I'm curious, where is Jason? Is he on the call or...\nCharles Frischer: No, Jason is not on the call. Jason is working on our strategic review. And -- but we've had the decision to make that not have him on the call.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got you. Okay. Can you comment any on the -- I guess, the general status of the Lending Operations?\nCharles Frischer: Yes. We're not looking to take questions on the specifics of Lending Operations until our overall review is completed. I will tell you, Jeff, that it's just -- we are in this position because the Lending Operations, as you can see by our quarterly results, wasn't meeting our expectations, and we're being proactive in trying to make adjustments to make it profitable or to make the decision what to do with the operation in its entirety.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Well, thanks for being proactive about that. I think earlier you mentioned something about asset-light managers -- management services and stuff that you were looking at. And I may be misremembering that, but something to that effect, could you talk about that anything?\nCharles Frischer: Yes. I think, Jeff, the way we think about it is with the business that Bill presented, it's the ultimate asset-light business. The revenues will largely be licensing. We'll have no production. We will have no manufacturing really to speak of. And the vast majority of the revenue would drop down to the bottom line. So I think that really is a great example of what we're trying to do. So if you have one more question, Jeff?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Just one more and then I'll shut up. What's your commitment to the New York Stock Exchange listing? I know that the total market cap of the company, if I remember right, needs to be more than $50 million? It looks like after hours, you guys are about half that. What's your commitment to maintaining that listing and whatnot?\nCharles Frischer: Yes, I think we'll be proactive in maintaining -- taking best efforts to have a listing that's acceptable to shareholders.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have no further phone questions.\nCharles Frischer: Okay, operator. That's very helpful. I'd like to make a few final comments. First of all, thank you for joining us today. I would like to say that I've gotten to know Bill Erbey pretty well over the last few weeks and months, and I found him to be very smart, hard-working and with excellent judgment. I think having Bill involved with the company in the future will be a strong addition, and he will hopefully help create value for shareholders. As the largest shareholder with 45% ownership of the company, he has tremendous incentive to see the stock price move higher over time. I also look forward to providing more details regarding the review of the mortgage business over the next few months as we continue with the evaluation and improvements. I've also put my [indiscernible] information on the company's press release if folks have additional questions or comments. The Board is excited about the possibilities of the control system technology. No venture is without risk, but licensing IP assets designed to extend the range of electric vehicles to provide significant return to shareholders, if successful. We've also worked hard to create a potential acquisition with no cash consideration today and one that only earns a return for the seller if AAMC stock enjoys quite oversized returns. Thank you very much for your time today.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

      "transcript": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the AAMC Investor Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Danya Sawyer. Please go ahead.\nDanya Sawyer: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AAMC's Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Danya Sawyer, the Chief Operating Officer of Lending Operations at AAMC. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements made during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical in nature. As described under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K, forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ from its beliefs, expectations, estimates and projections. Consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Statements made during this conference call are made as of today's date, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. As previously mentioned, today's call is being recorded, and a link to this webcast will be posted to our website later today.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Charlie Frischer, member of our Board of Directors. Charlie?\nCharles Frischer: Thank you, Danya, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I will report on positive developments in our significant legal matters, provide an update on our Lending Operations and talk about a potential new investment opportunity we are considering for the company. In the preferred shareholder case in New York, in June, the Appellate Division ruled in AAMC's favor and held that we did not breach any contractual obligation to redeem Luxor's preferred shares. Luxor now seeks to take a second appeal, which we have opposed. We have also opposed a motion to dismiss our separate action in USVI Federal Court against Luxor Partner and former AAMC Director, Nathaniel Redleaf, alleging breach of fiduciary duty to AAMC. In a lawsuit against Blackrock and PIMCO in USVI Superior Court, AAMC status has been converted to party plaintiff. Last month, a Staff Master assigned by the court to review pending motions issued his recommendations. He concluded that the court should exercise jurisdiction over 4 of the 5 Blackrock entity defendants and both of the PIMCO defendants. The Staff Master also recommended that all of AAMC tort and CICO claims -- damage claims be permitted to proceed. The party's responses to the Staff Master's recommendations are due to be filed later this month. For detailed information regarding these matters, please refer to litigation disclosures contained in our second quarter 10-Q and prior public filings. Let me now turn to the company's Lending Operations. The Board of Directors is undertaking a comprehensive assessment to determine what can be done to improve the performance of this business to bring it in line with the expectations of the Board and our shareholders. Our fix and flip, construction and other lending programs have not achieved profitability as fast as initially anticipated. We are reviewing multiple initiatives to address operational capacity issues, reduce costs, improve liquidity and enhance overall performance. During the pendency of this review, which is ongoing, we are taking steps to move loans more quickly off our lines of credit. As we review our Lending business and as we continue our search for additional capital-light asset management businesses that could be accretive to our business and shareholder value, we want to report an interesting opportunity. We recently received a proposal regarding a new technology developed by an R&D venture led by AAMC shareholder, William Erbey. We invited Bill to join the call today to present this opportunity. As he will explain, this patented breakthrough technology is designed to substantially reduce energy loss and heat generation in electric vehicles, thereby increasing their range and efficiency. Given the enormous addressable EV market, these technology advances have significant upside potential. The opportunity is a pure intellectual property licensing play with low capital requirements. Structure and other details are still under discussion, but we have agreed in principle that the company's upfront cash commitment would be 0. The company's primary out-of-pocket expenses would be approximately $7 million to $8 million in working capital over the next 18 to 24 months. These amounts would be extended as the technology is positioned for full commercialization. There would be a stock-based earn-out and increments of 10% of company stock earned when our share price exceeds $100 and as the share climbs above each $100 threshold thereafter adjusted for appreciation attributed to lending. Any transactions would, of course, be subject to definitive contract documents and the presentation that Bill is going to give is also going to be placed upon onto our website. At this time, I invite Bill to present this technology. Bill?\nWilliam Erbey: Thank you, Charlie. Good afternoon. First, let me caveat this presentation by saying there are no guarantees that the [Alpha] Control System will be technologically or commercially successful and that all elements of the presentation represent our understanding at the present time. The principal challenge of electromotive vehicles is their lack of range, which is caused by electric motors having an eye of high efficiency or over a narrow range of torque and speed. Outside the eye of high efficiency, efficiency and range rapidly declined. Beginning in 2017, my concept is to utilize multiple motors with unique peak efficiencies at various torque and speed combinations throughout the drive cycle and engage those motors through our standard optimization algorithm, such as the most efficient motor or motors are always being utilized. We're using mathematics to solve a physical problem. Our test results indicate a 50% reduction in energy loss and heat generation and -- resulting in an 8% increase in range. The market for electromotive vehicles, cars, trucks, construction and mining equipment is large and rapidly growing. To penetrate the market, we are engaged with a world-class engineering team with outstanding industry contacts with the next steps being prototype development and commercialization. The two greatest challenges of electric vehicles are range and heat dissipation as corroborated by both Elon Musk and Peter Rawlinson, the CEO of Lucid Motors. The graph is one representation of the efficiency curve of an electric motor. There is a very narrow range of torque and speed where given electric motor is highly efficient. Outside that range, efficiency and hence range declined rapidly. The opportunity lies in selecting multiple electric motors having peak efficiencies at various combinations of torque and speed, combining multiple motors with a control system which optimizes motor selection, significantly enhances efficiency and range. The key point is the greater the variability in torque and speed, the greater the opportunity to increase efficiency with our patent. Alpha Controls owns 2 U.S. patents and 1 U.K. patent with additional patents pending. Our patents cover not only optimized motor selection under driving conditions for a given set of motors but also can be utilized to select the optimal combination of motors to be installed in a particular electromotive vehicle. We've completed the technical and commercial assessment with our partner, which covered patent evaluation, simulation, modeling and testing and commercial feasibility and value assessment. Simulation occurred at the University of Bath in England at the world renounced IAAPS Advanced Propulsion Center. The simulation concluded that for a Tesla Model 3, the patent technology will increase range by 8.4%. This can also have the significant impact on the environment, not only will the vehicle generate far less heat but to the extent fossil fuels are used to generate the electricity, less pollution, and again, less heat generated. Please keep in mind that these results are simulations granted with actual motors. However, ultimately results in terms of performance enhancement and value created may vary widely in commercial application. The commercial assessment by our partner concluded that for the Tesla Model 3, which represents 19% of Tesla sales that the value created under 3 business cases was between $105 million and $393 million per year. There is upside potential and range improvement. Current motor design is focused on single motor automotive use. The existing motors are very inefficient in low torque and speed conditions. Our partner is evaluating motors developed for other applications, which can be utilized as well as speaking with motor manufacturers to develop a motor specifically for this application. Our partner's preliminary evaluation of the IP is the total available market of $49.5 billion and a serviceable available market of $9.2 billion annually. Of course, these are any projections and should not be relied upon. Keep in mind, however, Alpha is a licensed model in a highly tax advantaged location. At scale, most revenue should translate into after-tax earnings. Early on, I recognized that I had neither the expertise nor the industry contacts to develop and commercialize the patent. Therefore, I sought out and was able to reach an agreement with one of the leading firms in the electromotive vehicles. It is the Alejandro Agag group of companies at the Formula E, the electric equivalent of Formula 1; the Extreme E, which is electric off-road racing; and E1, which is electric boat racing, along with SeaBird Technologies, which is responsible for motor development. Many of the same constructors have participated in Formula 1 participated in Formula E, Jaguar, McLaren, Maserati, Nissan and Porsche. Supporting SeaBird is purple sector led by Mark Mathieson and his team. Mark is a former Chief Engineer of Powertrain Research at McLaren Engineering. The next phase of the project is prototype development and commercialization, both Richard and Mark believe that developing a protocol will significantly increase our commercial returns. The prototype in commercialization are projected across between $7 million and $8 million and will require up to 18 months. The partner development contract demonstrates conviction in technology and commercial application by a world-class partner. SeaBird receives a 10% ownership in Alpha when revenues attributable to partner's efforts exceeds $500 million per year. Again, this is a licensing model. SeaBird is our exclusive worldwide distributor for 2 years, and we'll receive 10% of revenue up to $250 million and 20% of revenue over $250 million per annum. Thank you for your time.\nCharles Frischer: Thanks. That was really helpful, Bill. I hope people appreciated the presentation. At this time, we'd be happy to take questions on the Alpha technology presentation and also at the end of this, I'll have a few special comments for the folks on the call. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Jeff Moore with [Borough] Capital.\nUnidentified Analyst: I'm curious, where is Jason? Is he on the call or...\nCharles Frischer: No, Jason is not on the call. Jason is working on our strategic review. And -- but we've had the decision to make that not have him on the call.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got you. Okay. Can you comment any on the -- I guess, the general status of the Lending Operations?\nCharles Frischer: Yes. We're not looking to take questions on the specifics of Lending Operations until our overall review is completed. I will tell you, Jeff, that it's just -- we are in this position because the Lending Operations, as you can see by our quarterly results, wasn't meeting our expectations, and we're being proactive in trying to make adjustments to make it profitable or to make the decision what to do with the operation in its entirety.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Well, thanks for being proactive about that. I think earlier you mentioned something about asset-light managers -- management services and stuff that you were looking at. And I may be misremembering that, but something to that effect, could you talk about that anything?\nCharles Frischer: Yes. I think, Jeff, the way we think about it is with the business that Bill presented, it's the ultimate asset-light business. The revenues will largely be licensing. We'll have no production. We will have no manufacturing really to speak of. And the vast majority of the revenue would drop down to the bottom line. So I think that really is a great example of what we're trying to do. So if you have one more question, Jeff?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Just one more and then I'll shut up. What's your commitment to the New York Stock Exchange listing? I know that the total market cap of the company, if I remember right, needs to be more than $50 million? It looks like after hours, you guys are about half that. What's your commitment to maintaining that listing and whatnot?\nCharles Frischer: Yes, I think we'll be proactive in maintaining -- taking best efforts to have a listing that's acceptable to shareholders.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have no further phone questions.\nCharles Frischer: Okay, operator. That's very helpful. I'd like to make a few final comments. First of all, thank you for joining us today. I would like to say that I've gotten to know Bill Erbey pretty well over the last few weeks and months, and I found him to be very smart, hard-working and with excellent judgment. I think having Bill involved with the company in the future will be a strong addition, and he will hopefully help create value for shareholders. As the largest shareholder with 45% ownership of the company, he has tremendous incentive to see the stock price move higher over time. I also look forward to providing more details regarding the review of the mortgage business over the next few months as we continue with the evaluation and improvements. I've also put my [indiscernible] information on the company's press release if folks have additional questions or comments. The Board is excited about the possibilities of the control system technology. No venture is without risk, but licensing IP assets designed to extend the range of electric vehicles to provide significant return to shareholders, if successful. We've also worked hard to create a potential acquisition with no cash consideration today and one that only earns a return for the seller if AAMC stock enjoys quite oversized returns. Thank you very much for your time today.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead.\nDanya Sawyer: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AAMC’s Q1 2023 Annual Earnings Conference Call. I’m Danya Sawyer, the new Chief Operating Officer of Lending Operations at AAMC. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements made during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical in nature, as described under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As previously mentioned, today’s call is being recorded and a link to this webcast will be posted to our website later today. With that, joining me for today’s call is our Chief Executive Officer, Jason Kopcak. Jason will provide an update on our first quarter 2023 activity, review additional corporate developments and present an overview of our outlook for the year ahead. We will then open the line for questions. Lastly, materials for this call can be found in our Investor Presentation, which was issued earlier this morning. Related information can also be found on the stockholders page of our website at www.altisourceamc.om. And now, I’ll turn it over to Jason.\nJason Kopcak: Thank you, Danya. It has been about seven short weeks since we last spoke. However, a lot was accomplished in that time. As a reminder, we are a capital-light originator of private credit products. In our business model, for every dollar of capital that we deploy, we can originate $10 of assets to sell. Once we’ve achieved normalized operations, we turn our loans on average weekly with a net margin of 150 basis points. This means that we expect to earn $7.50 for every dollar capital deployed at the beginning of the year. On Slide 8, assuming $20 million in weekly production, the original $2 million of capital required would grow to $17.5 million at the end of the year. Therefore, as we grow faster, we would expect to generate more excess cash. Given the progress that we have made in building our loan production facility and pipeline, we have led the closed loan portfolio runoff to position our capital to be available for wholesale and the direct-to-borrower origination, which reduced interest income for the quarter. [Indiscernible] first quarter earnings improved by $1.1 million, reducing the first quarter loss to $3 million on revenue of $2.1 million. Our product mix includes both short duration one to two-year term, high-yielding fixed income assets with a gross weighted average coupon of 9.5% to 12%, secured by one to four family residential or multifamily residential properties going through value improvements, also known as residential transitional loans or RTLs, as well as long duration, interest-only secured by income-producing residential properties also known as DSCR loans. Unlike our peers, we do not use loan securitizations or banks as an exit for our loans. Instead, we establish individual criteria or a buy box to sell loans to institutions with permanent capital such as insurance companies, endowments and pension funds. Our investments do not have the infrastructure to originate yet potentially have over $1 trillion allocated to alternative fixed income assets. I have 15 years of experience and unique relationships with these institutions. As a reminder, once we have secured our take-on investor, we then go to originate these assets – these loans via our three channels: direct-to-borrower, wholesale and broker channel. Turning to our accomplishments. In Q1, we hired Danya Sawyer as COO of both Algent Lending, direct-to-borrower platform and Alternative Lending Group, our Wholesale Lending platform. She has made an immediate impact with the build out of our loan production operations across all origination channels and manages relationships with institutional buyers. We added three additional takeout investors, two of which have insurance money. We are in talks with several additional takeout investors. In 2022, we are primarily a buyer of closed residential transitional loans. But as of mid-January of 2023, as planned, we turned on our direct-to-borrower origination channel. And in late March, we did a soft rollout of our wholesale platform. As a reminder, there is materially more revenue and profits to be earned from originating a loan versus purchasing a closed loan. Furthermore, if the customer experience is good, these borrowers often finance multiple projects each year. In the fixed income market, there’s significantly more demand for soft originated paper. Turning to our Q2 2023 goals and operating metric standard. To go live with our wholesale platform. Another goal of ours is to go live with our direct-to-broker channel. For the RTLs, we – our expected gross revenue per loan is in excess of 350 basis points. For term and DSCR loans, our expected gross revenue per loan is in excess of 250 basis points. Once stabilized, our cost of process alone is expected to be $160 per file. This represents a significant competitive advantage due to our – due to having our loan production principally conducted in Bangalore, India. Our expected average loan size for RTLs is approximately 500,000. Our expected average loan size for DSCR loans is approximately 300,000. As we are still in the process of setting up our loan production lines, there is no guarantee that all loans in our current pipeline will close. However, as of May 10, our pipeline consists of the following. Direct-to-borrower origination pipeline is approximately $75 million. The wholesale channel has a committed volume of $45 million. On Slide B, the $62 million of our pipeline from a direct-to-borrower channel represents net submissions of $38 million over the last past seven weeks, with a net of $11 million of closings. The $45 million of our pipeline from the wholesale channel represents a net submission of $37 million over the past seven weeks, net of $7 million of loan closings. We plan on rolling out our direct – I’m sorry, our broker direct channel this week. For the past seven weeks, our net submissions averaged $10.7 million per week and have grown substantially over the period. We expect continued growth in all three channels. By the way of example on Slide C, in the wholesale channel, we presently have five clients. Client one had net submissions of $29.5 million and has been active since March 1. We have 100% participation of their sales force, which has four loan officers. Client two has net submissions of $15 million has been active since March 9. We have approximately 2% for distribution of their sales force, which is approximately 250 loan officers. Client three has net submissions of $0.5 million, has been active since April 27 and we have approximately 5% of their sales force, which is 11 loan officers. Client four, we go live with them this week, has approximately 600 loan officers. Client five, we will go live the week of June 1, has approximately 2,000 loan officers. In summary, we are experiencing strong demand for our products from both the perspective of the borrowers and our takeout investors. Hence, we are perfecting – we’re focused on perfecting and scaling our operations. I’m excited by the team’s accomplishments since I joined as CEO last July. I’m looking forward to ramping our performance through the year. With that, I’ll turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from [Jeff Moore], private investor. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. On slide B, you say over the past seven weeks, net submissions have grown an average of $10.7 million per week and accelerated over the period. Kind of towards the more recent weeks in that period, about what of those average per week?\nJason Kopcak: I don’t have it broken out in front of me. We can circle back with that information. But, yes, we don’t have the information in front of me. So I’d like to circle back with you on that one, Jeff.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. But I mean, at the end of the day, like, over the past, say, two months, you’ve had submissions of 10.7 a week. So call it, like, $45 million, $50 million a month, which will put you on a run rate for kind of the targets you put out at the start of the year. And you haven’t even really rolled out a lot of the broker wholesales yet.\nJason Kopcak: Exactly. So I think to your point, Jeff, what’s interesting is if you look in our direct-to-borrower platform, what we’ve seen is over the last seven weeks, our pipeline is more than double on the direct-to-borrower. And that’s the – that’s a channel we rolled out in mid January. We did a soft rollout on wholesale. And the goal with that is that you roll out a channel, you’re going to come across issues. And right away, I think the first two weeks, we had $15 million in submissions. Now we’re up at $45 million, and we really are scratching the surface. So the volume is picking up dramatically in the last three weeks. We feel good about it, but we are focused on operations. We’re focused on the process with our partners. So that way, we get them a smooth experience because anybody can go live, but it’s all about having a good customer experience and good execution. That’s what we’re focused on perfecting that part of it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. So on the execution front, like, on average, how long does it take to close one of these loans? And what are some of the challenges and the successes that you guys have had in kind of rolling this out operationally?\nJason Kopcak: So typically, a loan on average, I guess, the average loan takes about 40, about 30 days, okay? These are nuance loans. What we find is with our new construction, the borrowers are typically a little more experienced and they close a little quicker and the fix and flip a little bit less experience take a little longer. So what we found exactly that is, the more experienced borrowers get – have packages that come in quicker and tighter. What have we learned? We learned that there’s a lot of demand even as rates are dramatically up over the year before. We’re not concerned about the amount of demand coming in the door. What we’re trying to do is make sure that we have a tight process that we can close unefficiently and deliver a saleable loan. So what do we – what experience have we had in last 30 days? I think our packages are a lot tighter today than they were 30 days ago. The scalability of our loans are tighter. I’ve been on the trading desk for years. And trust me, you’ll see operations that have really sloppy close packages. We don’t want that. We want the loan – the borrower coming in. We want it closing in 30 days and we want to be able to sell it within three to five days. So the amount of time today at closing a loan is probably half of what it was two months ago and our saleability has gone up dramatically. I mean, the quality of the packages we put together are much improved over the last 60 days.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. So you’re going to be turning your capital every three days, every three to five days is what it sounds like, right?\nJason Kopcak: That’s the goal. The goal in an ideal role when we get to normalized operations, we’re turning the capital every three to five days, okay? If we run the system right, again, Danya, we brought Danya in for a reason. She’s very experienced. She’s very disciplined. And the goal is to turn – we close a loan and we sell it and we get reimbursed within three to five days. So that’s our target. We feel comfortable it can be done. But with that being said, that’s part of the process we’re building out right now.\nUnidentified Analyst: It was impressive. So good luck on that. Also, I was happy to see you’ll repurchase just like just under 20,000 shares of stock. What – are those repurchases, do you think you’re going to continue them? I mean, how do you feel about those right now?\nJason Kopcak: So look, the thought was we’re there. We can do it. We still feel the stocks is undervalued. So part of what we do is we have the ability to please the stock. Number two is, if we feel that – we don’t have a strict amount that we had to put out and that we plan on buying. But we are opportunistic looking at the stock. So we still feel it’s undervalued, but frankly, right now we’re conserving our capital for our originations because turning our capital 50 times a year is more valuable than buying stock, so.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. Well, thanks for answering my questions. I’ll hop back in if I have anything else.\nJason Kopcak: Thanks. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nJason Kopcak: So there’s a question that came in. It says, can you talk about the impact of the regional bank issues? And it’s a great question. So I want to come right out and say, look, our bank partners have been fantastic. They’ve been great partners. They’re very experienced banks in the real estate and mortgage space. They’ve come to us actually about increasing our line in doing more business. So from that standpoint, it’s very comforting. The bank issues – look, I think at the end of the day, the regional bank sector is overall holding up pretty well. How has it affected us? I think we’re – like we know what bank partners are good partners. So it’s actually strengthened. We had great relationships with our banks. We have the ability to increase our lines. So that’s shown that we picked the right partners. So I think for us has been great. It has caused – some of our peers has caused them problems because some of the weaker banks have fallen out and they pulled back from real estate. So frankly, the regional bank issues has actually been a win for us because we, again, we’ve lined ourselves with the right banks who understand and comfortable with the real estate space and mortgage space and their balance sheet is strong. And then some of our peers have been aligned with the – probably some of the softer regional banks and has caused them some headaches. So I feel, for us, it’s been a win-win for us. Any other questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] It appears there are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the conference back over for any additional or closing remarks.\nJason Kopcak: Well, I appreciate your time. We look forward to the year ahead, and have a great week. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today’s call. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

I have 15 years of experience and unique relationships with these institutions. As a reminder, once we have secured our take-on investor, we then go to originate these assets – these loans via our three channels: direct-to-borrower, wholesale and broker channel. Turning to our accomplishments. In Q1, we hired Danya Sawyer as COO of both Algent Lending, direct-to-borrower platform and Alternative Lending Group, our Wholesale Lending platform. She has made an immediate impact with the build out of our loan production operations across all origination channels and manages relationships with institutional buyers. We added three additional takeout investors, two of which have insurance money. We are in talks with several additional takeout investors. In 2022, we are primarily a buyer of closed residential transitional loans. But as of mid-January of 2023, as planned, we turned on our direct-to-borrower origination channel. And in late March, we did a soft rollout of our wholesale platform. As a reminder, there is materially more revenue and profits to be earned from originating a loan versus purchasing a closed loan. Furthermore, if the customer experience is good, these borrowers often finance multiple projects each year. In the fixed income market, there’s significantly more demand for soft originated paper. Turning to our Q2 2023 goals and operating metric standard. To go live with our wholesale platform. Another goal of ours is to go live with our direct-to-broker channel. For the RTLs, we – our expected gross revenue per loan is in excess of 350 basis points. For term and DSCR loans, our expected gross revenue per loan is in excess of 250 basis points. Once stabilized, our cost of process alone is expected to be $160 per file. This represents a significant competitive advantage due to our – due to having our loan production principally conducted in Bangalore, India. Our expected average loan size for RTLs is approximately 500,000. Our expected average loan size for DSCR loans is approximately 300,000. As we are still in the process of setting up our loan production lines, there is no guarantee that all loans in our current pipeline will close. However, as of May 10, our pipeline consists of the following. Direct-to-borrower origination pipeline is approximately $75 million. The wholesale channel has a committed volume of $45 million. On Slide B, the $62 million of our pipeline from a direct-to-borrower channel represents net submissions of $38 million over the last past seven weeks, with a net of $11 million of closings. The $45 million of our pipeline from the wholesale channel represents a net submission of $37 million over the past seven weeks, net of $7 million of loan closings. We plan on rolling out our direct – I’m sorry, our broker direct channel this week. For the past seven weeks, our net submissions averaged $10.7 million per week and have grown substantially over the period. We expect continued growth in all three channels. By the way of example on Slide C, in the wholesale channel, we presently have five clients. Client one had net submissions of $29.5 million and has been active since March 1. We have 100% participation of their sales force, which has four loan officers. Client two has net submissions of $15 million has been active since March 9. We have approximately 2% for distribution of their sales force, which is approximately 250 loan officers. Client three has net submissions of $0.5 million, has been active since April 27 and we have approximately 5% of their sales force, which is 11 loan officers. Client four, we go live with them this week, has approximately 600 loan officers. Client five, we will go live the week of June 1, has approximately 2,000 loan officers. In summary, we are experiencing strong demand for our products from both the perspective of the borrowers and our takeout investors. Hence, we are perfecting – we’re focused on perfecting and scaling our operations. I’m excited by the team’s accomplishments since I joined as CEO last July. I’m looking forward to ramping our performance through the year. With that, I’ll turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from [Jeff Moore], private investor. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. On slide B, you say over the past seven weeks, net submissions have grown an average of $10.7 million per week and accelerated over the period. Kind of towards the more recent weeks in that period, about what of those average per week?\nJason Kopcak: I don’t have it broken out in front of me. We can circle back with that information. But, yes, we don’t have the information in front of me. So I’d like to circle back with you on that one, Jeff.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. But I mean, at the end of the day, like, over the past, say, two months, you’ve had submissions of 10.7 a week. So call it, like, $45 million, $50 million a month, which will put you on a run rate for kind of the targets you put out at the start of the year. And you haven’t even really rolled out a lot of the broker wholesales yet.\nJason Kopcak: Exactly. So I think to your point, Jeff, what’s interesting is if you look in our direct-to-borrower platform, what we’ve seen is over the last seven weeks, our pipeline is more than double on the direct-to-borrower. And that’s the – that’s a channel we rolled out in mid January. We did a soft rollout on wholesale. And the goal with that is that you roll out a channel, you’re going to come across issues. And right away, I think the first two weeks, we had $15 million in submissions. Now we’re up at $45 million, and we really are scratching the surface. So the volume is picking up dramatically in the last three weeks. We feel good about it, but we are focused on operations. We’re focused on the process with our partners. So that way, we get them a smooth experience because anybody can go live, but it’s all about having a good customer experience and good execution. That’s what we’re focused on perfecting that part of it.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. So on the execution front, like, on average, how long does it take to close one of these loans? And what are some of the challenges and the successes that you guys have had in kind of rolling this out operationally?\nJason Kopcak: So typically, a loan on average, I guess, the average loan takes about 40, about 30 days, okay? These are nuance loans. What we find is with our new construction, the borrowers are typically a little more experienced and they close a little quicker and the fix and flip a little bit less experience take a little longer. So what we found exactly that is, the more experienced borrowers get – have packages that come in quicker and tighter. What have we learned? We learned that there’s a lot of demand even as rates are dramatically up over the year before. We’re not concerned about the amount of demand coming in the door. What we’re trying to do is make sure that we have a tight process that we can close unefficiently and deliver a saleable loan. So what do we – what experience have we had in last 30 days? I think our packages are a lot tighter today than they were 30 days ago. The scalability of our loans are tighter. I’ve been on the trading desk for years. And trust me, you’ll see operations that have really sloppy close packages. We don’t want that. We want the loan – the borrower coming in. We want it closing in 30 days and we want to be able to sell it within three to five days. So the amount of time today at closing a loan is probably half of what it was two months ago and our saleability has gone up dramatically. I mean, the quality of the packages we put together are much improved over the last 60 days.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. So you’re going to be turning your capital every three days, every three to five days is what it sounds like, right?\nJason Kopcak: That’s the goal. The goal in an ideal role when we get to normalized operations, we’re turning the capital every three to five days, okay? If we run the system right, again, Danya, we brought Danya in for a reason. She’s very experienced. She’s very disciplined. And the goal is to turn – we close a loan and we sell it and we get reimbursed within three to five days. So that’s our target. We feel comfortable it can be done. But with that being said, that’s part of the process we’re building out right now.\nUnidentified Analyst: It was impressive. So good luck on that. Also, I was happy to see you’ll repurchase just like just under 20,000 shares of stock. What – are those repurchases, do you think you’re going to continue them? I mean, how do you feel about those right now?\nJason Kopcak: So look, the thought was we’re there. We can do it. We still feel the stocks is undervalued. So part of what we do is we have the ability to please the stock. Number two is, if we feel that – we don’t have a strict amount that we had to put out and that we plan on buying. But we are opportunistic looking at the stock. So we still feel it’s undervalued, but frankly, right now we’re conserving our capital for our originations because turning our capital 50 times a year is more valuable than buying stock, so.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. Well, thanks for answering my questions. I’ll hop back in if I have anything else.\nJason Kopcak: Thanks. Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nJason Kopcak: So there’s a question that came in. It says, can you talk about the impact of the regional bank issues? And it’s a great question. So I want to come right out and say, look, our bank partners have been fantastic. They’ve been great partners. They’re very experienced banks in the real estate and mortgage space. They’ve come to us actually about increasing our line in doing more business. So from that standpoint, it’s very comforting. The bank issues – look, I think at the end of the day, the regional bank sector is overall holding up pretty well. How has it affected us? I think we’re – like we know what bank partners are good partners. So it’s actually strengthened. We had great relationships with our banks. We have the ability to increase our lines. So that’s shown that we picked the right partners. So I think for us has been great. It has caused – some of our peers has caused them problems because some of the weaker banks have fallen out and they pulled back from real estate. So frankly, the regional bank issues has actually been a win for us because we, again, we’ve lined ourselves with the right banks who understand and comfortable with the real estate space and mortgage space and their balance sheet is strong. And then some of our peers have been aligned with the – probably some of the softer regional banks and has caused them some headaches. So I feel, for us, it’s been a win-win for us. Any other questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] It appears there are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the conference back over for any additional or closing remarks.\nJason Kopcak: Well, I appreciate your time. We look forward to the year ahead, and have a great week. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today’s call. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, May 1, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Melody Huang, SVP, Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Melody.\nMelody Huang : Good morning, and welcome to Acadian Asset Management, Inc.'s conference call to discuss our results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025.

Finally, nothing herein shall be deemed as an offer or solicitation to buy any investment products. Kelly Young, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead the call. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Kelly.\nKelly Young: Thanks, Melody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're very pleased with the path Acadian is on in 2025, and I'm excited to share our results for the first quarter with you. Acadian is the only pure-play publicly traded systematic manager. Founded in 1986, Acadian has pioneered systematic investing, and we continue to lead the sector through constant innovation. We've delivered sustained outperformance across various investment strategies and through numerous market cycles. We manage $121.9 billion of AUM, and Acadian is a pure systematic manager applying data and technology to the evaluation of global stocks and corporate bonds. 94% of our strategies by revenue are outperforming benchmarks over a 5-year period with 4.4% annualized excess return. Our competitive edge comes from the convergence of talented people, rich data, and powerful tools, and we have a 120-person investment team with over 100 advanced analytic degrees. We are implementing product and distribution initiatives to drive sustainable growth. Slide 4 showcases Acadian's Q1 2025 strong performance. Our net income attributable to controlling interest is up 38% compared to prior year, and U.S. GAAP EPS is up 46%. ENI diluted EPS of $0.54 per share is up 23% with adjusted EBITDA up 10%. We delivered $3.8 billion of positive net flows, our strongest quarter in 19 years and finished with AUM of $121.9 billion as of the 31st of March 2025. Acadian's investment performance track record remains strong despite the market volatility. We have 5 major implementations, which comprise the majority of our assets. As of March 31, 2025, global equity, emerging markets equity, non-U.S. equity, small-cap equity and our enhanced equity strategies have 100% of assets outperforming benchmarks across 3-, 5- and 10-year periods with one minor variation. In Q1 of 2025, global equity markets experienced significant volatility amid a complex macroeconomic backdrop. While U.S. equities fell, European markets and emerging markets both rose, partly driven by dollar weakening and investments outside of the U.S. provided significant diversification benefits for our clients' portfolios. Our disciplined systematic investment process has generated meaningful long-term alpha for our clients. Our revenue-weighted 5-year annualized return in excess of benchmark was 4.4% as of the end of Q1 of 2025 on a consolidated firm-wide basis. Our asset-weighted 5-year annualized return in excess of benchmark was 3.5% as of the end of Q1. By revenue weight, more than 94% of Acadian strategies outperformed their respective benchmarks across 3-, 5- and 10-year periods as of the end of March 2025. And by asset weight, more than 90% of Acadian strategies outperformed their respective benchmarks across 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. Next, I'd like to focus on Acadian's extensive global distribution platform, which has helped us achieve strong gross sales and will be a major driver of growth in the years ahead. For many years, Acadian has had a strong global presence with 4 offices in Boston, London, Sydney and Singapore. We have continued to expand our client and distribution team with over 90 experienced professionals serving more than 1,000 client accounts in 40 countries. The team has established strong deep relationships with many institutional clients and our average relationship length with our top 50 clients is over 10 years. We work with over 40 investment consultants across market segments and geographies, leading to a diverse client base invested across multiple strategies. We had approximately $9 billion of gross sales in the first quarter of 2025 after achieving record annual sales of $21 billion in 2024. In tandem with expanding our distribution capabilities, Acadian's business and product development teams have been focused on increasing our strategy and vehicle offerings in high demand and growing areas where Acadian's systematic approach is particularly well suited, and our current pipeline is very robust. The success of Acadian as a highly regarded institutional investment manager is testament to our proven investment process as well as Acadian's world-class investment and distribution teams. We have 6 clients among the top 20 global asset owners and 27 clients among the top 50 U.S. retirement plans. Over 50% of our assets are from clients invested in multiple Acadian strategies. Our client base is diverse with 37% of assets managed for clients outside of the U.S. We offer over 80 institutional quality funds for investors and achieved $8.8 billion of gross sales in Q1 of 2025, reaching $121.9 billion of assets under management as of the 31st of March 2025. The next slide highlights the positive trend in Acadian's net flows, showing a significant increase from the negative $2.3 billion in the full year of 2023 to the positive $1.8 billion in the full year for 2024 and reaching $3.8 billion in Q1 of this year. This was the highest quarterly NCCF that we've generated in 19 years. Our core strategies such as global, non-U.S. and EM equity saw robust net inflows and our newer strategies such as enhanced equity and extension equity strategies had meaningful positive flows in the first quarter of the year. As we discussed in our last earnings call, there are 4 key product initiatives in addition to our core strategy that we expect will drive Acadian's future growth. These are enhanced equity, extension equity, systematic credit and equity alternatives, and we continue to make strong progress in these endeavors. Our enhanced equity strategies underscore the potential for strong future growth as the market opportunity is vast. Enhanced equity is one of Acadian's key product initiatives to drive long-term growth. Recent flows have been robust with end of Q1 2025 AUM of $12 billion, doubling from the prior year and expected to continue meaningful growth in the future. Enhanced equity strategies address investors increasing demand for consistent, low-risk alpha at fees below those of fully active strategies. These strategies appeal to a number of investors, including investors in the $16 trillion global passive equity market who are seeking improved performance with modest incremental risk. Our enhanced equity strategies repackage Acadian's alpha in a lower-risk manner to meet market demand. These strategies leverage Acadian's proprietary investment process to invest in benchmark stocks and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns with lower tracking error. And current notable implementations include the Russell 1000, MSCI ACWI and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes. Results have been robust, as shown on Slide 13. Our enhanced equity targets stable alpha with low active risk and has produced consistent outperformance versus benchmarks. In the chart below, we highlight the relationship between the monthly 3-year annualized return of Acadian's enhanced Global Equity strategy versus that of the MSCI ACWI Index's monthly 3-year annualized return. We track the rolling return at each month end from Enhanced Global Equities inception date of September 2012 to the end of 2024. The solid line represents the index's returns. The dots representing the strategy returns are consistently close to or above the benchmark line, noting the outperformance since inception of the strategy at lower levels of tracking error than core strategies. Our enhanced equity strategies offer attractive risk-adjusted returns and can satisfy broader investment demand for lower fees and more consistent return characteristics. I'm now going to turn the call over to Melody to provide you with an update on capital allocation.\nMelody Huang : Thanks, Kelly. Acadian has low leverage ratios with high liquidity position. At the end of the first quarter 2025, we have $119.6 million in cash and $91.5 million in fee investments. Debt including outstanding balance on revolving credit facility of $80 million reflects draws to support first quarter seasonal needs and is expected to be fully paid down by year-end. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2x as of March 31, '25, and our net leverage ratio was just 1.3x as of end of Q1 '25. AAMI Board declared an interim dividend of $0.01 per share to be paid on June 27, 2025. Our balance sheet provides liquidity and financial flexibility to execute our growth strategy and to enhance shareholder value. We have demonstrated a track record of creating significant value through buybacks to our shareholders. Outstanding diluted shares went down 57% from $86 million in Q4 2019 to 37 million shares in Q1 2025. $1.4 billion in excess capital was returned to shareholders over the last 5 years through share buybacks and dividends. During the first quarter of 2025, we repurchased 0.8 million shares of common stock or 2% of total outstanding shares for an aggregate total of $19.4 million. We expect to continue generating strong free cash and deploying excess capital towards supporting organic growth and share buybacks. Now I'm going to turn the call back to Kelly.\nKelly Young: Thanks, Melody. Slide 16 highlights that Acadian is positioning for multiple expansions and value creation. The AAMI stock PE multiple based on last 12 months earning is around 9x. Our peer asset managers' average is higher at around 12x, indicating a 33% premium. Acadian Asset Management, Inc. stock price is at $26.69 as of the 29th of April 2025. If we apply that 33% increase to get our stock to the same 12x as our peers' average multiple, the implied price would be $35.50. This presents a compelling investment opportunity in AAMI given our strong growth potential. Before going into Q&A, I'd like to recap the key points in this presentation. We're the only pure-play publicly traded systematic manager. We have a nearly 40-year track record with competitive edge in systematic investing and Acadian's investment performance track record remains strong with more than 90% of strategies by revenue outperforming over 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. We started 2025 with outstanding performance. Q1 '25 ENI EPS is up 23% from Q1 of 2024. We delivered positive Q1 NCCF of $3.8 billion, our best quarterly flows in 19 years. We will continue to drive growth through targeted distribution initiatives and accelerate growth through key product initiatives such as enhanced equity. Acadian Asset Management, Inc. stock is trading at a modest PE multiple of 9x compared to our peer average of 12x. Acadian is well positioned to generate value for shareholders. Our team's focus, talent and hard work have been instrumental in achieving these milestones, and I look forward to building on this momentum and driving further growth and innovation. This concludes my prepared remarks. And at this point, I'd be delighted to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys : Congratulations on the strong flows here, best in 19 years. That's great to see. Nearly $9 billion gross sales, nearly $4 billion of net inflows. Maybe you could just unpack some of the key strategies that you saw contributing? And can you just remind us what the revenue impact was of those flows as we think about the organic base fee impact stemming from the strong flows in the quarter?\nKelly Young: Mike, nice to speak to you again. Yes, so flows in Q1 were really pretty diversified in terms of where we've seen those asset raising efforts. Particularly, we've seen, as I noted in my prepared remarks, a huge interest in our enhanced equity strategies and those different implementations, particularly, I'd say, across global and sort of broader equity and emerging markets implementation. So continuing to see real interest and momentum there as well as in our extension strategies, which, again, as you know, as we noted, they are 2 of our sort of key initiatives. So very excited to see the growth there. Other areas of conversation that we're having with investors and where we're seeing interest is sort of broadly, I would say, in non-U.S. strategies. And I think that's sort of some momentum and a bit of a pivot that we've seen through this quarter after last year, where there was tended to be quite a U.S.-centric bias. So certainly, I'd say kind of broad across the spectrum of our new initiatives as well as some of our core strategies. In terms of overall fee impact, so our blended rate remains around 38 basis points. Obviously, in the near term, we don't expect that to change. Obviously, over the longer term, things like enhanced tend to attract a lower fee as the sort of lower risk, lower return expectations on those strategies. But obviously, where we're seeing on the other side, interest in areas like extensions, like small cap, those attract higher fees, they're limited capacity in some cases. And so certainly, over the near term, we don't expect a change to that blended rate. But obviously, over the longer term, market dynamics, flows into different areas, may have an impact of medium to longer term.\nMichael Cyprys : Great. And then just a follow-up question on the pipeline. Maybe you could just help unpack how the composition of that looks today, size, magnitude, types of strategies in there, how that compares versus last quarter. And clearly, very strong, quite impressive investment performance. Just curious how that is evolving here in April given the volatile market backdrop.\nKelly Young: Yes, sure. So yes, in terms of pipeline, as I said, the momentum continues to build in those -- 2 of those key initiatives in the near term in both enhanced and extensions. So I expect those to continue to be a theme in terms of pipeline and asset raising through this year. And as I say, Michael, we're having kind of more conversations now than non-U.S. nature or sort of broader in terms of global and sort of some -- I'd say, some resurgence of interest in emerging markets. So pretty broad in terms of pipeline. Obviously, Q1, very strong quarter in terms of gross sales. The pipeline remains very robust. So again, we're obviously looking to continue to build on that momentum and feel pretty positive about where we are now going into Q2 and Q3. Perhaps, maybe I'll just comment a little bit on performance. Q1 saw some mixed performance across some of the strategies. I think the benefit of being long-term investors, we're steadfast and committed to our process. And as we noted in the presentation, our long-term returns obviously remain very strong. There's obviously been some very sharp swings in the market since early April. And I think this is where I think it's important to emphasize that Acadian's process adapts systematically and not emotionally to these types of environments. The process we've built is continually integrating new data and allowing us to respond, I'd say, objectively and systematically to evolving risks. So I always think it's a good reminder that we find opportunities in periods of dislocation and periods of stress often lead to mispricings. And so for a process like ours, again, this is when we can find particularly attractive opportunities, particularly in less efficient markets. But certainly, the macro backdrop has obviously been a little more challenging than perhaps 2024 was. But again, still with some good areas and bright spots of performance for us. And as things we hope start to settle down in Q2, again, I think we're well positioned for some good performance this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC.\nKenneth Lee : Just one on capital management. Wondering if you could share any updated thoughts around outlook for share repurchases for the rest of the year? And perhaps just remind us again what's remaining in terms of the share repurchase authorization at this point?\nKelly Young: Ken, nice to speak to you again. Yes, as we've previously disclosed over a number of quarters, one of our key objectives is obviously to return capital to shareholders through stock buybacks. So in Q1, as we noted, we bought back 0.8 million shares or $19 million in total. The most recent authorization has approximately $61 million remaining on it as of the end of the quarter. But maybe just to be clear on that, any actual buyback activity is obviously subject to a number of factors. That's obviously the company's stock price, the capital needs of the business, the economic backdrop, market conditions. So the Board does refresh the amount of that authorization from time to time when we think it's prudent to do so. But we don't have a specific time frame in mind to sort of finish those buybacks under that current authorization, Ken. And as I say, again, that's going to depend on a variety of factors such as stock price being one of them, but there is $61 million remaining on the current authorization.\nKenneth Lee: Okay. Great. Very helpful there. And just one follow-up, if I may. Looking through the slides, it looks as if the various expense ratios, the outlooks there are unchanged from last quarter, wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about potential levers Acadian might have for further expense reductions if needed, if market volatility were to continue, for example, for a longer period of time?\nMelody Huang : Ken, this is Melody. Yes, our expenses, operating expenses and variable comp ratio remain the same. I think we are going to be continued laser-focused on expense management. And in terms of the market volatility, we will manage our expenses, make sure that we continue to achieve the similar margin. So that's currently, the expenses ratio for the full year remains unchanged.\nKelly Young: And we generate very strong free cash flow, as you know, Ken. So I think we remain very well positioned today to support growth, to return capital to shareholders. But to Melody's point, we obviously remain laser-focused on expenses and being efficient. And again, I think one of the many benefits of being a systematic manager is the ability to raise assets and not necessarily have to scale costs in a linear fashion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Dunn from Evercore.\nJohn Dunn : I wonder just with the market moves we've had so far in 2Q, maybe could you give us a little color on what of your strategies is seeing demand in April and particularly managed well, which I think have been out of favor for a while and maybe this might be a more constructive environment for it.\nKelly Young: Sure. Yes, no, I mean, April has been a similar theme, I would say, to what we saw in sort of Q1 and the back half of Q1. The areas of interest have really tended to be our broader strategy, so sort of global and equity implementations, things that are not perhaps as focused on just the U.S. enhanced, again, I think the sort of lower risk, more consistent return profiles are proving to be pretty popular and resonating with clients. As you know, management has been a bit of a headwind for us in the most recent few quarters. But as you know, it's a strategy that I think that's recently had an opportunity to kind of reassert its value in this type of market environment. And we've certainly sort of seen that in, I'd say, the first 4 months of this year. I don't imagine that we're going to see a strong tailwind in terms of asset raising in that strategy in the next few quarters. But I do believe that investors that are -- that remain in those types of strategies will be pleased with their decision to keep those allocations given the current market environment. So again, not necessarily a strong tailwind and expecting to see huge growth in management, but I suspect it's going to be less of a headwind as those strategies kind of prove their worth in this type of environment.\nJohn Dunn : Got it. And then you just noted demand for non-U.S. strategies. Maybe you have any thoughts on the potential for even greater demand for non-U.S. strategies as people potentially look to put more money outside the U.S.\nKelly Young: Yes. I think it's going to be a theme in our -- it's a theme in our pipeline. I think it's going to be a theme in -- as we actually move to fund those mandates. Certainly, last year, there was a lot of focus and interest in sort of U.S. domestic strategies. We are seeing, I think, a number of investors think more carefully about their strategic asset allocation and perhaps adjusting those to either kind of broader developed markets mandates. Obviously, that includes U.S. in a global implementation, but also a lot of kind of [indiscernible] type mandates. So I agree with you. There has, I think, been a shift over the last 2 or 3 months in terms of investor focus and attention on those sort of broader implementations and things perhaps of more of an ex-U.S. nature.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Kelly.\nKelly Young: I'd just like to thank everyone for joining us today, and I wish you all a great day. Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, May 1, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Melody Huang, SVP, Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Melody.\nMelody Huang : Good morning, and welcome to Acadian Asset Management, Inc.'s conference call to discuss our results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025. Before we begin the presentation, please note that we may make forward-looking statements about our business and financial performance. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties appears in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing the earnings release and our 2024 Form 10-K. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them as a result of new information or future events. We may also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information about any non-GAAP measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can be found on our website, along with the slides that we will use as part of today's discussion. Finally, nothing herein shall be deemed as an offer or solicitation to buy any investment products. Kelly Young, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead the call. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Kelly.\nKelly Young: Thanks, Melody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're very pleased with the path Acadian is on in 2025, and I'm excited to share our results for the first quarter with you. Acadian is the only pure-play publicly traded systematic manager. Founded in 1986, Acadian has pioneered systematic investing, and we continue to lead the sector through constant innovation. We've delivered sustained outperformance across various investment strategies and through numerous market cycles. We manage $121.9 billion of AUM, and Acadian is a pure systematic manager applying data and technology to the evaluation of global stocks and corporate bonds. 94% of our strategies by revenue are outperforming benchmarks over a 5-year period with 4.4% annualized excess return. Our competitive edge comes from the convergence of talented people, rich data, and powerful tools, and we have a 120-person investment team with over 100 advanced analytic degrees. We are implementing product and distribution initiatives to drive sustainable growth. Slide 4 showcases Acadian's Q1 2025 strong performance. Our net income attributable to controlling interest is up 38% compared to prior year, and U.S. GAAP EPS is up 46%. ENI diluted EPS of $0.54 per share is up 23% with adjusted EBITDA up 10%. We delivered $3.8 billion of positive net flows, our strongest quarter in 19 years and finished with AUM of $121.9 billion as of the 31st of March 2025. Acadian's investment performance track record remains strong despite the market volatility. We have 5 major implementations, which comprise the majority of our assets. As of March 31, 2025, global equity, emerging markets equity, non-U.S. equity, small-cap equity and our enhanced equity strategies have 100% of assets outperforming benchmarks across 3-, 5- and 10-year periods with one minor variation. In Q1 of 2025, global equity markets experienced significant volatility amid a complex macroeconomic backdrop. While U.S. equities fell, European markets and emerging markets both rose, partly driven by dollar weakening and investments outside of the U.S. provided significant diversification benefits for our clients' portfolios. Our disciplined systematic investment process has generated meaningful long-term alpha for our clients. Our revenue-weighted 5-year annualized return in excess of benchmark was 4.4% as of the end of Q1 of 2025 on a consolidated firm-wide basis. Our asset-weighted 5-year annualized return in excess of benchmark was 3.5% as of the end of Q1. By revenue weight, more than 94% of Acadian strategies outperformed their respective benchmarks across 3-, 5- and 10-year periods as of the end of March 2025. And by asset weight, more than 90% of Acadian strategies outperformed their respective benchmarks across 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. Next, I'd like to focus on Acadian's extensive global distribution platform, which has helped us achieve strong gross sales and will be a major driver of growth in the years ahead. For many years, Acadian has had a strong global presence with 4 offices in Boston, London, Sydney and Singapore. We have continued to expand our client and distribution team with over 90 experienced professionals serving more than 1,000 client accounts in 40 countries. The team has established strong deep relationships with many institutional clients and our average relationship length with our top 50 clients is over 10 years. We work with over 40 investment consultants across market segments and geographies, leading to a diverse client base invested across multiple strategies. We had approximately $9 billion of gross sales in the first quarter of 2025 after achieving record annual sales of $21 billion in 2024. In tandem with expanding our distribution capabilities, Acadian's business and product development teams have been focused on increasing our strategy and vehicle offerings in high demand and growing areas where Acadian's systematic approach is particularly well suited, and our current pipeline is very robust. The success of Acadian as a highly regarded institutional investment manager is testament to our proven investment process as well as Acadian's world-class investment and distribution teams. We have 6 clients among the top 20 global asset owners and 27 clients among the top 50 U.S. retirement plans. Over 50% of our assets are from clients invested in multiple Acadian strategies. Our client base is diverse with 37% of assets managed for clients outside of the U.S. We offer over 80 institutional quality funds for investors and achieved $8.8 billion of gross sales in Q1 of 2025, reaching $121.9 billion of assets under management as of the 31st of March 2025. The next slide highlights the positive trend in Acadian's net flows, showing a significant increase from the negative $2.3 billion in the full year of 2023 to the positive $1.8 billion in the full year for 2024 and reaching $3.8 billion in Q1 of this year. This was the highest quarterly NCCF that we've generated in 19 years. Our core strategies such as global, non-U.S. and EM equity saw robust net inflows and our newer strategies such as enhanced equity and extension equity strategies had meaningful positive flows in the first quarter of the year. As we discussed in our last earnings call, there are 4 key product initiatives in addition to our core strategy that we expect will drive Acadian's future growth. These are enhanced equity, extension equity, systematic credit and equity alternatives, and we continue to make strong progress in these endeavors. Our enhanced equity strategies underscore the potential for strong future growth as the market opportunity is vast. Enhanced equity is one of Acadian's key product initiatives to drive long-term growth. Recent flows have been robust with end of Q1 2025 AUM of $12 billion, doubling from the prior year and expected to continue meaningful growth in the future. Enhanced equity strategies address investors increasing demand for consistent, low-risk alpha at fees below those of fully active strategies. These strategies appeal to a number of investors, including investors in the $16 trillion global passive equity market who are seeking improved performance with modest incremental risk. Our enhanced equity strategies repackage Acadian's alpha in a lower-risk manner to meet market demand. These strategies leverage Acadian's proprietary investment process to invest in benchmark stocks and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns with lower tracking error. And current notable implementations include the Russell 1000, MSCI ACWI and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes. Results have been robust, as shown on Slide 13. Our enhanced equity targets stable alpha with low active risk and has produced consistent outperformance versus benchmarks. In the chart below, we highlight the relationship between the monthly 3-year annualized return of Acadian's enhanced Global Equity strategy versus that of the MSCI ACWI Index's monthly 3-year annualized return. We track the rolling return at each month end from Enhanced Global Equities inception date of September 2012 to the end of 2024. The solid line represents the index's returns. The dots representing the strategy returns are consistently close to or above the benchmark line, noting the outperformance since inception of the strategy at lower levels of tracking error than core strategies. Our enhanced equity strategies offer attractive risk-adjusted returns and can satisfy broader investment demand for lower fees and more consistent return characteristics. I'm now going to turn the call over to Melody to provide you with an update on capital allocation.\nMelody Huang : Thanks, Kelly. Acadian has low leverage ratios with high liquidity position. At the end of the first quarter 2025, we have $119.6 million in cash and $91.5 million in fee investments. Debt including outstanding balance on revolving credit facility of $80 million reflects draws to support first quarter seasonal needs and is expected to be fully paid down by year-end. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2x as of March 31, '25, and our net leverage ratio was just 1.3x as of end of Q1 '25. AAMI Board declared an interim dividend of $0.01 per share to be paid on June 27, 2025. Our balance sheet provides liquidity and financial flexibility to execute our growth strategy and to enhance shareholder value. We have demonstrated a track record of creating significant value through buybacks to our shareholders. Outstanding diluted shares went down 57% from $86 million in Q4 2019 to 37 million shares in Q1 2025. $1.4 billion in excess capital was returned to shareholders over the last 5 years through share buybacks and dividends. During the first quarter of 2025, we repurchased 0.8 million shares of common stock or 2% of total outstanding shares for an aggregate total of $19.4 million. We expect to continue generating strong free cash and deploying excess capital towards supporting organic growth and share buybacks. Now I'm going to turn the call back to Kelly.\nKelly Young: Thanks, Melody. Slide 16 highlights that Acadian is positioning for multiple expansions and value creation. The AAMI stock PE multiple based on last 12 months earning is around 9x. Our peer asset managers' average is higher at around 12x, indicating a 33% premium. Acadian Asset Management, Inc. stock price is at $26.69 as of the 29th of April 2025. If we apply that 33% increase to get our stock to the same 12x as our peers' average multiple, the implied price would be $35.50. This presents a compelling investment opportunity in AAMI given our strong growth potential. Before going into Q&A, I'd like to recap the key points in this presentation. We're the only pure-play publicly traded systematic manager. We have a nearly 40-year track record with competitive edge in systematic investing and Acadian's investment performance track record remains strong with more than 90% of strategies by revenue outperforming over 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. We started 2025 with outstanding performance. Q1 '25 ENI EPS is up 23% from Q1 of 2024. We delivered positive Q1 NCCF of $3.8 billion, our best quarterly flows in 19 years. We will continue to drive growth through targeted distribution initiatives and accelerate growth through key product initiatives such as enhanced equity. Acadian Asset Management, Inc. stock is trading at a modest PE multiple of 9x compared to our peer average of 12x. Acadian is well positioned to generate value for shareholders. Our team's focus, talent and hard work have been instrumental in achieving these milestones, and I look forward to building on this momentum and driving further growth and innovation. This concludes my prepared remarks. And at this point, I'd be delighted to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys : Congratulations on the strong flows here, best in 19 years. That's great to see. Nearly $9 billion gross sales, nearly $4 billion of net inflows. Maybe you could just unpack some of the key strategies that you saw contributing? And can you just remind us what the revenue impact was of those flows as we think about the organic base fee impact stemming from the strong flows in the quarter?\nKelly Young: Mike, nice to speak to you again. Yes, so flows in Q1 were really pretty diversified in terms of where we've seen those asset raising efforts. Particularly, we've seen, as I noted in my prepared remarks, a huge interest in our enhanced equity strategies and those different implementations, particularly, I'd say, across global and sort of broader equity and emerging markets implementation. So continuing to see real interest and momentum there as well as in our extension strategies, which, again, as you know, as we noted, they are 2 of our sort of key initiatives. So very excited to see the growth there. Other areas of conversation that we're having with investors and where we're seeing interest is sort of broadly, I would say, in non-U.S. strategies. And I think that's sort of some momentum and a bit of a pivot that we've seen through this quarter after last year, where there was tended to be quite a U.S.-centric bias. So certainly, I'd say kind of broad across the spectrum of our new initiatives as well as some of our core strategies. In terms of overall fee impact, so our blended rate remains around 38 basis points. Obviously, in the near term, we don't expect that to change. Obviously, over the longer term, things like enhanced tend to attract a lower fee as the sort of lower risk, lower return expectations on those strategies. But obviously, where we're seeing on the other side, interest in areas like extensions, like small cap, those attract higher fees, they're limited capacity in some cases. And so certainly, over the near term, we don't expect a change to that blended rate. But obviously, over the longer term, market dynamics, flows into different areas, may have an impact of medium to longer term.\nMichael Cyprys : Great. And then just a follow-up question on the pipeline. Maybe you could just help unpack how the composition of that looks today, size, magnitude, types of strategies in there, how that compares versus last quarter. And clearly, very strong, quite impressive investment performance. Just curious how that is evolving here in April given the volatile market backdrop.\nKelly Young: Yes, sure. So yes, in terms of pipeline, as I said, the momentum continues to build in those -- 2 of those key initiatives in the near term in both enhanced and extensions. So I expect those to continue to be a theme in terms of pipeline and asset raising through this year. And as I say, Michael, we're having kind of more conversations now than non-U.S. nature or sort of broader in terms of global and sort of some -- I'd say, some resurgence of interest in emerging markets. So pretty broad in terms of pipeline. Obviously, Q1, very strong quarter in terms of gross sales. The pipeline remains very robust. So again, we're obviously looking to continue to build on that momentum and feel pretty positive about where we are now going into Q2 and Q3. Perhaps, maybe I'll just comment a little bit on performance. Q1 saw some mixed performance across some of the strategies. I think the benefit of being long-term investors, we're steadfast and committed to our process. And as we noted in the presentation, our long-term returns obviously remain very strong. There's obviously been some very sharp swings in the market since early April. And I think this is where I think it's important to emphasize that Acadian's process adapts systematically and not emotionally to these types of environments. The process we've built is continually integrating new data and allowing us to respond, I'd say, objectively and systematically to evolving risks. So I always think it's a good reminder that we find opportunities in periods of dislocation and periods of stress often lead to mispricings. And so for a process like ours, again, this is when we can find particularly attractive opportunities, particularly in less efficient markets. But certainly, the macro backdrop has obviously been a little more challenging than perhaps 2024 was. But again, still with some good areas and bright spots of performance for us. And as things we hope start to settle down in Q2, again, I think we're well positioned for some good performance this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC.\nKenneth Lee : Just one on capital management. Wondering if you could share any updated thoughts around outlook for share repurchases for the rest of the year? And perhaps just remind us again what's remaining in terms of the share repurchase authorization at this point?\nKelly Young: Ken, nice to speak to you again. Yes, as we've previously disclosed over a number of quarters, one of our key objectives is obviously to return capital to shareholders through stock buybacks. So in Q1, as we noted, we bought back 0.8 million shares or $19 million in total. The most recent authorization has approximately $61 million remaining on it as of the end of the quarter. But maybe just to be clear on that, any actual buyback activity is obviously subject to a number of factors. That's obviously the company's stock price, the capital needs of the business, the economic backdrop, market conditions. So the Board does refresh the amount of that authorization from time to time when we think it's prudent to do so. But we don't have a specific time frame in mind to sort of finish those buybacks under that current authorization, Ken. And as I say, again, that's going to depend on a variety of factors such as stock price being one of them, but there is $61 million remaining on the current authorization.\nKenneth Lee: Okay. Great. Very helpful there. And just one follow-up, if I may. Looking through the slides, it looks as if the various expense ratios, the outlooks there are unchanged from last quarter, wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about potential levers Acadian might have for further expense reductions if needed, if market volatility were to continue, for example, for a longer period of time?\nMelody Huang : Ken, this is Melody. Yes, our expenses, operating expenses and variable comp ratio remain the same. I think we are going to be continued laser-focused on expense management. And in terms of the market volatility, we will manage our expenses, make sure that we continue to achieve the similar margin. So that's currently, the expenses ratio for the full year remains unchanged.\nKelly Young: And we generate very strong free cash flow, as you know, Ken. So I think we remain very well positioned today to support growth, to return capital to shareholders. But to Melody's point, we obviously remain laser-focused on expenses and being efficient. And again, I think one of the many benefits of being a systematic manager is the ability to raise assets and not necessarily have to scale costs in a linear fashion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Dunn from Evercore.\nJohn Dunn : I wonder just with the market moves we've had so far in 2Q, maybe could you give us a little color on what of your strategies is seeing demand in April and particularly managed well, which I think have been out of favor for a while and maybe this might be a more constructive environment for it.\nKelly Young: Sure. Yes, no, I mean, April has been a similar theme, I would say, to what we saw in sort of Q1 and the back half of Q1. The areas of interest have really tended to be our broader strategy, so sort of global and equity implementations, things that are not perhaps as focused on just the U.S. enhanced, again, I think the sort of lower risk, more consistent return profiles are proving to be pretty popular and resonating with clients. As you know, management has been a bit of a headwind for us in the most recent few quarters. But as you know, it's a strategy that I think that's recently had an opportunity to kind of reassert its value in this type of market environment. And we've certainly sort of seen that in, I'd say, the first 4 months of this year. I don't imagine that we're going to see a strong tailwind in terms of asset raising in that strategy in the next few quarters. But I do believe that investors that are -- that remain in those types of strategies will be pleased with their decision to keep those allocations given the current market environment. So again, not necessarily a strong tailwind and expecting to see huge growth in management, but I suspect it's going to be less of a headwind as those strategies kind of prove their worth in this type of environment.\nJohn Dunn : Got it. And then you just noted demand for non-U.S. strategies. Maybe you have any thoughts on the potential for even greater demand for non-U.S. strategies as people potentially look to put more money outside the U.S.\nKelly Young: Yes. I think it's going to be a theme in our -- it's a theme in our pipeline. I think it's going to be a theme in -- as we actually move to fund those mandates. Certainly, last year, there was a lot of focus and interest in sort of U.S. domestic strategies. We are seeing, I think, a number of investors think more carefully about their strategic asset allocation and perhaps adjusting those to either kind of broader developed markets mandates. Obviously, that includes U.S. in a global implementation, but also a lot of kind of [indiscernible] type mandates. So I agree with you. There has, I think, been a shift over the last 2 or 3 months in terms of investor focus and attention on those sort of broader implementations and things perhaps of more of an ex-U.S. nature.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Kelly.\nKelly Young: I'd just like to thank everyone for joining us today, and I wish you all a great day. Thank you.",

During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, February 6, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. I would now like to turn the call over to Melody Huang, Senior Vice President and Director of Finance and Investor Relations.

And now I’m pleased to turn the call over to Kelly.\nKelly Young: Thanks, Melody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I take on the role of CEO of Acadian Asset Management Inc., I’m mindful of the incredible journey that has brought us here. Acadian has been around for nearly 40 years. And for most of that time, we’ve been under the umbrella and brand name of another holding company, but today marks the first time that Acadian releases earnings as a stand-alone company. Our firm has been built on an impressive performance track record through various market cycles. We have a stellar reputation among institutional investors, and we’re the only stand-alone publicly traded systematic manager. The BrightSphere chapter closed at the end of last year. And today, I’m delighted to share Acadian’s results for the fourth quarter and to update you on our long-term growth strategy. Since this is the first Acadian’s earnings call, I’ll also introduce you to Acadian’s CIO, Brendan Bradley, and Brendan will walk you through our investment performance. Finally, Melody Huang will close with an update on our capital allocation. And after my closing remarks, we’ll move to Q&A. I’m happy to report that we ended 2024 on a high note. During Q4, AAMI achieved the highest level of quarterly ENI EPS in the firm’s history. ENI per share was $1.30 compared to $0.77 in the fourth quarter of 2023. The 69% increase in ENI per share compared to the year ago quarter was primarily driven by 50% growth in ENI. And ENI for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $49 million, a $16 million increase from prior year, primarily driven by higher ENI management fee revenue and higher incentive fees. Adjusted EBITDA of $73 million was up 41% from Q4 of 2023. Higher AUM from both market appreciation and investment returns over the last 12 months also drove the full year 2024 ENI and adjusted EBITDA increase. Acadian’s 2024 ENI was $106 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $177 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, a 40% and 32% increase, respectively, from the prior year. Record ENI EPS of $2.76 for the full year represented a 55% increase compared to 2023 and was additionally driven by the company’s accretive share repurchases. Net client cash flows for the fourth quarter of 2024 were positive by $900 million, as Acadian continued to produce consecutive quarters of net inflows. Total positive NCCF were $1.8 billion in 2024, the first positive annual net flow since 2019, which was driven by Acadian’s highest ever gross sales year of $21 billion in 2024. This success is a testament of our proven investment process as well as Acadian’s world-class investment and distribution teams. As a systematic investing pioneer, Acadian was among the first firms in the world to apply data and technology to the systematic evaluation of global assets. This edge enables Acadian to deliver strong risk-adjusted returns that help our clients meet their long-term investment goals. Now, let me introduce you to our Chief Investment Officer, Brendan Bradley, who’s going to walk you through Acadian’s investment performance this quarter.\nBrendan Bradley: Thanks, Kelly. While markets were mixed in Q4, with much of the equity world losing value, the U.S. market continued its strong year. Around the globe, equities did well with most major markets realizing double-digit returns in local currency. U.S. high-yield and investment-grade bonds had a positive year, as credit spreads tightened and yields rose. Overall, MSCI World was up 19%, while EV was up 4% and MSCI Emerging Markets was up 8% in dollar terms. U.S. equities led the way, and within the U.S., it was the continued strength of a small number of large technology-oriented companies driving the market. In a year in which over half the world’s population went to the polls, equity markets remained resilient and Acadian’s investment process delivered strong performance across nearly all our strategies. While Q4 saw most equity markets giving back, our relative performance was particularly strong, adding over 300 basis points in active performance in our core benchmark-oriented strategies. It was a great finish to a great year. In 2024, nearly every strategy and every geography added significant value for our clients. Our performance was highly diversified across our universe of signals ended most major strategies between 80% and 100% of our major signal categories contributed positively to value add. Over the long-term, our systematic investment process has created significant value for our clients. In five major implementations comprising the majority of our assets, 100% of our strategies are outperforming their respective benchmarks for the 3, 5 and 10-year windows ending in 2024. On the consolidated basis, as of December 31, 2024, more than 90% of our strategies by revenue outperformed their respective benchmarks over these three, five and ten-year period, and more than 89% of our strategies by assets outperformed their respective benchmarks. We generated annualized excess returns of approximately 4% in the most recent five years for our clients. In short, Acadian had another outstanding active quarter and year. Back to you, Kelly.\nKelly Young: Thanks, Brendan. Next, I’d like to focus on Acadian’s robust distribution platform and team, which helped Acadian generate record gross sales in 2024 and will be a major driver of growth in the years ahead. For many years, Acadian has had a strong global presence with offices in Boston, London, Sydney and Singapore. We have continued to expand our client and distribution team with over 90 experienced professionals serving more than 1,000 accounts in 40 countries. The team has established strong long-term relationships with many institutional clients and consultants across both market segments and geographies, leading to a diverse client base with deep relationships dating back many years and in many cases, across multiple strategies. In tandem, with expanding our distribution capabilities, Acadian’s business and product development teams have been focused on increasing our strategy and vehicle offerings in high demand and growing areas where Acadian’s systematic approach is particularly well suited, and our current pipeline is very robust. Looking ahead, there are four key product initiatives in addition to our core strategies that we expect will drive Acadian’s future growth. In no particular order, these are our enhanced equity, our extensions equity, systematic credit and equity alternatives platforms, and we’ve made excellent progress in each of these endeavors. Our enhanced strategies drove a lot of our asset raising in 2024. Enhanced equity strategies offer risk-adjusted returns with comparatively lower active risk relative to standard active offerings. These strategies can satisfy broader investment demand for lower fee, more consistent return allocations as well as providing alternatives for investors in a $16 trillion passive market, and we expect to see strong momentum in this space going forward. Our extension portfolios are a form of high-conviction investing, which leverage both long and short positions to increase and manages active views. An example would be our 130-30 product. Acadian has years of extension experience and our alpha is effective for both long and short positions. These strategies have excellent returns and have seen some major new accounts funded recently. On systematic credit, we have three live track records: U.S. high-yield, global high-yield and U.S. investment grade, with the first offering ceded in Q4 of 2023. We believe our data infrastructure, systematic platform and culture of transparency will produce excellent results for Acadian’s credit products and enable us to access the $3 trillion active corporate credit space. We recently onboarded our first external client assets in credit, and we will continue to incubate our track records. Finally, Acadian’s equity alternative strategies are targeting the multi-strategy hedge fund market, one of the fastest-growing segments of the global hedge fund industry. We are producing high returns with low market correlations and have already gathered external assets in this strategy. To sum up. Over time, we expect these fou initiatives, enhanced, extensions, credit and equity alternatives to help generate sustained growth for Acadian, while we continue to deliver strong returns on our core offerings which include global, non-U.S., emerging markets and small cap equities. I’m now delighted to turn the call over to Melody to provide you with an update on capital allocation.\nMelody Huang: Thanks, Kelly. Our balance sheet provides the liquidity and financial flexibility to execute our growth strategy and to enhance shareholder value. At the end of fourth quarter 2024, we have $95 million in cash and $90 million in seed investments. With approximately $274 million of long-term debt and nothing drawn on our $140 million revolving credit facility, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.5 times as of 12/31/2024, and our net leverage ratio was just 1 times as of 12/31/2024. Over the past five years, we demonstrated a track record of creating significant value to our shareholders through returning $1.4 billion of excess capital. Outstanding diluted shares went down 56% from 86 million in Q4 2019 to 38 million shares in Q4 2024. Share buybacks were not only highly accretive to EPS growth, but also very tax efficient. As our business continues to generate strong free cash flow, we expect to continue deploying excess capital to support our organic growth and to buy back our shares whenever opportunities come up. Now Kelly will deliver her closing remarks.\nKelly Young: Thanks, Melody. Before going into Q&A, I’d like to recap the key points we’ve covered in this presentation. We’re the only stand-alone publicly traded systematic manager. Our results were outstanding in the fourth quarter and full year of 2024 with ENI EPS growth of 69% and 55%, respectively. $1.8 billion of net cash flows were generated in 2024, the first positive year since 2019. Our track record is robust. More than 90% of Acadian’s strategies by revenue outperformed their respective benchmarks across the three, five and ten-year period. Acadian is currently only trading at around 9 times 2024 earnings while our peers’ average PE multiple is at approximately 14 times. With exceptional investment performance and several organic growth initiatives well in place, Acadian is positioned for meaningful growth, and I’m truly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. This concludes my prepared remarks, and I’ll turn the call back to the operator, and we’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have.\nOperator: Thanks, Kelly. [Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first question today comes from the line of Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital. Kenneth, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKenneth Lee: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just want to get a better sense of whether there are any specific strategies that drove the positive net flows that you saw in the quarter there? Thanks, again.\nKelly Young: Hi, Kenneth, it’s nice to speak to you, again. Yes, I think what was really exciting about Q4 sales and sales for 2024 was actually the breadth of strategies that we saw clients funding. We’ve seen clear growth in both enhanced equities and our extension strategies recently, but also saw substantial assets moving into a number of our sort of more traditional core strategies as well where we are gaining market share in a number of areas. So it was pretty broadening in Q4, but with those themes of enhanced extensions being sort of two of the more prevalent.\nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful there. And just on that, and thanks again for the additional details around some of the newer systematic strategies, the enhanced equity, the systematic credit, the equity alternatives. I wonder if you could just help us frame out the longer-term AUM opportunity, specifically for Acadian for these kind of strategies, how much growth could you see AUM grow over time there? And then somewhat relatedly, what’s sort of the fee rate opportunity here? Is it typical fee rate a little bit higher or lower than the average fee rate that you’re seeing currently for Acadian? Thanks.\nKelly Young: Sure. Yes. We’re very pleased, I think, with the progress that we’ve made in both of those initiatives. And we’re in a strong position. I don’t anticipate any sort of additional investments really needed for those. We’re obviously still in the period of incubating both of those track records of building longer-term tracks there. But I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, there’s a very, very large credit market. Systematic credit is certainly something more newer and more nascent. But we think the opportunities there really could be substantial over time, sort of large mandates that we would expect to see there as we continue to incubate those track records. On the equity alternatives platform, again, multi-strategy has been a very popular area, I think, over the last few years in the market. And as we continue to build, I think, a strong compelling offering there, again, we think there’s sort of substantial upside in terms of AUM growth. So hard to put sort of firm numbers on those. But again, I think we feel very positive about the opportunities in both of those. With respect to fees, certainly, on the credit side, you would expect to see sort of fees, I think, would in terms of the blended fee that we see for average fees across the business, perhaps a little lower there. But again, I think that’s certainly going to depend on the dynamics and where we see flows coming into across the credit business. Equity alternatives and the hedge fund platform, again, you would see – expect to see much higher average fees there versus what we see in our more sort of traditional core strategy. So I think we feel very positive about both AUM potential growth there as well as excited about the impact on revenue and certainly for the equity alternatives platform.\nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful there. And just one last one, if I could squeeze one in. Given the cash on balance sheet, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about potential cash needs for this coming year and I think you have an upcoming note maturity as well, any plans around that? Thanks.\nKelly Young: Sure. Yes. As you know, I mean, the balance sheet is very strong, and the business generates very good free cash flow. So it gives us financial flexibility to whether it’s to fund those organic growth strategies, returning capital to shareholders and paying down debt. So we haven’t got pre-allocations in mind. As you noted, the senior note matures next year, we’ll start looking into refinancing options for that note. And want to be prudent in terms of maintaining good leverage ratios and financial flexibility there and obviously focusing on what makes most sense for shareholder value.\nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful. Thanks again.\nKelly Young: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. [Operator Instructions] All right. It looks like we do have another question, and it is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is live.\nAnnalei Davis: Hi, this is Annalei on for Mike. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you could maybe provide some color on composition and the magnitude of the pipeline, maybe frame that how – frame that versus how it was like 3 months to 6 months ago? Thanks.\nKelly Young: Sure. Thanks, Annalei. Yes, we have a very strong robust pipeline, I’d say, across a number of different strategies and a very strong one not funded pipeline that we expect to see those clients fund over the next, I’d say, one to two quarters. We’ve seen the pipeline pick up quite significantly, I’d say, through the second half of 2024 going into 2025. And again, I think the theme you’re going to see are going to be consistent with my prepared remarks earlier that enhanced and extension to two areas where we continue to see areas of focus for clients. But again, our traditional core equity strategies and certainly in some of our more niche areas like small cap are proving very popular and gaining a lot of attention. So I’d say the pipeline looks incredibly robust, perhaps more robust even than six months ago when we felt very positive going into the second half of last year. And as I said, across the breadth of strategies, which from our point of view, from the diversification point of view is really nice to see.\nAnnalei Davis: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: All right. Thank you so much, Annalei. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference call back to Kelly Young. Kelly?\nKelly Young: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for taking the time today. Have a good day.",

During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, February 6, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. I would now like to turn the call over to Melody Huang, Senior Vice President and Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Melody.\nMelody Huang: Good morning, and welcome to Acadian Asset Management Inc.’s conference call to discuss our results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024. Before we get started, please note that we may make forward-looking statements about our business and financial performance. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties appears in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing the earnings release, our 2023 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q for each of the first, second, and third quarters of 2024. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them as a result of new information or future events. We may also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Finally, nothing herein shall be deemed to be an offer a solicitation to buy any investment products. Kelly Young, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead the call. And now I’m pleased to turn the call over to Kelly.\nKelly Young: Thanks, Melody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I take on the role of CEO of Acadian Asset Management Inc., I’m mindful of the incredible journey that has brought us here. Acadian has been around for nearly 40 years. And for most of that time, we’ve been under the umbrella and brand name of another holding company, but today marks the first time that Acadian releases earnings as a stand-alone company. Our firm has been built on an impressive performance track record through various market cycles. We have a stellar reputation among institutional investors, and we’re the only stand-alone publicly traded systematic manager. The BrightSphere chapter closed at the end of last year. And today, I’m delighted to share Acadian’s results for the fourth quarter and to update you on our long-term growth strategy. Since this is the first Acadian’s earnings call, I’ll also introduce you to Acadian’s CIO, Brendan Bradley, and Brendan will walk you through our investment performance. Finally, Melody Huang will close with an update on our capital allocation. And after my closing remarks, we’ll move to Q&A. I’m happy to report that we ended 2024 on a high note. During Q4, AAMI achieved the highest level of quarterly ENI EPS in the firm’s history. ENI per share was $1.30 compared to $0.77 in the fourth quarter of 2023. The 69% increase in ENI per share compared to the year ago quarter was primarily driven by 50% growth in ENI. And ENI for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $49 million, a $16 million increase from prior year, primarily driven by higher ENI management fee revenue and higher incentive fees. Adjusted EBITDA of $73 million was up 41% from Q4 of 2023. Higher AUM from both market appreciation and investment returns over the last 12 months also drove the full year 2024 ENI and adjusted EBITDA increase. Acadian’s 2024 ENI was $106 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $177 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, a 40% and 32% increase, respectively, from the prior year. Record ENI EPS of $2.76 for the full year represented a 55% increase compared to 2023 and was additionally driven by the company’s accretive share repurchases. Net client cash flows for the fourth quarter of 2024 were positive by $900 million, as Acadian continued to produce consecutive quarters of net inflows. Total positive NCCF were $1.8 billion in 2024, the first positive annual net flow since 2019, which was driven by Acadian’s highest ever gross sales year of $21 billion in 2024. This success is a testament of our proven investment process as well as Acadian’s world-class investment and distribution teams. As a systematic investing pioneer, Acadian was among the first firms in the world to apply data and technology to the systematic evaluation of global assets. This edge enables Acadian to deliver strong risk-adjusted returns that help our clients meet their long-term investment goals. Now, let me introduce you to our Chief Investment Officer, Brendan Bradley, who’s going to walk you through Acadian’s investment performance this quarter.\nBrendan Bradley: Thanks, Kelly. While markets were mixed in Q4, with much of the equity world losing value, the U.S. market continued its strong year. Around the globe, equities did well with most major markets realizing double-digit returns in local currency. U.S. high-yield and investment-grade bonds had a positive year, as credit spreads tightened and yields rose. Overall, MSCI World was up 19%, while EV was up 4% and MSCI Emerging Markets was up 8% in dollar terms. U.S. equities led the way, and within the U.S., it was the continued strength of a small number of large technology-oriented companies driving the market. In a year in which over half the world’s population went to the polls, equity markets remained resilient and Acadian’s investment process delivered strong performance across nearly all our strategies. While Q4 saw most equity markets giving back, our relative performance was particularly strong, adding over 300 basis points in active performance in our core benchmark-oriented strategies. It was a great finish to a great year. In 2024, nearly every strategy and every geography added significant value for our clients. Our performance was highly diversified across our universe of signals ended most major strategies between 80% and 100% of our major signal categories contributed positively to value add. Over the long-term, our systematic investment process has created significant value for our clients. In five major implementations comprising the majority of our assets, 100% of our strategies are outperforming their respective benchmarks for the 3, 5 and 10-year windows ending in 2024. On the consolidated basis, as of December 31, 2024, more than 90% of our strategies by revenue outperformed their respective benchmarks over these three, five and ten-year period, and more than 89% of our strategies by assets outperformed their respective benchmarks. We generated annualized excess returns of approximately 4% in the most recent five years for our clients. In short, Acadian had another outstanding active quarter and year. Back to you, Kelly.\nKelly Young: Thanks, Brendan. Next, I’d like to focus on Acadian’s robust distribution platform and team, which helped Acadian generate record gross sales in 2024 and will be a major driver of growth in the years ahead. For many years, Acadian has had a strong global presence with offices in Boston, London, Sydney and Singapore. We have continued to expand our client and distribution team with over 90 experienced professionals serving more than 1,000 accounts in 40 countries. The team has established strong long-term relationships with many institutional clients and consultants across both market segments and geographies, leading to a diverse client base with deep relationships dating back many years and in many cases, across multiple strategies. In tandem, with expanding our distribution capabilities, Acadian’s business and product development teams have been focused on increasing our strategy and vehicle offerings in high demand and growing areas where Acadian’s systematic approach is particularly well suited, and our current pipeline is very robust. Looking ahead, there are four key product initiatives in addition to our core strategies that we expect will drive Acadian’s future growth. In no particular order, these are our enhanced equity, our extensions equity, systematic credit and equity alternatives platforms, and we’ve made excellent progress in each of these endeavors. Our enhanced strategies drove a lot of our asset raising in 2024. Enhanced equity strategies offer risk-adjusted returns with comparatively lower active risk relative to standard active offerings. These strategies can satisfy broader investment demand for lower fee, more consistent return allocations as well as providing alternatives for investors in a $16 trillion passive market, and we expect to see strong momentum in this space going forward. Our extension portfolios are a form of high-conviction investing, which leverage both long and short positions to increase and manages active views. An example would be our 130-30 product. Acadian has years of extension experience and our alpha is effective for both long and short positions. These strategies have excellent returns and have seen some major new accounts funded recently. On systematic credit, we have three live track records: U.S. high-yield, global high-yield and U.S. investment grade, with the first offering ceded in Q4 of 2023. We believe our data infrastructure, systematic platform and culture of transparency will produce excellent results for Acadian’s credit products and enable us to access the $3 trillion active corporate credit space. We recently onboarded our first external client assets in credit, and we will continue to incubate our track records. Finally, Acadian’s equity alternative strategies are targeting the multi-strategy hedge fund market, one of the fastest-growing segments of the global hedge fund industry. We are producing high returns with low market correlations and have already gathered external assets in this strategy. To sum up. Over time, we expect these fou initiatives, enhanced, extensions, credit and equity alternatives to help generate sustained growth for Acadian, while we continue to deliver strong returns on our core offerings which include global, non-U.S., emerging markets and small cap equities. I’m now delighted to turn the call over to Melody to provide you with an update on capital allocation.\nMelody Huang: Thanks, Kelly. Our balance sheet provides the liquidity and financial flexibility to execute our growth strategy and to enhance shareholder value. At the end of fourth quarter 2024, we have $95 million in cash and $90 million in seed investments. With approximately $274 million of long-term debt and nothing drawn on our $140 million revolving credit facility, our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.5 times as of 12/31/2024, and our net leverage ratio was just 1 times as of 12/31/2024. Over the past five years, we demonstrated a track record of creating significant value to our shareholders through returning $1.4 billion of excess capital. Outstanding diluted shares went down 56% from 86 million in Q4 2019 to 38 million shares in Q4 2024. Share buybacks were not only highly accretive to EPS growth, but also very tax efficient. As our business continues to generate strong free cash flow, we expect to continue deploying excess capital to support our organic growth and to buy back our shares whenever opportunities come up. Now Kelly will deliver her closing remarks.\nKelly Young: Thanks, Melody. Before going into Q&A, I’d like to recap the key points we’ve covered in this presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, October 31, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Melody Huang, SVP, Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Melody.\nMelody Huang: Good morning and welcome to BrightSphere’s conference call to discuss our results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Before we get started, please note that we may make forward-looking statements about our business and financial performance. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties appears in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing the earnings release, our 2023 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q for the first and second quarter of 2024. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them as a result of new information or future events. We may also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information about any non-GAAP measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can be found on our website, along with the slides that we will use as part of today’s discussion. Finally, nothing herein shall be deemed to be an offer or solicitation to buy any investment products. Suren Rana, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead the call. And now I’m pleased to turn the call over to Suren.\nSuren Rana: Thank you, Melody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I’ll cover the highlights on Slide 5 of the deck in my initial remarks, and then we can move to Q&A. So for the third quarter of 2024, we reported ENI per share of $0.59, and compared to $0.45 in the third quarter of 2023 and also $0.45 in the second quarter of 2024. The ENI in the third quarter of 2024, increased by 15%, $22.2 million compared to $19.3 million a year ago in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the growth in management fee revenue due to higher AUM from the market appreciation that we’ve seen over the last 12 months. And additionally, we continued our expense discipline during this period. The ENI per share increased by 31% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the year ago quarter, which is higher than the 15% increase in ENI over the same period. And that’s because the ENI per share was additionally driven by the $100 million of share repurchases that we started in December ‘23 and continued in the first half of 2024. Acadian investment performance remained very strong in the quarter. As of September 30, 2024, 85%, 93% and 94% of Acadian strategies by revenue, outperformed their respective benchmarks across 3, 5 and 10-year periods. Turning to flows. We reported positive net client cash flows of $0.5 billion this quarter compared to the breakeven NCCF we had in the second quarter of 2024, and negative $0.5 billion of NCCF that we had in the third quarter of 2023. Our organic growth initiatives continue to progress well and in line with our expectations. On our systematic credit initiative, all three credit strategies seeded so far are building nice track records. As a reminder, these three strategies comprise U.S. high-yield strategy, which we seeded in November 2023, global high-yield strategy seeded in April 2024 and U.S. investment-grade strategy seeded in Q3 of 2024. On our equity alternatives initiative, our multi-strategy fund seeded about 2 years ago in Q4 of ‘22, continues to build a strong track record of outperformance. And in September ‘24, we also seeded a new global equity extension strategy, which is a variant of our global equity strategy with some ability to go short. Turning to capital management. At the end of the third quarter, we had a cash balance of approximately $53.6 million, and Acadian has fully paid down its revolving facility compared to the outstanding balance of $36 million at the end of the second quarter. As discussed previously, this revolving facility supports Acadian’s first quarter seasonal needs and is generally paid down fully by year-end from the cash generated from Acadian’s operations. Now as we announced earlier this month, this will be my last earnings call as BrightSphere CEO. Effective 1Q ‘25, we will rebrand BrightSphere as Acadian Asset Management since Acadian is our only remaining business. Our current ticker, BSIG will change to AAMI and Kelly Young, who is currently the CEO of Acadian our sole operating business will assume the role of the public company CEO, too. These steps basically complete our transition from a multi-boutique conglomerate to a streamlined and singularly focused asset manager. We successfully sold 6 of the company’s 7 affiliates, the strategic acquirers and retain Acadian, our largest and the most differentiated business. Thanks to the divestitures, we returned $1.3 billion of capital to the shareholders via share buyback, and we also paid down $125 million of debt. We expanded Acadian’s business into new areas, including credit and equity alternatives that I touched on earlier. And we expect these new asset classes to generate sustained organic growth for the company over time. And we also reduced our corporate overhead by approximately 70% over the last few years. Collectively, these efforts have produced very strong returns for our shareholders. Now Acadian is one of the top-performing systematic investment managers in the world and the completion of the transition to a singularly focused asset management company presents an exciting opportunity to focus exclusively on this exceptional business. I’d like to close my initial remarks by reiterating as I’ve done for about ‘24 quarters now, but the company will remain focused on maximizing shareholder value, and will continue using its free cash flow to support organic growth and to buy back of shares. I’ll now turn the call back to the operator, and I’m happy to answer questions at this point.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Kenneth Lee of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Lee: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and Suren, it’s been great working with you for the past several years. In terms of the transition, and I think you also mentioned the streamlining of the company structure. And once again, I appreciate that the BrightSphere had gone some – had undergone some major cost reductions in the past. Do you think there is any potential opportunities for any further expense reductions going forward as the structure gets streamlined? Thanks.\nSuren Rana: Hi, Ken. Yes, as we’ve always said, we maintain expense discipline, and we continue to find opportunities, and we continue to be really laser-focused on being as efficient as we can be. So going forward, we’ll continue the same approach, but it’s hard to say at this point whether there are any obvious opportunities. As we’ve talked about last 2 years, we’ve actually been investing in the infrastructure we’ve upgraded our investor reporting capabilities. We’ve invested in our trading capabilities. And so what that will do is that it makes our platform much more scalable. And we also face the inflation pressures that we’ve touched on. So what I would say is that at this point, we’ve built up a lot over the last couple of years. So we may not see expense growth necessarily as our revenue grows. So we would see the benefit of operating leverage going forward. But it’s hard to say whether that would be reduction sort of in absolute dollar terms of the expense levels.\nKenneth Lee: Got it. Very helpful there. And just one follow-up, if I may. Just wanted to see if you could just give us an updated outlook in terms of potential cash usage for the remainder of this year and as well related to that, what’s sort of like the outlook for share repurchases over the near-term there? Thanks.\nSuren Rana: Yes. Thank you. At a high level, as I just said earlier, the two primary uses for our cash haven’t changed. And as I understand, even at the – after the end of my tenure, they won’t change. So they remain investment in our organic growth on seeding new strategies and then share repurchases. Between the two, it would sort of really would have to be opportunistic and see what opportunities present themselves, whether in terms of opportunity to seed something if the client is looking for a new product from us and also being vigilant about market conditions and with regard to share repurchases. So it’s hard to put sort of a relative prioritization of the two, but those two remain the primary and I would say, almost exclusive uses for the cash.\nKenneth Lee: Got you. Very helpful there. Thanks again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Dunn of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJohn Dunn: Hi, Suren. Could you maybe give us a little update on the institutional pipeline, like composition, magnitude, time to funding, maybe geography?\nSuren Rana: Hi, John. Yes, I guess, we are pleased with the pipeline. Of course, as we saw in the numbers in the third quarter, the pipeline has been good and we are working through it. And as it sort of progresses, some of it has been converting into sales. So – and it’s pretty healthy, it’s pretty robust, and it goes across – you said, John, it goes across geographies, it goes across strategies. So it’s not concentrated in any particular areas. And we are also seeing good response from some of the newer areas like we have an enhanced strategy that has a low – essentially that offers a low tracking error to indices, but also with low risk. So I think we are happy with how things are going in the pipeline. Also, we saw some outflows from managed volatility in this quarter as well. So we have pockets of risk as well. So I would say on balance, we were satisfied with where things are that we expect essentially ideally be positive flows or maybe breakeven as we look forward to next few quarters.\nJohn Dunn: Got it. And then you’ve done some new product launches, but maybe thinking about the next phase, is there kind of like another crop of areas where you would consider maybe going into as like the next phase of growth?\nSuren Rana: Yes. We’ll always remain opportunistic and see if there are opportunities to see any new asset classes. But I would say we do have our hands full at the moment. We’re definitely – the areas that we’re looking to expand into credit and equity alternative, and we’ve got some other product variance in the mix. These are large markets, and we are really keeping our eye on the ball and actually going quarter-to-quarter in terms of building out the necessary capabilities and starting to talk to clients. So I would say, we will definitely focus on what we have already in the hopper. Opportunistically, something great comes along, we’ll look at it, but we want to stay disciplined on execution, too.\nJohn Dunn: Make sense. Thank you and all the best, Suren.\nSuren Rana: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi, good morning, Suren. Congratulations on your tenure with BrightSphere and the strong execution on unlocking value for shareholders over the past number of years. It’s been great working with you. I wish you all the best in your new endeavors. Just a couple of questions here, just curious in your dialogue with the Board, among others, maybe you could just elaborate a bit on the new strategy, what prompted it? And what is the scope for strategic alternatives from here? In the past, you guys have looked to pursue maybe potential buyers. Just curious what the reception feedback has been, it seems like the change in strategy is moving on from the strategic alternatives chapter to the organic growth chapter next?\nSuren Rana: Yes. Thank you for the kind words, Mike. Appreciate it. And I would say there is really nothing new, I would say. There isn’t necessarily a change of strategy because as we have said for a while, right, that we remain focused on maximizing shareholder value and looking at all possible ways that we can do that. So, that strategy remains the same where the company remains open to strategic alternatives. So, I wouldn’t say that’s no longer an option or that’s off the table. What we have done over the last few years, has really sort of moved from the conglomerate approach to really a singular integrated asset management approach, right. And then this is the sort of the most unique and well positioned business to do that with. So, we – and we accomplished this almost 1.5 years ago. And then we have remained open to strategic alternatives, but of course, the partner has to be right. And at the same time, we have continued to optimize our position as an independent public company and continue to be disciplined on expense and we have had leadership succession at Acadian in the interim as we updated. And so we have been really continuing to be optimized on all fronts as an independent public company as well as we remain open to strategic alternatives. So, I would say nothing has changed, but this is just a continued execution of that strategy we have had for a while, and this is sort of in a way of culmination of that effort. Going forward, the company is very well positioned as an independent company, but also open to if something synergistic came along that creates shareholder value, the company remains open to that.\nMichael Cyprys: And then could you just elaborate a bit on the traction that you are seeing with some of the new strategies that you have been seeing over the past couple of years, just where you are in terms of third-party client assets, traction, interest from clients and how you are thinking about the scope for maybe bringing some newer strategies to the marketplace over the next year or so?\nSuren Rana: Yes, certainly. So, I would say the new strategies have been moving along completely on expected lines. Now and I appreciate that looking from outside and it’s sort of really hard to tell what’s been going on because with anything new, when you can’t see necessarily a lot of flows, it’s hard to tell. But with new strategies in our institutional long-only asset management business, it is the length of the track record is quite important before we start to see meaningful sales numbers. But the execution has been going along well and kind of more or less on the lines we expected, that we have built the teams, we have built the models, we have built our necessary technological changes we had to do. And we have been having great conversations with clients who have taken a lot of interest, but just a quite a variety of reasons, their internal thresholds etcetera, people have requirements to see a certain duration, a certain length of track record. So, I would say that these – there is nothing to – there is nothing that we are concerned about on the new strategy. It’s just moving along, things take awfully long in terms of coming up with new strategies that over time build scale. So, that’s what – I would say that we continue to stay focused on all of these new strategies, and we are happy with how the execution is going. So, it’s not that we would want to then start new strategies because we are unhappy with what we are doing right now. But we remain opportunistic, as I said, that if something compelling were to come from either from client feedback or market opportunities present themselves, the company remains open to seeding new strategies as well. But we do have enough in the pipeline right now.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And then just one follow-up question just on capital allocation, I know you mentioned that you look to be opportunistic on the buyback, also looking to seed. As we think about into ‘25, just curious how we should think about usage of cash generated across the business that you look for [Technical Difficulty] versus how much might we see of cash flow deployed into buybacks versus seeding new strategies or otherwise just cash building or other uses? Maybe you could help flesh that out.\nSuren Rana: Yes. I mean those two are the uses. And it’s really – yes, we haven’t made any sort of predetermined allocation between the two. We do remain opportunistic. And it will be a function of the market conditions with regard to the buyback opportunity and just sort of – and how we see sort of client feedback with regard to any new strategies and how big those markets are, we – I said we have enough to digest on the organic side right now. There may be some, one or two things that may come up, but it may not be very sizable, at least nothing that we know of that would be very large. And so I would say that you may probably see both of them with regard to the relative allocation between the two that it’s hard to tell.\nMichael Cyprys: Okay. Thanks. [Technical Difficulty] Wish you all the best.\nSuren Rana: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Lee: Hey. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just wanted to get a better sense of what specific strategies drove net flows in the quarter there. Thanks.\nSuren Rana: Yes. They really came from – I mean it’s a good cross-section of strategies that did that, but one of them, for example, just to touch on is, as I mentioned, we have some new variants as well. So, one of them is enhanced whereby we offer low tracking error with low risk, and that’s resonated with clients that were otherwise going passive. So, that was one area, for example. We have seen good interest in small-cap equity, non-U.S. as well as U.S. and those are high fee as well. So, that’s a nice side benefit. And we also saw interest in emerging markets, small cap opportunities. So, it’s been across a variety of strategies.\nKenneth Lee: Got it. Thank you again for taking my follow-up.\nSuren Rana: Thank you, Ken.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Suren Rana.\nSuren Rana: Thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us, and thank you also for the kind words. It’s a better [ph] moment for me. As I mentioned, on the one hand, it’s really been a culmination of the strategy that we have been executing for the last few years. But also at the same time, it is an exciting new phase as a more streamlined independent public company. And I leave with the knowledge that the company was very well positioned without me. Thank you everyone for joining us.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, October 31, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Melody Huang, SVP, Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Melody.\nMelody Huang: Good morning and welcome to BrightSphere’s conference call to discuss our results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Before we get started, please note that we may make forward-looking statements about our business and financial performance. Each forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties appears in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing the earnings release, our 2023 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q for the first and second quarter of 2024. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them as a result of new information or future events. We may also reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information about any non-GAAP measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can be found on our website, along with the slides that we will use as part of today’s discussion. Finally, nothing herein shall be deemed to be an offer or solicitation to buy any investment products. Suren Rana, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead the call. And now I’m pleased to turn the call over to Suren.\nSuren Rana: Thank you, Melody. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I’ll cover the highlights on Slide 5 of the deck in my initial remarks, and then we can move to Q&A. So for the third quarter of 2024, we reported ENI per share of $0.59, and compared to $0.45 in the third quarter of 2023 and also $0.45 in the second quarter of 2024. The ENI in the third quarter of 2024, increased by 15%, $22.2 million compared to $19.3 million a year ago in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the growth in management fee revenue due to higher AUM from the market appreciation that we’ve seen over the last 12 months. And additionally, we continued our expense discipline during this period. The ENI per share increased by 31% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the year ago quarter, which is higher than the 15% increase in ENI over the same period. And that’s because the ENI per share was additionally driven by the $100 million of share repurchases that we started in December ‘23 and continued in the first half of 2024. Acadian investment performance remained very strong in the quarter. As of September 30, 2024, 85%, 93% and 94% of Acadian strategies by revenue, outperformed their respective benchmarks across 3, 5 and 10-year periods. Turning to flows. We reported positive net client cash flows of $0.5 billion this quarter compared to the breakeven NCCF we had in the second quarter of 2024, and negative $0.5 billion of NCCF that we had in the third quarter of 2023. Our organic growth initiatives continue to progress well and in line with our expectations. On our systematic credit initiative, all three credit strategies seeded so far are building nice track records. As a reminder, these three strategies comprise U.S. high-yield strategy, which we seeded in November 2023, global high-yield strategy seeded in April 2024 and U.S. investment-grade strategy seeded in Q3 of 2024. On our equity alternatives initiative, our multi-strategy fund seeded about 2 years ago in Q4 of ‘22, continues to build a strong track record of outperformance. And in September ‘24, we also seeded a new global equity extension strategy, which is a variant of our global equity strategy with some ability to go short. Turning to capital management. At the end of the third quarter, we had a cash balance of approximately $53.6 million, and Acadian has fully paid down its revolving facility compared to the outstanding balance of $36 million at the end of the second quarter. As discussed previously, this revolving facility supports Acadian’s first quarter seasonal needs and is generally paid down fully by year-end from the cash generated from Acadian’s operations. Now as we announced earlier this month, this will be my last earnings call as BrightSphere CEO. Effective 1Q ‘25, we will rebrand BrightSphere as Acadian Asset Management since Acadian is our only remaining business. Our current ticker, BSIG will change to AAMI and Kelly Young, who is currently the CEO of Acadian our sole operating business will assume the role of the public company CEO, too. These steps basically complete our transition from a multi-boutique conglomerate to a streamlined and singularly focused asset manager. We successfully sold 6 of the company’s 7 affiliates, the strategic acquirers and retain Acadian, our largest and the most differentiated business. Thanks to the divestitures, we returned $1.3 billion of capital to the shareholders via share buyback, and we also paid down $125 million of debt. We expanded Acadian’s business into new areas, including credit and equity alternatives that I touched on earlier. And we expect these new asset classes to generate sustained organic growth for the company over time. And we also reduced our corporate overhead by approximately 70% over the last few years. Collectively, these efforts have produced very strong returns for our shareholders. Now Acadian is one of the top-performing systematic investment managers in the world and the completion of the transition to a singularly focused asset management company presents an exciting opportunity to focus exclusively on this exceptional business. I’d like to close my initial remarks by reiterating as I’ve done for about ‘24 quarters now, but the company will remain focused on maximizing shareholder value, and will continue using its free cash flow to support organic growth and to buy back of shares.

So, for the second quarter of 2024, we reported ENI per share of $0.45, compared to $0.28 in the second quarter of 2023, and $0.44 in the first quarter of 2024. The 61% increase in ENI per share compared to the year-ago quarter was primarily driven by increase in management fee revenue due to higher AUM from the market appreciation that we saw over the last 12 months. And secondly, it was also driven by our share repurchases over the last few quarters. Our average AUM increased approximately 13% compared to the second quarter of 2023. And management fee revenue increased 14%, in line with the AUM increase. However, since we were able to keep our operating expenses generally flat year-over-year, our ENI increased 43% because of the 14% increase in revenue. With this proportionate increase in ENI versus revenue increase, reflects our continued expense discipline and the embedded operating leverage in our business. We would expect to continue to benefit from this operating leverage as our revenue growth. Additionally, the increase in ENI per share versus year-ago was 61% compared to the 43% increase in ENI that I just went through. And that difference was driven by our share repurchases over the last year. Between December 2023 and June of 2024, we repurchased 4.7 million of our shares, or 11% of our total outstanding shares, for $100 million. Acadian's investment performance remains great. As of June 30, 2024, 86%, 92%, and 93% of Acadian's strategies by revenue outperformed their respective benchmarks across three, five, and 10-year period. Turning to flows, net client cash flows were incidentally flat for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we had select large and lumpy inflows, but we also had select large and lumpy outflows. And these lumpy flows basically offset each other. Our growth initiatives continue to progress. On our systematic credit initiatives, Acadian's U.S. High Yield strategy, that was seeded in November, 2023, and the Global High Yield strategy, seeded more recently in April of 2024, both continue to build good track records. Additionally, we just seeded a third Credit strategy, U.S. Investment Grade strategy in July 2024, and that strategy is also building a track record now. On our Equity Alternatives initiative, our multi-strategy fund seeded in Q4 of '22, continues to build a strong track record of outperformance. Turning to capital management, as I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 11% of our outstanding shares since December of 2023 for $100 million. Specifically in Q2 of '24, we repurchased 0.9 million shares or 2% of our total outstanding shares for $21 million. At the end of second quarter, we had a cash balance of $72 million. And Acadian had an outstanding balance of $36 million on their revolving credit facility which, similar to prior-year, is expected to be repaid fully from cash from operations by year end. I'd like to close my initial remarks by reiterating, as I usually do, that we remain focused on maximizing shareholder value, and will continue using our free cash flow to support organic growth, and to buy back our shares. I'll now turn the call back to the operator, and I'm happy to answer questions at this point. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you. Good morning. Maybe just starting out with the lumpy flows that you alluded on both the gross sales and the redemption side, was hoping you could unpack both of those, maybe talk about some of the types of strategies, customer channels, et cetera, where you're seeing some of the [strays] (ph) come in, and similarly on the redemption side, what you're seeing there? And if you could also just touch upon the pipeline as it looks today, how is that shaping up versus, say, last quarter? Thank you.\nSuren Rana: Yes, thanks, Michael. As we've touched on, ours is an institutional business, and so some of the numbers can be large, and they are episodic. So, if there weren't necessarily any pattern to unpack; it was just sort of coincidence, if you will, that we had these large numbers on both sides. On the inflows, there's really almost just really just three large clients that came in. There was a client that was more than a couple of billion, another one for a $1 billion, and another close to $1 billion, so these are really large numbers. And they were in assorted strategies, and not -- I wouldn't say there were any patterns to unpack in terms of any particular strategy, it was just that the strategies that these clients came in, and they came in large numbers. And it happened to be that these three large inflows happened to be in the same quarter. On the outflow side, similar story; that we had really a large client close to a couple billion, another client more than $1 billion, another client sort of similar number, different strategies that just happened to be in the same quarter. So, it was quite sort of a -- quite a bit of a coincidence that it just all happened in one quarter. But, yes, it all sort of cancelled each other out, so that's interesting. And we don't -- going forward, if you guess, the best sort of -- another part of your question. As we've guided in the past few quarters, we see more of a breakeven-to-flat cadence that we do have. And the pipeline remains healthy across stages. We have a good pipeline across different strategies, and across different stages. And we still see some pressures from managed volatility strategies, among other. We see rebalancing going on by clients in these rising equity markets when they take some chips off the table. There are some clients that are moving to a fixed income as a way to manage their -- [technical difficulty] profiling the liability-driven investing. So, all of those puts and takes, we think about a breakeven kind of cadence for a few quarters here.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thanks. And just a follow-up question on capital allocation, just curious how you're thinking about and planning to approach that as we move in here in the second-half and into '25, cash balance $72 million I think you mentioned. How should we think about that potentially going down, if at all, just given, I know, in the past I think you've mentioned you think about minimum cash levels that you need to run the business is meaningfully lower than that. So, what can we expect in terms of buybacks here as we go forward? Thank you.\nSuren Rana: Yes, thanks, Mike. Yes, we think about minimum cash levels around $20 million or thereabouts, so you could say that maybe they're close to $50 million is for other uses. And as we've said earlier, the two main uses remain the buybacks and seeding opportunities to accelerate our organic growth. So, we remain mindful and opportunistic on both of those fronts. We seeded just in this quarter, as we mentioned in the release, we seeded our third credit strategy which was the U.S. Investment Grade strategy. So, we have a sizable seed pool now, so there might be some recycling that happens within the pool. But still, if we get opportunities to seed more and to yield opportunities for organic growth we might do that. And we'll also look at the buybacks as we go. So, there isn't any particular formula we have. We'll remain opportunistic on both. We don't feel like we necessarily have to buy back our shares every quarter, particularly as I touched on, with that $50 million kind of a number. It's not that much to put to work. So, we'll just -- we'll remain opportunistic here.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live.\nKenneth Lee: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just one on the fee rate, there was, I think, a slight pickup in the fee rate in the quarter. Wondering whether it was just due to mix shift and, if so, were there any particularly fee rate products that contributed to the fee rate there? Thanks.\nSuren Rana: Hi, Ken. Yes, I think the answer was in the first part of your guess, largely it's the mix that does impact the fee rate a little bit now because some of our strategies are higher fee, and some are lower fee. So, clearly one of the factors was that the emerging markets' indices in the second quarter did relatively well. They had been lagging for a while. But in Q2, they did better than some of the other indices, [EC] (ph) and others, and they have higher fee. So that was part of -- that was probably most of it, and some other puts and takes.\nKenneth Lee: Got you, thanks. And just one follow-up, if I may, just in terms of the share repurchases capital allocation there. Would you expect to see a renewal of your -- the Board to renew there the share repurchase authorization sometime in the near-term? Thanks.\nSuren Rana: Yes, thanks, Ken. Yes, as I said, the uses for the capital remain on seeding organic growth opportunities and buybacks. It's, as I said, the excess capital right now is not that much that it's burning a hole in our pocket. So, there isn't necessarily super urgency on that. But yes, in due course, we would expect to get new authorization for buybacks.\nKenneth Lee: Got you, very helpful there. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John Dunn with Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nJohn Dunn: Thank you. A question on the outlook for further expense control from here and your ability to keep expenses in check?\nSuren Rana: Hi, John. Yes, as we've talked about over the last couple of years, we had a lot of expense increases in the last couple of years as we were really investing in our infrastructure. We invested in our trading infrastructure. We added to our investor reporting capabilities. So, we were really building out a lot now, in the sense of making our franchise more scalable. So we have done a fair bit of that over the last couple of years. And at the same time, we also faced pressures from inflation on the cost of data and -- because inflation was everywhere; so that's abated. So it appears that now, having built up a lot over the last couple of years, and having faced inflation, we are now in a good position to keep the expenses more or less at these levels, barring, of course, the general increases that you would see, sort of cost of living-type of increases, 2%-3% kind of levels. So, that's what I touched on, that we do have the operating leverage as our revenue grows, either from market growth or organic growth, we should be able to keep the operating expenses relatively at these levels. So, we should have disproportionate benefit as revenue increases.\nJohn Dunn: Got it. And maybe could you give us a little color on the conversations you're having with clients about potentially a pickup in demand for emerging market strategies?\nSuren Rana: Yes, there are sort of a variety of opinions, and depends on, also, the type of client. As you can imagine, many clients view that as sort of a -- because there's always rotation in terms of higher performance markets. And emerging markets have been lagging for such a long time. So, many clients view that as an opportunity and whose time may be coming soon, if you will, just the levels of valuations overall in emerging markets, in China in particular. So, we're seeing that. On the other hand, there may be some clients who are little bit worried about the geopolitical situation, and worry about the risks, particularly -- and then there are some political factors from state clients. So, it's a mixed bag, but I think, everything said and done, so far we haven't seen much of a pattern either in terms of a lot of inflows or a lot of outflows. We are seeing inflows in that strategy, that it's a strategy that we really have excellent -- very strong top performance. So, if somebody does want to allocate, we would have really one of the best chances, and so we're seeing inflows in that strategy; we're also seeing some outflows.\nJohn Dunn: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Suren Rana.\nSuren Rana: Thank you, Operator, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Have a good one.",
